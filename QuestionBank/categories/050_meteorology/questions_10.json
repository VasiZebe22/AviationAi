ICAO Aerodrome Meteorological Observation and Forecast Study Group (AMOFSG) A COMPARISON OF RVR AND VISIBILITY REPORTS 2. Discussion Previous studies have shown that the reported value of RVR is typically higher than the associated visibility value. In fact, empirical rules can be used to relate values of visibility with the most probable value of RVR (see IP3 from the sixth meeting of this study group). These findings are consistent with the fact that the assessment of RVR takes advantage of high intensity runway lights while the visibility assessment is based upon lights of moderate intensity Note: \"measured with ceilometers alongside the runway.\" INCORRECT. RVR is measured with transmissometers. A ceilometer is a device that uses a laser or other light source to determine the height of a cloud ceiling or cloud base \"reported when meteorological visibility is less than 2 000 m.\" INCORRECT. RVR is reported when the visibility decreases below 1500 m.",

In the southern hemisphere, over the sea: The surface wind veers by 10º/15º and speed reduces to 70% when compared to geostrophic winds. Therefore, the surface wind will blow from 125º + 15º = 140º",

During the descent towards Deauville, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. Sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between cloud bases of 1 500-3 000ft and tops of 5 000 - 8 000ft. Moderate icing and turbulence are forecast within this clouds. The 0°C level in sector \"B\" is between 4 000 ft and 6 000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0°C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case.

Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud or fog. If you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

A SPECI is special weather report issued when there is significant deterioration or improvement in airport weather conditions, such as significant changes of surface winds, visibility, cloud base height and occurrence of severe weather. The SPECI will not just include the changed condition, it should include a full report of all conditions, including the condition(s) that has triggered the SPECI. - The format of the SPECI report is very similar to that of the METAR and the elements used have the same meaning. The identifier METAR or SPECI at the beginning of the weather report differentiates them. ICAO Annex 3 - Appendix 3, 2.3 contains the criteria for issuing a SPECI, and recommends that a SPECI should be issued:. b) when the visibility is improving and changes to or passes through one or more of the following values, or when the visibility is deteriorating and passes through one or more of the following values: 1) 800, 1 500 or 3 000 m; and 2) 5 000 m, in cases where significant numbers of flights are operated in accordance with the visual flight rules;.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation (shadowing) is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",
