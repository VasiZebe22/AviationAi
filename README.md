# AviationAI Project
Project by two gays united by the need of $$$

Backend Status:

### Detailed Backend Work for the AviationAI Project
-

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Installed Tools:**
  - Node.js and npm for managing the backend environment. (18.20.5LTS)
  - Git for version control.
  - Postman for API testing.
  - Firebase Admin SDK for authentication.
  - OpenAI SDK for interacting with OpenAI's API.
- **Initialized Project:**
  - Set up `package.json` with all necessary dependencies.
  - Created essential files (`index.js`, `.env`, `firebase.js`, `.gitignore`).

---

### **2. Firebase Integration**
- **Set Up Firebase Admin:**
  - Generated Firebase private key and integrated Firebase Admin SDK.
  - Configured the `firebase.js` file to initialize Firebase and provide reusable functions.
- **Implemented Authentication:**
  - **User Registration (`/register`):**
    - Allows new users to sign up.
    - Creates users in Firebase Authentication.
    - Tested successfully with Postman.
  - **User Login (`/login`):**
    - Verifies user credentials and generates Firebase tokens.
    - Successfully tested multiple scenarios.
  - **Protected Routes Middleware:**
    - Middleware added to validate Firebase tokens for secured routes.
    - Ensures only authenticated users can access specific endpoints.

---

### **3. OpenAI Integration**
- **Initial Work with OpenAI API:**
  - Set up OpenAI SDK and API key.
  - Created `/query` endpoint for AI interactions.
  - Tested embeddings and completions using OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Transition to OpenAI Assistant API:**
  - Replaced manual embeddings and completions with the OpenAI Assistant feature for simplicity and efficiency.
  - Integrated the Assistant API (`/assistant-query`) to provide intelligent responses based on PDFs uploaded to the OpenAI Assistant.
  - Verified proper handling of queries with simplified JSON payloads.

---

### **4. File Management and PDF Handling**
- **Initial File Handling (Now Removed):**
  - Supported uploading, processing, and querying text from PDF and plain text files.
  - Used `multer` for file uploads and `pdf-parse` for text extraction from PDFs.
  - Removed these features after transitioning to OpenAI Assistant.
- **Clean-Up:**
  - Removed all file-handling-related code and dependencies (e.g., `multer`, `pdf-parse`).
  - Ensured the backend is focused solely on authentication and AI API interactions.

---

### **5. API Development**
- **Endpoints Created:**
  - **`/`**: Basic homepage route confirming server status.
  - **`/test-firebase`**: Validates Firebase Admin setup.
  - **`/register`**: Handles user registration.
  - **`/login`**: Manages user authentication.
  - **`/assistant-query`**: Sends queries to OpenAI Assistant API and retrieves responses.
- **Tested All Endpoints:**
  - Used Postman to verify the functionality of all routes.
  - Fixed issues like improper JSON bodies, missing tokens, and authorization errors.

---

### **6. Environment Management**
- **.env Configuration:**
  - Centralized sensitive data like Firebase credentials, OpenAI API keys, and Assistant IDs in the `.env` file.
- **Added `.gitignore`:**
  - Excluded sensitive files like `.env` and unnecessary files like `node_modules`.

---

### **7. Backend Clean-Up and Organization**
- **Removed Deprecated Features:**
  - Eliminated all unnecessary routes, such as `/upload` and `/preprocess`.
  - Removed dependencies related to file handling.
- **Refactored Code:**
  - Organized backend into modular files (`index.js` and `firebase.js`).
  - Simplified API request handling by using OpenAI Assistant API.
- **Maintained GitHub Repository:**
  - Regular commits with clear messages.
  - Removed untracked files and ensured `.gitignore` functionality.

---

### **8. Integration Testing**
- **Postman Tests:**
  - Verified all API endpoints.
  - Confirmed secure handling of Firebase authentication.
  - Validated OpenAI Assistant API functionality with queries.
- **Resolved Bugs:**
  - Fixed token validation issues with Firebase middleware.
  - Addressed query formatting errors with OpenAI Assistant API.

---

### **9. OpenAI Assistant Integration**
- **Assistant Configuration:**
  - Set up an Assistant on the OpenAI platform.
  - Uploaded PDFs for training the Assistant.
  - Assigned an Assistant ID and linked it with the backend.
- **Query Handling:**
  - Designed the `/assistant-query` route to interact with the OpenAI Assistant API.
  - Verified accurate and context-based responses.

---

### **10. Future-Proofing**
- **Security Measures:**
  - Ensured sensitive data is protected through environment variables.
  - Added Firebase token validation for secure access.
- **Scalability:**
  - Backend designed to accommodate future features like user data storage and subscription management.
