            "explanation": "Polar maritime (mPc) is the most common air mass to affect the British Isles. Cold, moist, NW airflow. This air mass is characterised by frequent showers at any time of the year. On approaching the UK, the warmer ground causes the air mass to warm from below, becoming unstable. This gives rise to Cumulus and Cumulonimbus, heavy showers (sometimes hail and thunderstorms). Visibility is good (except in showers). At night inland the cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal conditions for radiation fog. If an air mass flows from cold to warmer regions, it will be heated from underneath, which makes it unstable. Therefore, polar and arctic air masses become unstable, whereas tropical air masses become more stable when travelling to colder areas. Further info on Air Masses: Air masses are classified according to moisture content, source or type and temperature using a 3-letter system: First letter - moisture content: Continental (c) Maritime (m) Second letter - source region or type (latitude/temperature): Equatorial. (E) Tropical. (T) Polar. (P) Arctic. (A) Third letter: temperature, c(old) or w(arm) Hence the 5 air masses aﬀecting Europe are: AIR MASS SOURCE SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS Arctic maritime, mAc Polar ice cap. Only experienced during NH winter stable very cold and dry. POLAR MARITIME, mPc Northwest area of North Atlantic stable, cold, absolute humidity low, relative humidity high Polar Continental, cPc Siberia (winter only) northern Russia Stable, very cold and dry. it is typically colder than the Arctic maritime air Tropical Maritime, mTw The Azores anticyclone Warm, stable, absolute humidity high, RH high. Tropical continental, cTw N Africa/SE Europe warm, dry, stable.",

            "explanation": "Refer to figure Ahead of a warm front, freezing rain can be encountered. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes. Now, let's analyse each option individually: \"Fly along searching for an opening.\" and \"Orbit and wait for improvement.\". Incorrect. The question states that the pilot is in the planning phase, it does not make sense to plan an orbit. In such circumstances, it is safer and cost-effective to delay the departure. Furthermore, flying along the front trying to find an opening is rarely an option due to fuel available and airspace restrictions. \"Descend low as possible, staying at 500 ft AGL, even if it means flying below MSA and entering IMC.\" Incorrect. MSA stands for minimum sector altitude, an aircraft must not descend below the local MSA. \"Plan his/her route through the warm front on the shortest way possible.\" Correct. This is the most correct option available. Avoid any signs of precipitation.",

D-A => is the only track crossing the occlusion, in the cross-section view (bottom figure). The figure on the top depicts a warm occlusion. Therefore, this is the correct option. C-A => This track first crosses a cold front and, shortly after, crosses a warm front. In this case, the top figure would show both fronts (warm and cold) separately and touching the ground, with a space between the fronts. B-C => This track crosses a warm front only. For that reason, on the top figure, we would only see one frontal system – warm front originating from the ground. B-A => This track crosses a cold front only.

Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the warm front. Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low. ADVECTION FOG. Often observed behind a warm front. Note:\"The wind backs more at the warm front than at the cold front.\" INCORRECT. At the both the warm and cold front, the wind veers sharply. \"While occluding the warm front always becomes a front aloft.\" INCORRECT. In a warm occlusion, the cold air behind the cold front rises over the colder air ahead of the warm fron => cold front aloft. \"The precipitation zone of the cold front is in general wider than the precipitation zone of the warm front.\" INCORRECT.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.06.02.08.01: Describe the movements of fronts and pressure systems and the life cycle of a mid-latitude depression. A mid latitude depression (also called a polar front depression, or a travelling low), is a key part of the global climate and air circulation pattern. It sits on the \"Polar Front\", which is the front between the cold Polar Cell and the warmer Ferrel Cell of the atmosphere, somewhere between 30° and 70° N/S, depending on the season. From here on we will discuss it in relation to the Northern Hemisphere, but just reverse the North and South directions for the Southern Hemisphere Polar Front. To the North of the Polar Front sits the high pressure zone of the North Pole and the very cold Arctic Circle. To the South of the Polar front sits the subtropical high pressure belt (the Azores high in the Atlantic). This means that the air wants to flow towards the Polar Front from both directions (pressure gradient force), but the air turns right due to the Coriolis effect, so the wind to the North of the front is East-to-West and the air to the South of the front is West-East. This scenario is unstable, and gives rise to travelling lows. Refer to the annex above - it uses different names for the stages. Initial stage (Frontogenesis) - The first stage is triggered by a small change in circumstances, the triggers are many, but are not important. The warm air mass begins to push into the cold air mass, creating a kink in the previously non-moving Polar Front. Mature Stage - This is where the cold sector begins to \"fight back\", and develops a cold front to claim back some of the land from the warm sector. The depression usually reaches its lowest pressure in this stage, and this stage can last for a good few days. It brings the familiar view of a cold front \"chasing a warm front\". Occluded Stage - The cold front has now caught up to the warm front at the centre of the depression, where the weather appears to look like both fronts pass together. Here, the warm sector no longer reaches the ground, and has been lifted into the air in this region. The fronts continue to occlude, and act like a clothing zipper, \"zipping up\" from the base out towards the edge. Dying Stage - The fronts are now almost completely occluded, and the depression is beginning to \"fill in\" with pressure. The whole system is beginning to collapse and the warm sector which initially invaded has become isolated from the rest of the warm air to the south, and is forced upwards into the atmosphere where it will disperse. A few things can happen here, including back-bent occlusions, and secondary depressions which may continue to develop. The dying stage is often accelerated by the depression moving over land, where the air has more friction with the land, and there is no longer a steady source of moisture beneath to feed the system. Through this whole life cycle, the system is moving towards the East (with some North/South movement according to the Jetstream, Polar Front, etc.), as the wind in the warm sector controls the direction.",

We cannot see how this is possible, so please send us any further feedback you may have about this, thank you! Mid Latitude Depression development 1. CYCLOGENESIS STAGE – this is known as the initial stage of the cyclone’s life cycle. In this stage, a boundary separates opposing fronts of cold and warm air. When an upper level disturbance moves over the front, it causes a wave to form. Cyclonic shear begins to happen when the warm and cold fronts slide against each other => which generates the spinning motion characteristic of cyclones. 2. DEVELOPED/MATURE STAGE – during this stage, the wave formed during the initial phase grows as warm air replaces the space left behind by moving the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front, intensifying the cyclonic circulation. 3. OCCLUDED STAGE - In the mid-latitude cyclone’s third stage, the denser cold front catches up with the warm front. Because the warm air isn’t dense enough to displace the cold air ahead of it, it shifts up and slides above the cold air in its path. This action eventually forms an occluded front, in which the wave transforms into a loop, which is narrower at its base and cuts off the supply of warm air. 4. DISSOLVING/ FRONTOLYSIS STAGE - The final stage of the cyclone occurs when the loop formed by the cold front boundary surrounding the low-pressure pocket of warm air closes. This cuts off the supply of warm moist air and the lifting force caused by the interaction between the cold and warm fronts. The loss of the convergence and uplift mechanisms cause the cyclone to dissolve, and the low pressure system gradually stabilizes.",

            "explanation": "The figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. At location 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. Ahead of the warm front where the freezing level in the cold air is lower than the freezing level in the warm air above it, as the rain falls from the warmer air (above 0°C) into the cold air (below 0°C) below it freezes, forming freezing rain. This would line up with the METAR in the question. At location 3, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter. Location 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. Location 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus.

Air masses are categorized based on their basic temperature and humidity attributes. Consequently, a tropical air mass will not exhibit the characteristics of a cold air mass. However, this distinction pertains to its properties in its source region. During winter, the maritime tropical air mass migrates toward the poles and undergoes cooling from contact with the Earth's surface. Although the original tropical air mass lacks the attributes of a \"cold air mass temperature and humidity,\" the tropical air, when altered by traversing colder surfaces, can acquire such properties.",

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80. Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur. NOTE: Cumulus clouds are the most common cloud types that are produced by cold fronts. They often grow into cumulonimbus clouds, which produce thunderstorms. Cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus, stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.",

            "explanation": "Warm front clouds form a distinctive pattern as a warm front approaches. These clouds typically appear 800-1 000 km ahead of the surface position of the warm front. The sequence of cloud types you can observe starts with CI (cirrus clouds), then progresses to CS (cirrostratus), AS (altostratus), and finally NS (nimbostratus) along with low-level stratus clouds. Notably, the cloud base tends to lower as the warm front draws near. While it's rare, unstable warm fronts can occasionally feature CB (cumulonimbus) clouds, bringing associated hazards. Let's examine each option separately: \"In summer, the warm front is often accompanied by freezing rain or freezing drizzle close to the surface. In winter, the icing conditions close to the surface are less severe than in the summer, due to the lower moisture content of the air.\" Incorrect. In fact, winter is the season when warm fronts are more commonly associated with freezing rain or drizzle due to the lower temperatures. \"In summer, the warm fronts are in most cases accompanied with heavy showers of rain and severe thunderstorms, produced by embedded Ns clouds.\" Incorrect. While thunderstorms can occur with unstable warm fronts, they are usually not produced by embedded nimbostratus clouds (Ns). Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are more likely sources of thunderstorms in such cases. \"In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is smaller than in the summer, and therefore the average upper winds are weaker than in the summer.\" Incorrect. In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is typically greater, which can result in stronger upper-level winds compared to the summer.",

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. Conditions associated with a cold front: Surface winds: Sudden change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of a cold front. Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the warmer air mass) are typically out of the southwest, but once the front passes through, winds usually shift around to the northwest (in the colder air mass). Temperature: steady before the front. A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold). Pressure: before the front, it decreases slightly. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front. Clouds: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB. However, if the air is stable cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (and stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.) Precipitation: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected. Along with thunderstorms and hail, if the air is unstable. Visibility: good, except in precipitation. => Considering the above, we can conclude a cold front in stable atmosphere is being described.",

In summer the characteristics of the mTw air mass over the oceans and in zones of cyclonic activity are basically the same as in winter.

This is a huge source of air masses for much of the Northern Hemisphere. 2: A tropical continental air mass can be a cold air mass. CORRECT Air mass theory is more about where the air mass comes from and how it is altered before and as it reaches a location. So if a warmer air mass moves over a place that is colder, it’s comparatively a warm air mass. That doesn’t mean that if that area of air moved in another direction it would be a warm air mass for them too, it is all relative. So if a tropical air mass moved south over to a warmer area (an equatorial area would likely be hotter), then comparatively, the tropical air mass would be colder air than the base conditions at that location. There are 4 different adjectives we use for air masses, from coldest to warmest; Arctic, Polar, Tropical, Equatorial. Each can be continental (dry) or maritime (wet), and this depends on the source region and the track it has taken.",

When a cold air mass advects over a warmer surface (Polar air moving towards the tropics, for example), the lower layers of air are heated by the ground, which creates instability. It can be though of that the low level warm air wants to rise through the cold air, which is an unstable air mass. That is not exactly how it works, but is a good way to remember it. If air were to move from a warm source region to a colder area of surface, the warm air would be cooled from below, creating a stable air mass. It can be thought of like this; the cold air is more than happy to sit below a warmer air mass, so remains stable. Instability causes cumuliform clouds, which cause rain to fall as showers and storms, whereas stability tends to create stratiform clouds and fog, with rain falling lighter but more continuously. Cold Polar air moving over Australia is a cold air mass moving over a warmer surface, so will cause instability and showers.",

Yes, a warm occlusion will include a bit of cold front at altitude, but as it is a warm occlusion, the majority of it acts as a warm front. This leaves us with a fast-moving cold front and a slow-moving cold front. This is slightly counterintuitive, as one might think that a fast moving cold front is likely to be more \"aggressive\" than a slow-moving one, but it is actually the opposite. Meteorologists call slow-moving cold fronts \"active cold fronts\". This is because their slower movement means that the associated uplift is more gradual, and with a slightly shallower slope, gives rise to a much wider band of convective clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation and turbulence, going up the side of the front, which spreads the weather over a long distance. fast-moving cold fronts are referred to as \"inactive cold fronts\". This is a bit of a misnomer, as they still cause plenty of aggressive uplift, which leads to significant bands of thunderstorms and heavy convection in unstable atmospheric conditions, but the band of thunderstorms is much thinner, and remains ahead of the front (not up the sloped side of the front like slow-moving cold fronts). This is why the answer is that thunderstorms, CBs and convective clouds are more likely to be encountered at and around a slow-moving cold front.",

            "explanation": "FREEZING RAIN. The conditions needed for freezing rain are quite specific. Generally, precipitation first falls from a cloud as snow. If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground, the droplets can become supercooled (which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0ºC). Ahead of the warm front where the freezing level in the cold air (approx. at 3500 ft in this case) is lower than the freezing level in the warm air above it (approx. at 5500 ft in this case) => As the rain falls from the warmer air (above 0°C) into the cold air (below 0°C) below it freezes => forming freezing rain. Nimbostratus clouds present in square \"3C\" will be mostly produce heavy and continuous rain => Therefore, below the frontal surface in square \"3C\" (and especially between 3 500 ft and 5 500 ft) => we will experience Freezing Rain (FZRA) Freezing rain/rain ice does not freeze immediately in the air but can impact the aerofoil to form clear ice or rime ice. Rain ice occurs in a narrow range of altitudes at low level ahead of a warm front (in this case, approaching square 3C from 3D) or occlusion and is associated particularly with the moderate continuous rain which often falls from nimbostratus cloud.",

            "explanation": "The figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. At point 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain (sometimes heavy rain) ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. At point 3, long since the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the Winter. This would line up with the METAR in the question. Point 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. Point 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties. The lack of rain/heavy rain and NOSIG (no significant changes expected in the next two hours) in the METAR rule out point 4, where rain/heavy rain is pretty much guaranteed, and changes are very much expected within the next 2 hours as the cloud lowers and the warm front passes.",

            "explanation": "An occluded front is formed when a cold front and a warm front merge together. Usually, a cold front will catch up with the preceding warm front, and the warm sector of air will be trapped, and lifted up from the surface. An occlusion usually takes on the form of both fronts in quick succession, and the weather in the central part of the occlusion will be decided by the type of occlusion, warm or cold. The type of occlusion is simply which front stays connected to the ground. If the warm front remains intact, and the cold front \"rides\" up it, then the warm front is still touching the ground, and it is a warm occlusion. The frontal weather acts more like a warm front in this case, and the majority of the rain occurs before the front hits, and the weather will gradually clear after the surface front has passed. On the other hand, if the cold front forces the warm front up, then the occlusion is a cold occlusion. This acts more like a cold front. Cold fronts are responsible for strong, severe storms. The weather tends to exhibit a dip in temperature prior to the storms and a drastic change in wind direction and speed. After the front passes, there is usually a rapid clearance in the weather. The type of occlusion depends on which sector of air is coldest. Of course, the warmest sector is forced upwards in between two colder sectors of air. If the back sector is coldest, then it will be a cold occlusion. If the front section is the coldest, then the back section will be comparatively warm, and a warm occlusion will form. In Europe, we usually see cold occlusions in Summer and warm occlusions in Winter (the opposite temperature of the season). This is because the winds into Western Europe are from the Atlantic and, in Summer, the ground is warmer than the water, so the front sector (which has already reached ground) is warmer than the back sector (still over water), and therefore a cold occlusion is most common.",

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80. Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur. NOTE: Cumulus clouds are the most common cloud types that are produced by cold fronts. They often grow into cumulonimbus clouds, which produce thunderstorms. Cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus, stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.",

            "explanation": "This situation is quite complex to forecast, but there are some absolutes that we know. High pressure zones such as this anticyclone will give clear weather due to the subsidence of air, which will mean dry days and very cold nights during the winter (20th February). The ground will therefore be very cold after a few days of this. Water is not as affected by this, as it holds its heat much better, so will be warmer than the land. This cold land does make fog very likely in the mornings, namely radiation fog, which occurs when the land cools the lower layers of air until they reach their dewpoint, however, the question is not asking about the morning, instead about the afternoon and evening. This would no longer be affected by radiation fog, which will have been removed over most of the country by this point in the day due to solar insolation (there is not much solar insolation, during winter, but enough to remove the fog). There will still be some other fog, though, at the coasts where the wind is blowing from the sea. This is advection fog. Advection fog forms when warm, humid air, flows over a cold surface; in this case, the warmer, more humid sea air blowing over the colder land. The low level air then quickly cools to its dewpoint and forms fog. The wind is likely to be quite light at this point, but will likely be more than 5 kts from the Irish sea towards the coast of Wales (red arrows in annex above), which is just enough to form advection fog. Furthermore, we can see a cold front moving southwards nearby, so there must be some wind in that area. The other options require a lot of cloud, which would not occur in a high pressure zone like this (where air subsides), and the option stating \"radiation fog\" is a morning phenomenon, not one that would happen in the afternoon/evening, as explained above. Note: This question does require a little bit of geography knowledge, such as the location of Ireland and Wales. Similar knowledge of European geography is required in many questions, so is a good thing to learn, if not already known.

            "explanation": "LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM/DEPRESSION. Is an area which has a lower air pressure than the surroundings (the value of the isobars increase with distance from the centre). Isobars are closely spaced together. In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude. If the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers, Weather associated with Low Pressure Systems: - CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause - PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression. - VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air - TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air - WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.

                "CORRECT"
            ],
            "explanation": "See the comments - conflicting feedback. (1) Polar lows are formed over water only. CORRECT. Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours. Like their tropical cousins, polar lows tend to decay rapidly with landfall, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This is the reason that they do not occur naturally over land (see note below). (2) Thermal lows are formed over land only. INCORRECT. Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong. Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area. Thermal lows are most common over land masses but they can form over water when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season. Note: this question is very highly contested, and it seems that some authorities disagree on the correct answer. For instance the Polish and Hungarian authority believe that \"1 only\" is the wrong answer and we believe that they choose \"both correct\" as the correct answer, even though we have good feedback from other authorities that \"1 only\" correct. We say that the second most correct answer is \"none\", as there can be debate as to the formation of polar lows; where they usually form over water, could they occur completely over land? We have to go off the exam feedback, and so would appreciate any further feedback on this question in the comments, or sent to info@atplquestions.com. See Question 507748 for the other version of this question, which we believe the UK CAA are using (and maybe other authorities), and has a more objective answer.",

Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence), lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation. Subsidence is, therefore, a sinking motion of air, present in the core of a High Pressure System. The subsidence, a sinking motion of air, is present in the core of a HIGH => the air gets compressed and adiabatically heated and stability increases.",

An anticyclone is a region of relatively high pressure. Usually, the isobars of an anticyclone are more widely spaced than with depressions, and anticyclones move much slower, and can sometimes sit for weeks in a single location (called a blocking anticyclone). There are five types of anticyclone: warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges and blocking. Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are very few clouds within the high pressure core, but anticyclones can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath. CBs can form due to thermal uplift in the afternoon, but this is made more difficult by the subsiding air. Usual Anticyclonic Weather: > Summer Cloud: Very little to none. Occasional clouds towards the edges of the anticyclone. Precipitation: None. Visibility: Generally moderate with haze (often reducing with time as the haze becomes worse). Temperature: Dependent on type (Warm anticyclones bring warmer temperatures than cold ones). Often a large temperature difference between day and night. Winds: Light. > Winter Cloud: Extensive stratus with a low base and limited vertical extent. Precipitation: Possibly drizzle. Visibility: Generally moderate to poor with mist and fog likely. Temperature: Relatively warm. Winds: Light.",

One starts high pressure and gets higher with altitude (warm high), and the other starts high pressure and gets lower with altitude (cold high). Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW). Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights; they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate high pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate low pressure.",

            ],
            "explanation": "(1) Polar lows are formed over water only. CORRECT. Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours. Like their tropical cousins, polar lows tend to decay rapidly with landfall, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This may well be the reason that they do not occur naturally over land. (2) Thermal lows are mainly formed over land. CORRECT. Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong. Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via re-radiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area. Thermal lows are most common over land masses but they can form over water when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season. Note: This is an offshoot question from Q501594 which has plenty of conflicting feedback. It appears that the UK CAA have decided to change option 2 to say \"mainly formed over land\", which is now correct. Any further exam feedback on this question can be placed in the comments here, and for the other question, search for 501594 and read the comments there, where there is more information. Thank you!",

Please send us any further exam feedback in the comments, on the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! A small-scale intense low pressure zone on route would be likely to bring very unsettled weather in that region. The inflow of air near the surface leads to air rising in the core of the low pressure region, and this brings large convective cloud formations, particularly in summer. This would be very likely to cause CBs and thunderstorms. Of course, these would be associated with heavy rainfall and turbulence, as well as icing, wind shear, hail, lightning, etc. As for visibility, low pressure zones like this tend to have good visibility outside of the clouds/precipitation as the mixing of air makes sure the particles causing bad visbility do not sit in a haze (as happens with high pressure). However, there is no option that says this, so for now we have to just assume they are talking about the very poor visibility in the clouds and precipitation (until we get any feedback that changes or verifies the options).",

TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas. In the northern hemisphere (NH), conditions on the right-hand side of storms are more severe than those on their left-hand sides. For that reason, in the NH, Right-hand semicircle (RHSC) is called the “dangerous semicircle” and Left-hand semicircle (LHSC) is called the “navigable semicircle”. Dangerous semicircle— It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the right of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern Hemisphere (to the left in the Southern Hemisphere), where the storm has the strongest winds and heavy seas. Navigable semicircle — It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the left of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern hemisphere (to the right in the Southern Hemisphere), where the winds are weaker and better for the navigation purpose, although all parts of TRS are more or less dangerous to mariners.

Isobars are closely spaced together. In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude. If the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers, Weather associated with Low Pressure Systems: - CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause - PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression. - VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air - TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air - WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.",

Such a region of slow moving air can prevent other, faster moving pressure systems from moving into a region. For this reason, they are known as Blocking Highs or BLOCKING ANTICYCLONES. The blocking anticyclone starts as a ridge of high pressure extending from a high pressure source region such as the sub-tropical Azores High (annex above) which breaks off and establishes itself as a separate anticyclone. Typically, found in the regions between 40ºN and 70ºN and may persist for several days giving (usually) warm dry weather in summer and stable, cold conditions in winter, mostly clear but with potential for light mist and drizzle. Blocking anticyclones can exist as both warm and cold (from Siberia or Greenland) anticyclones, but the strongest ones are theoretically warm anticyclones, as they maintain their higher pressure up to the tropopause, and are therefore longer lasting. The feedback for this question regularly shows this answer as being correct, but we believe it is wrong in assuming that it is a warm anticyclone.",

Any high or anticyclone that remains nearly stationary or moves slowly compared to the west to east motion upstream from its location, preventing the usual eastwards movement of frontal depressions and forcing these to take up northerly tracks (NH). These anticyclones are usually extensions of warm subtropical anticyclones, especially in summer, but can also be extensions of the siberian cold anticyclone in winter times. They can sometimes persist for weeks. Weather associated with blocking highs: Warm dry weather in summer and gloomy overcast conditions in winter with a possibility of drizzle.

This gives a clockwise flow around \"J\", which would make it a low pressure zone in the Southern Hemisphere (due to Buys Ballot's Law). The frontal activity centred close to \"J\". This looks like an occluded front with standard cold and warm fronts in a \"zipper\" pattern, and is indicative of a low pressure zone. \"G\" is a textbook looking blocking anticyclone with a high pressure ridge marked by \"E\". The surface wind is also pointing slightly away from \"G\" rather than following the isobars, proving again that \"G\" is high pressure.

The rising air is likely to reach the dew point before it reaches the top of the friction layer and a cloud will form. Note: “Orographic clouds” INCORRECT. They are formed when air meets a ridge and is forced to rise – which is not the case. “Convective clouds” INCORRECT.

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas. In the northern hemisphere (NH), conditions on the right-hand side of storms are more severe than those on their left-hand sides. For that reason, in the NH, Right-hand semicircle (RHSC) is called the “dangerous semicircle” and Left-hand semicircle (LHSC) is called the “navigable semicircle”. Dangerous semicircle— It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the right of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern Hemisphere (to the left in the Southern Hemisphere), where the storm has the strongest winds (The wind speed in the RHSC will be the sum of the cyclonic wind and the speed of the storm travel). Navigable semicircle — It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the left of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern hemisphere (to the right in the Southern Hemisphere), where the winds are weaker and better for the navigation purpose, although all parts of TRS are more or less dangerous to mariners. SUMMARY: The fastest winds are found in the quadrant to the right of the storm track in the Northern Hemisphere and left of the track in the Southern Hemisphere.",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

            "explanation": "Let's break down the components of the statement: (1) Convergence: Convergence refers to the coming together or convergence of air masses. In the context of a trough, it indicates that air is flowing toward the trough axis from different directions and meeting at that point. (2) Lifting: Lifting refers to the upward movement of air. In the presence of convergence, the air is forced to rise along the trough axis. This lifting motion can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. (3) Cumuliform clouds or squalls: Cumuliform clouds are large, puffy clouds with a vertical development, often associated with convection. Squalls are intense, localized storms characterized by strong winds and heavy precipitation. Along the line of the trough, the convergence and lifting can result in the formation of cumuliform clouds or trigger squall-like weather conditions. Detailed explanation: A trough is an extension of a low-pressure system. It is an area indicated by isobars that extend outwards from an area of low Pressure (typically forming a “V” shaped pattern). Troughs are very often associated with the fronts of polar front depressions. The weather associated with a trough will be similar to that of a depression. Weather associated with a Trough: CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression. VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air. TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air. WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

Tropical revolving storms always form in a Westwards direction, due to the NE and SE trade winds which form them. They always form at least 5º North or South of the Equator, and turn away from the Equator initially. Their tracks are always very difficult to forecast. As seen in the annex above, Cyclones in the South Indian Ocean (that is what Tropical Revolving Storms are called in that region) start Westwards/South-Westwards and turn gradually more to the South. They can continue round to South-Eastwards, but usually get over colder water by this point and begin to die down.",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures. => Therefore, low pressure at the surface - isobaric surfaces bulge downwards at the surface; high pressure in the upper air - isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in the upper air.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

They primarily form nearer to the poles in the cold Polar air masses, and (in the Northern Hemisphere), extend South towards warmer air. At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Under the Köppen climate classification system, the five main climate groups are A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar). In this system, each area of the world is given a 3-letter description (sometimes 2-letter description) of the climate, with this climate group as the first letter, followed by the seasonal rainfall descriptor, then a temperature descriptor. For this question, we can assume that equatorial means A - tropical climate, as this is most apt. The tropical climate exists around the equator, and has rain almost every day, sometimes all year round. (some places have dry seasons, occasionally twice a year.). Out of the 4 options for part 1, only the Congo Delta and the Brazilian rainforest are in tropical (equatorial) climate zones; the Kalahari Desert is dry, as is Mali in the Sahara Desert. For part 2, we are looking for temperate zones, which covers quite an array of temperatures, hot/cold summers, hot/cold winters, etc. all having separate climate letters. Temperate climate can be expected in South-Eastern states of the USA, most of Western Europe, a large area of SE China, SE Australia and New Zealand. They commonly have distinct seasons and good climates for growing many types of crops. Of the 4 options, only the New Zealand option is correct, as even the Northern Territories of Australia are on the colder end of the tropical climate regions.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

            "explanation": "The question text is, most likely, describing the Foehn Effect. Foehn winds. When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. The greatest risk of aircraft icing is found on the windward side of the mountain in saturated air and thick clouds, such as cumuliform clouds. Note: In this case, with wind coming from the west, the western side will be the windward side. Halfway up the slope, the air may not be saturated yet and condensation may not have started yet => risk of icing is, therefore, lower. At the height of the ridge is the most correct option since we don't know the saturation of the air before the ridge.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days. Note: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are \"cold pools\", but the new syllabus refers to them as \"cold-air drops\". They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure - They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upwind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

            "explanation": "COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks.

However, when averaged over many years a global pattern of air movement emerges. The reason we have different weather patterns is all because of the global atmospheric circulation caused by the rotation of the Earth and the amount of heat different parts of the globe receive. The sun is our main source of heat, and because of the tilt of the Earth, its curvature, our atmosphere, clouds and polar ice and snow, different parts of the world heat up differently. The change in angle leads to stronger insolation on the Northern Hemisphere from April to September, and stronger insolation on the Southern Hemisphere from October to March. Thus, different pressure areas which trigger a large circulation between the equator and the poles are formed. Because of the Earth´s rotation, a direct flow between anticyclone (equator) and depression (poles) is prevented. In the Northern hemisphere, the air masses are deflected to the right and in the Southern hemisphere to the left. For that reason, three large circulation cells are generated (Hadley cell, Ferrel cell and the Polar cell).",

It moves North in the Northern Hemisphere Summer and South in the Northern Hemisphere Winter. Therefore, the ITCZ is responsible for the wet and dry seasons in the tropics. The sun crosses the equator twice a year in March and September, and consequently makes for two wet seasons each year. In December and July, when the sun is at its greatest extent north or south of the equator makes for two dry seasons. Further away from the equator, the two wet seasons merge into one, and the climate becomes more monsoonal, with one wet season and one dry season. In the Northern Hemisphere the wet season occurs from May to July, in the Southern Hemisphere from November to February. As the ITCZ moves due to the seasons, it is therefore based on the Earth's position in orbit of the Sun. Note: The ITCZ is subject to large seasonal movement overland, but much less over the sea.",

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold air drops (cold pools) are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region. When they are present, there is a huge amount of cold air sat on top of a much warmer (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere. This means that there is a very high environmental lapse rate, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and this causes layers of massive instability. The large instability can cause heavy convective activity, including cumulonimbus clouds if the low level air is moist enough, meaning that they can be quite dangerous for aviation.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. In terms of weather, we can expect: • Upwind side: clouds, precipitation and poor visibility, • Downwind side: clear skies, good visibility, turbulence.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right slightly in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become the South-Westerly monsoons. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of India, the SW monsoon brings humid maritime air from the Indian Ocean. It hits the West coast of India directly, but does still affect the Eastern edge of India, as the heat of the Indian landmass effectively \"pulls in\" the air from the Bay of Bengal to the East, so on the Eastern side of India, the wind is more Southerly than South-Westerly. During the Winter months (December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the cooler air from the Siberian peninsula flows over the Indian subcontinent from the NE, called the NE monsoon. It is much drier and cooler than the SW monsoon.",

How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold air pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. Next, we will explore NE and SW Monsoons. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Note: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are \"cold pools\", but the new syllabus refers to them as \"cold-air drops\". They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable. COLD-AIR DROP/COLD POOL A cold-air drop is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposphere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. They are formed when cold air aloft breaks away from the polar region, making its way South (in the Northern Hemisphere), past the Polar front. They are not linked to mountains, so that option is not correct. The other options are easy to discount. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure - They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks.

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.

            "explanation": "MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Usually, these questions ask about the seasonal monsoon in India, but the layout of China, and particularly the location of Hong Kong on the South coast of China, create quite similar weather patterns. In summer, the ITCZ travels far North (with the Sun) into the large landmass of China, up as far as the Siberian Peninsula, and the ITCZ is a low pressure zone, so the air around it is drawn towards it. This means that the warm, moist air from the South China Sea is drawn up towards the land to the North. This wind is therefore from the South-West, causing very wet, humid weather, with lots of rainfall and occasional violent storms. In the winter, the winds are the opposite, due to the ITCZ travelling South to follow the Sun. The ITCZ now sits in the region of the South China Sea, and draws air from the landmass of China. This means that the air flowing over Hong Kong at the coast is much dryer, cooler air, which has travelled a long way over cooler land, before going out to see. This wind is from the North-East, and the conditions are dry.",

            "explanation": "COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Monsoon winds are caused by high and low-pressure zones which develop over large continents. They are particularly marked in South and Southeast Asia and also occur in West Africa. Weather will depend very much on the track followed. NE monsoons over central India will be dry with little cloud, whilst the SW monsoons will be warm and moist with much convective cloud and heavy rain. During the summer season (July), the average ITCZ position relative to India is approximately 23°N, resulting in SW trade winds prevailing (SW Monsoon). In the winter, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. \"2. The prevailing climatic zone in Australia is the dry climate\" Correct. Regions with dry climates are primarily situated along the subtropical high zones. The proportion of these areas in the Southern Hemisphere is much smaller than in the Northern Hemisphere.

When high pressure forms in the Bay of Biscay, and low pressure in the Gulf of Genoa, the wind lines up roughly with the valleys of Southern France, which will channel the air, and use the Venturi effect (amongst other effects) to increase the wind speed, and change the direction of the air to flow along the valley, towards the Mediterranean Sea. It is usually a cold wind, and usually occurs in dry weather, giving clear skies and of course, strong winds. Note: This question simply wants us to know that the Mistral is a valley wind.

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. During the SW Monsoon, which occurs in the summer months of June, July, and August, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts northward, away from the Equator. As the Southeast trade winds cross the equator, they change direction to the southwest, giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This monsoon follows a lengthy sea track, gathering moisture along the way. It results in the formation of dense Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds, leading to intense thunderstorms, low cloud bases, and severe turbulence. The impact on aviation is more significant compared to the NE Monsoon. The SW Monsoon has widespread effects, affecting regions such as India, Sri Lanka, Burma, the exposed coasts of West Malaysia, and the West African coast (including Guinea, Ghana, and North Nigeria). The accompanying annex illustrates the influence of the West African SW monsoon on countries north of the Gulf of Guinea.

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days. Note: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are \"cold pools\", but the new syllabus refers to them as \"cold-air drops\". They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable.",

            "explanation": "NOTE: The feedback for this question is incomplete and we have had to fill in some gaps ourselves, so this may be different in the exam. Please send us any further exam feedback you have, thank you! The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator. Here, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere. As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear. The ITCZ is a low pressure zone, due to the intense heating of the local air from the hot ground/sea, leading to large updrafts of air, which can form very violent thunderstorms, climbing to altitudes of 55-60 000 ft at their highest. Therefore, it can be very dangerous to fly in the region of the ITCZ. Mostly, this is due to rapidly changing, unpredictable, violent weather conditions. For this question though, that is not part of any of the options. Instead, this question is asking about the dangers of the ITCZ in terms of it being a low pressure area. A low pressure area can cause altimeters to overread if they are not set correctly. This sounds self-explanatory (\"Of course they don't work if you don't use them right!\"), but actually, it can lead to the aircraft being much lower than expected, either during times of rapid pressure changes, or when the aircraft is flying on flight levels, and therefore using 1013 hPa. In hot and low pressure areas, the aircraft's true altitude could be many thousands of feet below what is showing on the altimeter (pressure altitude). This is particularly dangerous around mountains, which this question mentions.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts. A cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region. This can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that the column of air in that region is much shorter than around it, as pressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass. The cold air becomes trapped, and usually forms a circle. This does form a low pressure zone higher up in the troposphere, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a huge amount of cold air sat on top of warm (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere. This means that there is a very high environmental lapse rate, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and this causes layers of massive instability. It can often only be seen by comparing pressure charts for different levels to see the change in pressure due to the thermal effect, but not by looking only at the surface pressure, where it may not be visible. The later stages of a cold-air drop usually ends up as a low pressure zone at the ground also, but this is not examined by EASA. The higher pressure chart should show an area of lower pressure that does not exist on the surface (or lower altitude) chart. This means that the thermal effect has taken place, and that the area has cold air in it. In this case, there are two possible diagrams which show a resemblance to this. Figure A and Figure D both show more low pressure on the 700 hPa charts that the surface charts. The difference between them is the size of the cold-air drop. Figure A shows lower pressure over the whole region of the image (which is in comparison to the area outside the image), meaning that the potential cold-air drop which has caused it would be very large. Figure D, however, shows a smaller, isolated cold-air drop (low pressure zone) in the middle of the 700 hPa chart, which did not appear on the surface chart which showed a neutral \"col\" pressure distribution. 700 hPa is approximately equivalent to 10,000ft, so the thermal effect has not had too much time to take effect, but at higher levels, the cold-air drop would be even more visible on the charts. Note: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. We have had enough feedback and a reply to an appeal from the Hungarian CAA that Figure A is correct, however we think figure D is also a possible cold air drop, and our initial feedback also supported that. See the comments for the most recent feedback, and keep putting exam feedback in the comments when possible, thank you!",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

The north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. FOEHN EFFECT Foehn winds are warm and dry, gusty winds that periodically descends the leeward slopes of nearly all mountains and mountain ranges (warm katabatic wind). This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. => One such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature. How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.

As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible.

            "explanation": "Note: We have changed this question to ask now about the formation of convective clouds within the ITCZ, and no longer just about the formation of the ITCZ. This is by far the more reported version, but please do let us know in the comments if you see a question that does NOT mention \"convective clouds\", but is similar to this question, thank you. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator. Here, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator of both the land and the oceans, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere. As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. These convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear. The air mass then flows outwards (both North and South), and finally subsides in the subtropical high pressure zones (between 30° - 40°N), also called the \"horse latitudes\", where the air moves downward toward Earth’s surface, forming a high pressure surface region with clear, warm weather. The subtropical highs then cause the trade winds, completing the cycle within the Hadley cell of the atmosphere. Storms within the ITCZ will often go as high as 50 - 60 000 ft, so cannot be escaped upwards by commercial jet aircraft, and must be avoided using lateral deviations. For this question then, the convergence of the trade winds greatly affects the formation of convective clouds in the ITCZ. The warm oceans also play a large part in how much humidity is available to form these convective clouds; the greater the humidity, the more intense the clouds and storms. The Easterly jet stream, also known as the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), is a significant feature in the tropical regions, especially during the summer months. It is characterized by strong easterly winds, blowing from east to west at high level. It is not technically classed as a jet stream in the usual sense, but is commonly referred to as such. It is formed when the ITCZ is significantly moved away from the equator, but will likely have a corresponding effect on the future ITCZ formation. It is a product of the ITCZ but has little to no effect on the convective clouds within the ITCZ.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. With regards to this question, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds. The north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer. Therefore, temperature is higher north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

For our syllabus, India has two primary seasons with transitional times between the two, explained by the SW and NE monsoons. A monsoon is a seasonal wind, and India experiences 2 monsoons during the year, The one in this question is the SW monsoon that blows during the summer (June - September), when the ITCZ is quite far Northwards, into and North of India and up to as far as the Siberian Peninsula. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure due to the intense heating, and therefore the surface wind flows towards it. This pulls warm water out of the Indian Ocean, turning into humid, unstable air masses over the hot Indian land mass, and can form into some very large and violent thunderstorms across India. These bring huge amounts of rainfall, and hence, the SW monsoon season is very much classed as the rainy season. The NE monsoon occurs at the opposite time of year, from December to February, when the ITCZ has gone to the South, now firmly within the Indian Ocean. This low pressure surface zone attracts the wind from all directions, meaning that much cooler, drier air flows over India from the North and North-East, then out towards the Indian Ocean. If you can picture the movement of the ITCZ throughout the year and know that air flowing from ocean to land brings rain, these questions become simple, and the Indian monsoon seasons are easy to work out every time. Of course the answer here is the SW monsoon, and the months that best fit it are July to August.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.08.02.04.06: Explain the formation of the SW/NE monsoon over India and describe the weather, stressing the seasonal differences. Note: This question is similar to 504956 - with some different options in more recent feedback. If future feedback shows they are the same question completely, they will be merged. This question is really tricky because of its options. The correct answer is the South-West Monsoon to our knowledge, as this is the standard name for that monsoon in the syllabus, however, that is the monsoon that occurs during Summer. Therefore, it is just a case of knowing the correct name of it in the syllabus. This is made even worse by the fact they mention the South-Easterly trade winds, which could confuse you further. We could use some extra feedback to confirm the wording on this question also, thank you. So for starters, by the question saying that the South-Easterly trade winds are blowing over India, it means that the ITCZ has travelled to the North of India, and therefore it is Northern Hemisphere Summer. The trade-winds actually stop blowing from the SE when they cross over to the Northern Hemisphere, and the Coriolis force (still quite weak near the Equator) begins to turn them to the right instead, so they actually arrive at India from the South-West. They do not change name though, we still call them the South-East trade winds as that's what they were originally, when they were in the Southern Hemisphere. The monsoon is the seasonal change in the wind in India. In the Winter, the NE Monsoon blows from the dry plains of the Siberian Peninsula, and in the Summer, the ITCZ goes North of India and the SW Monsoon takes over, the wind now coming from the hot, humid air from over the Indian Ocean, bringing very wet, often stormy weather.",

In December and July, when the sun is at its greatest extent north or south of the equator makes for two dry seasons. Further away from the equator, the two wet seasons merge into one, and the climate becomes more monsoonal, with one wet season and one dry season. In the Northern Hemisphere the wet season occurs from May to July, in the Southern Hemisphere from November to February.",

The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become SW monsoons. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of India, these SW monsoons bring humid maritime air. Conversely, during the winter months (December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the NE trade winds from the Northern Hemisphere need to cross the geographic Equator to reach the ITCZ. Upon entering the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the left, resulting in a change in their direction from NE to NW. Consequently, the Southern Hemisphere experiences NW monsoons, particularly in southern parts of Africa, while the Northern Hemisphere encounters NE monsoons in regions that previously experienced SW monsoons during the summer months (such as parts of Africa and India). Using India as an example, these NE monsoons bring dry continental air.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

            "explanation": "MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm. As we have seen above, the SW Monsoon occurs between June and August and the NE Monsoon occurs between December and February => the transition between these two occurs between September and November.",

This is because water has a much higher specific heat capacity than rock, so builds up and loses temperature much slower than land does (about 4x slower), and the oceans have some mixing which makes the effect even stronger. This means that the \"hottest\" part of the ocean does not move much between December and June, whereas the \"hottest\" part of the land moves a long way (following The Sun). This \"hottest\" part of the surface dictates the ITCZ in that area, the \"thermal equator\".",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (upwind side of the mountain, in this case, the south), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. With regards to this question, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds. The north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer => little or no precipitation is expected.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. In terms of weather, we can expect: • Upwind side: clouds, precipitation and poor visibility, • Downwind side: clear skies, good visibility, turbulence.",

Further information: MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air. Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating). This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles). Hoar frost can occur: on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack. in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases: If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer. If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion. The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. The best way to avoid ICI is laterally, by travelling more than the standard 20 nm away from the regions of high convective activity, and if possible, reducing the risk even further by travelling upwind of the area, so that the wind does not blow ice crystals into the path of the aircraft. This question asks further about whether to be above and below the tropopause to avoid the majority of the ice crystals. This is a little more difficult, as ice crystal icing events have occurred both above and below the tropopause in the past. It does look like most of the HIWC (High Ice Water Content - responsible for ICI) exists below the tropopause for the majority of storms, and those CBs that break through the tropopause do not seem to spread out the ice crystals very far from the cloud. See the annex for a visual representation of this. For this reason, an aircraft should remain above the tropopause to best avoid Ice Crystal Icing.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. The Freezing Process When a supercooled water droplet strikes an aircraft surface => it begins to freeze, releasing latent heat. This latent heat warms the remainder of the droplet to near 0°C, allowing the unfrozen part of the droplet to spread back across the surface until freez- ing is complete.",

Due to the intense downdrafts within each thunderstorm, the entire squall line is often led by a large \"gust front\", which feels like an immediate large change in wind velocity, as the wind is now blowing from the direction of the thunderstorm, where the downdrafts are getting spread out by the ground underneath. This gust front can sometimes form a roll cloud between the incoming air above and the outgoing downdraft air along the surface. An example of this is in the annexes above.

Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. The aircraft is most likely climbing after take off or approaching to land when passing through the inversion, which means that the airspeed is most probably slow - only a few knots greater than stall speed. The fluctuation in airspeed can induce a stall precariously close to the ground. Since surface wind is calm or very light, take off or landing can be in any direction. Takeoff may be in the direction of the wind above the inversion. If so, the aircraft encounters a sudden tailwind and a corresponding loss of airspeed when climbing through the inversion. Stall is possible. If approach is into the wind above the inversion, the headwind is suddenly lost when descending through the inversion. Again, a sudden loss in airspeed may induce a stall.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

The altitude at which the temperature reaches 0°C, known as the 0°C isotherm, is located at 6 000 ft. This indicates that the temperature at that altitude is at or slightly below freezing. Based on these specifics, it is probable that the most severe airframe icing, caused by freezing rain, would occur near or in the vicinity of the 0°C isotherm. This is because freezing rain has a higher likelihood of solidifying upon contact with the aircraft's surface when the temperature is freezing or slightly below. However, it is crucial to also consider the local QNH, as it can impact the altitude at which the aircraft encounters freezing rain. The local QNH, which represents atmospheric pressure, is measured at 994 hPa. Generally, a lower QNH corresponds to a lower altitude for a given flight level. Hence, if the QNH is low, the aircraft may encounter freezing rain at a lower altitude compared to a situation with a higher QNH.",

Rain remains in its liquid state. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice which is the most hazardous form of airframe icing - it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. - In a matter of seconds, freezing rain can coat an entire airplane, ruin lift, increase weight, block air filters, and render your windshield useless. The build-up of ice in flight, particularly in cloud and freezing rain, may be very rapid and aircrew should avoid icing conditions: When ice formation occurs on the leading edges of the aircraft wings and tail plane, the pattern of the airflow becomes modified round the affected part. This leads to an increase in drag, a decrease in lift, an increase in stalling speed (by as much as 30% in some cases), and perhaps to buffeting. Ice accretion on the leading edges of the fin and rudder and other moveable parts may interfere with the airflow to such an extent that control is seriously affected. => “Turn back” in this case means to turn around and exit the area of FZRA. By turning back you are taking the aircraft out of the band of rain ice which is typically found ahead of a warm front. \"He descends to the warm air layer below.\" Descending from 2 000 ft, hoping that the freezing level is far enough above the ground, will most likely put you in a risky situation. \"He ascends to the cold air layer above.\" A climb into cold air will not help you getting rid of ice. \"He continues to fly at the same altitude.\" Continuing will give a dangerous build up of rain ice.",

An inversion is a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere - where temperature increases with an increase in height. The rain falling from the Nimbostratus cloud at 7ºC, will be quite warm. However, in this situation, because of the temperature inversion, the temperature decreases as altitude reduces. Falling through cold air (between 5000 ft and 2000 ft), the droplets become supercooled. Freezing rain consists of raindrops that have become supercooled after falling from warmer air into air where the temperature is below zero => which happens between 5000 ft (+7ºC) and 2000 ft (-4ºC).

Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large, supercooled water droplets, and it can be very dangerous. There can be a lot of flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing. The ice will easily modify and destroy the shape of the aerofoil and its weight can cause problems with control, especially if the build-up is uneven. It is Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and because the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.

This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. With regards to this question, if we are flying towards a mountain range experiencing a tailwind => it is likely that we will encounter an updraft as we approach the mountain. On the other hand, when experiencing headwind, it means that the wind is blowing over the mountain and towards the aircraft => it it likely that we will encounter a down draft (a dangerous situation, especially if flying a low performance aircraft - we might not be able to overcome this downdraft). Alternatively, you can think of it this way: if you fly towards a mountain with tailwind, it means that the wind is also going towards the mountains, therefore, you are on the upwind of the mountain and not on the lee side (wind encounters the mountain from the same side as you). Flying towards a mountain with headwind, means that you are approaching the lee side of the mountain => where mountain waves occur and turbulence may be severe.",

If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions. Furthermore, as discussed above, Airborne Weather radar detects large droplet precipitation and hail (present in CBs), it does not detect stratus/stratocumulus or very small water droplets => making it relatively easy to identify embedded cumulonimbus.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur. Ice crystal icing (ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of very small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. These areas are perfect places for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes. Therefore, we can keep a good lookout for such clouds using our onboard weather radar, which readily picks up cumulonimbus clouds due to their large water content. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. This question calls them oceanic mesoscale convective systems, which simply means that the storms are full of moisture from the sea below, and are at least medium in size. Smaller convective systems would not be powerful enough to cause significant ice crystal icing. See the annex above for a visual representation of where HIWC (High Ice Water Content) can be found. These very small ice crystals are not found in cirrus clouds. The ice crystals which make up cirrus clouds are much larger, and actually less dangerous to fly through, especially as they can be easily seen.",

Ice crystal icing (ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance. In the case of this question, the first part of the route including the initial climb is completely clear of large convective active such as CBs. However, for the last hundreds of NM or so, the aircraft is cruising at FL370/FL490 completely within a region of OCNL EMBD CBs with tops of FL500. This area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.

Subsequently, these crystals detach and partially melt as they pass through the engine core. This process can lead to uncommanded thrust reduction and potentially cause engine damage. An indication that a significant encounter with ice crystal icing (ICI) is occurring is typically observed through a gradual decrease in engine rpm and a simultaneous increase in Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT). To mitigate the risk of encountering high concentrations of very small ice crystals, it is advisable to effectively utilize the aircraft weather radar.

The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence. Mountain waves can cause: Loss of Control. The vertical currents in the waves can make it difficult for an aircraft to maintain en route altitude leading to level busts and can cause significant fluctuations in airspeed potentially leading to loss of control. Loss of Control can also occur near to the ground prior to landing or after take off with a risk of terrain contact or a hard landing if crew corrective response to a downdraft is not prompt. Turbulence. Aircraft can suffer structural damage as a result of encountering severe clear air turbulence. In extreme cases this can lead to the break up of the aircraft. In even moderate turbulence, damage can occur to fittings within the aircraft especially as a result of collision with unrestrained items of cargo or passenger luggage.

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle. The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes. => This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. MATURE STAGE As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage. The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions. Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud) As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud. It can last up to 30 min => Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface). DISSIPATING STAGE As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape. => Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

The symptoms described (incorrect aerodynamic indications, engine shutdown, and burning smell) are consistent with a lightning strike on the aircraft, which can cause electrical malfunctions. Significant damage to the aircraft is rare. However, there is the potential for the transient airflow disturbance associated with lightning strike to cause engine shutdown. a) \"Volcanic ash\": Encountering volcanic ash can cause engine malfunctions and damage, but it would not typically result in incorrect aerodynamic indications or a burning smell in the cabin and flight deck. b) \"St. Elmo's fire\": St. Elmo's fire is a weather phenomenon in which electrical discharge occurs on objects with a high electrical charge, but it would not cause incorrect aerodynamic indications or engine shutdown. c) \"Hail\": Hail can cause damage to an aircraft's exterior, but it would not result in incorrect aerodynamic indications, engine shutdown, or a burning smell in the cabin and flight deck.",

The best information on turbulence is obtained from pilots’ Special Aircraft Observations. All pilots encountering turbulence are requested to report time, location, level, intensity and aircraft type to the ATS Unit with whom they are in radio contact. High level turbulence (normally above FL150 not associated with cumuliform cloud, including thunderstorms) should be reported as TURB, preceded by the appropriate intensity or preceded by Light or Moderate Chop. (Note: EASA still refer to clear air turbulence as CAT.) >Intensity: LIGHT Aircraft Reaction (transport size aircraft): Turbulence that momentarily causes slight, erratic changes in altitude and/or attitude (pitch, roll, yaw). IAS fluctuates 5 - 15 kt. (<0.5 g at the aircraft’s center of gravity) Report as ‘Light Turbulence’. Turbulence that causes slight, rapid and somewhat rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude. No IAS fluctuations. Report as ‘Light Chop’. Reaction Inside Aircraft: Occupants may feel a slight strain against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects may be displaced slightly. Food service may be conducted and little or no difficulty is encountered in walking. >Intensity: MODERATE Aircraft Reaction (transport size aircraft): Turbulence that is similar to light Turbulence but of greater intensity. Changes in altitude and/or attitude occur but the aircraft remains in positive control at all times. IAS fluctuates 15 - 25 kt. (0.5 - 1.0 g at the aircraft’s center of gravity). Report as ‘Moderate Turbulence’. Turbulence that is similar to Light Chop but of greater intensity. It causes rapid bumps or jolts without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude. IAS may fluctuate slightly. Report as ‘Moderate Chop’. Reaction Inside Aircraft: Occupants feel definite strains against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects are dislodged. Food service and walking are difficult. >Intensity: SEVERE Aircraft Reaction (transport size aircraft): Turbulence that causes large, abrupt changes in altitude and/or attitude. Aircraft may be momentarily out of control. IAS fluctuates more than 25 kt. (>1.0 g at the aircraft’s center of gravity). Report as ‘Severe Turbulence’. Reaction Inside Aircraft: Occupants are forced violently against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects are tossed about. Food service and walking impossible. Note 1: Pilots should report location(s), time(s) (UTC), incidence, intensity, whether in or near clouds, altitude(s) and type of aircraft. All locations should be readily identifiable. Turbulence reports should be made when moderate/severe turbulence is encountered, or on request. Note 2: \"The turbulence is of a small scale\" refers to turbulence generated by \"small-scale\" wind velocity gradients around the jet stream, typically occurring within hundreds of meters or less. This turbulence occurs when rapidly moving air encounters much slower air in close proximity.",

            "explanation": "Structural Icing It builds up on any exposed surface of an aircraft, causing loss of lift, an increase in weight, and control problems. There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear. TEMPERATURE RANGE TYPE OF ICING RIME ICE (Small supercooled water droplets Stratiform clouds) 0ºC TO -15ºC -15ºC TO -30ºC Expect moderate icing Expect light icing CLEAR ICE (Large supercooled water droplets Cumuliform clouds) 0ºC TO -15ºC May be found in CB’s at -25ºC Expect severe icing",

Where the temperature increases with an increase in height, then we have what is called an inversion: vertical mixing is inhibited and below an inversion the wind speed will be light with a significantly different direction to the much stronger wind above the inversion. Hence windshear will occur at the inversion. An aircraft climbing or descending through the inversion will experience a rapid change in speed and direction giving, possibly, moderate to severe turbulence.

Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing. The ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is 1. Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.

Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude. Strong inversions are known to happen in desert areas, such as Saudi Arabia, where the surface will heat up quickly during the day and cool off rapidly at night. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. - Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind => which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in Rate of Climb. The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground. - Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreases aircrafts performance leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air - which reduces the aircraft's rate of climb.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur. Ice crystal icing (ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance. In the case of this question, the first part of the route including the initial climb is completely clear of large convective active such as CBs. However, for the last hundreds of NM or so, the aircraft is cruising at FL450 completely within a region of ISOL EMBD CBs with tops of FL480. This area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.",

This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning.

Wings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils. There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. ⇒ Therefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

The only way to answer this question is to go through each answer, by process of elimination, so that is what we shall do. \"(1) lightning; (4) gust front; (3) windshear.\" Firstly, point 1 on the image is of the edge of the anvil, which is just spreading out air at high altitude, and therefore is unlikely to contain the violent up/downdraughts that cause lightning. Point 4 is the area under the anvil, where hail and strong winds could be expected, but not much else. 3 would certainly contain windshear, being the core of the CB \"(3) severe windshear; (5) windshear.\" This is correct. Point 3 is the core of the CB so extremely severe windshear can be expected, and point 5 is just below the CB, where updraughts and downdrafts of considerable strength are still occurring in close proximity to each other, causing plenty of windshear. A microburst could also be expected in this region. \"(5) lightning; (3) gust front; (1) windshear.\" Point 5 could experience some lightning through the region, from the cloud to the ground (or vice-versa), but point 3 is the core of the storm, not the gust front. A little windshear could be expected at point 1, but not very much. \"(3) no wind; (5) windshear; (1) lightning.\" Point 3 is likely to have plenty of wind, discounting this option already. 5 will have windshear, but 1 is unlikely to have lightning.",

Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle. The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes. => This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. MATURE STAGE As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage. The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions. Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud) As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud. It can last up to 30 min => Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface). DISSIPATING STAGE As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape. => Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance. Normal thunderstorm avoidance procedures may help pilots avoid regions of high ice crystal content. These avoidance procedures include: Avoiding flying in visible moisture over storm cells. Visible moisture at high altitude must be considered a threat since intense storm cells may produce high concentrations of ice crystals at cruise altitude. Flying upwind of storms when possible. Using the radar antenna tilt function to scan the reflectivity of storms ahead. Assess the height of the storms. Recognize that heavy rain below the freezing level typically indicates high concentrations of ice crystals above. Avoiding storm reflectivity by 20 nautical miles has been commonly used as a recommended distance from convection. This may not be sufficient for avoidance of high concentrations of ice crystals, as they are not visible on airborne radar.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning. Types of lightning: Intra-Cloud lightning: The most common type of lightning. It happens inside the cloud, jumping between different charge regions in the cloud. It lights up the cloud. Cloud-to-air lightning: Referring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud. Cloud-to-cloud lightning: Happens when a negatively charged cloud finds a positively charged cloud and opposites attract. The discharge travels from cloud to cloud. Cloud-to-ground lightning: Flows from the cloud to the ground. Often has downward \"branches\" or \"forks\" which come off at angles and discharge into the surrounding air. Ground-to-cloud lightning: Also known as upward lightning, and has the opposite direction of charge from the cloud-to-ground lightning above. The lightning flows upwards, and may have a few small upwards branches, but is mostly made up of just one path. This image is good enough to see that the lightning is cloud-to-air, as it comes out of the cloud in the very bright region, and the forks spread out and disappear into the air, not going into any other clouds.",

Consequently, air pollutants, smoke, and dust aren't able to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere. This accumulation of particulates can cause reduced visibility below the inversion. With regards to this question, as we have discussed, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => Thrust and lift will decrease as the aircraft climbs into warmer and less dense air. Air pollutants, smoke, and dust will not disperse vertically, instead they are trapped below the inversion - resulting in a deteriorated visibility => Therefore, visibility improves above the inversion.",

The katabatic eﬀect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. In valleys, inversions are also called cold-air pools and form as a result of both cooling of the ground due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds (Katabatic winds). The colder air which flows down the valley walls may “collect” at the bottom of the valley, creating a cold pool of air near the surface and low temperatures on the ground. They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale => Because the dense air is not able to rise and disperse, near-ground air pollution, haze, and possibly even fog, visibility inside the cold valley pool is generally not very good.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.09.01.04.03: Identify weather situations and their relevant areas where high concentrations of ice crystals are likely to occur. Ice crystal icing (ICI) condition refers to aircraft experiencing icing inflight in high altitude due to high concentration of small ice crystals. At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather far above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystals, mostly invisible to the human eye, and to weather radars. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance. In the case of this question, the first 1000-1500 NM are completely clear of large convective active such as CBs, but after this, the aircraft is cruising at FL490 completely within a region of ISOL EMBD CBs with tops of FL470, and goes through regions of OCNL EMBD CBs with tops of FL500. This area would be a perfect place for ICI to occur, in and above the tops of huge convective clouds with plenty of moisture carried up to the high altitudes.",

A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – Initial/Developing stage, Mature stage and Dissipating stage. INITIAL/DEVELOPING STAGE Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle. The cloud will reach the mature stage in about 15-20 minutes. => This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. The cloud is a towering cumulus during this stage MATURE STAGE As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage. The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions. Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud) As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud. It can last up to 30 minutes (in a single cell). => Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface). DISSIPATING STAGE As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape. => Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air. Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating). This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles). Hoar frost is not as dangerous as clear ice but may affect the lift characteristics of the wings. If frost is not removed from the wings, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack.",

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

Usually, tornadoes only really extend from supercell thunderstorms, which are particularly common on the plains of the USA, East of the Rocky Mountains, where warm tropical air from the Caribbean and Mexico region meets cold polar air coming down from Canada. The annex above shows the amount of tornadoes in the USA per year. As you can see, it is usually above 1000, with an average of about 1200, and that is only in the USA, not including Canada, Mexico and the other Central American countries that are classed as North America, so the total for the continent will certainly be higher than these figures.

Speeds average 10 kt and the ﬂow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form. In valleys, inversions are also called cold-air pools and form as a result of both cooling of the ground due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds (Katabatic winds). The colder air which flows down the valley walls may “collect” at the bottom of the valley, creating a cold pool of air near the surface and low temperatures on the ground. They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale",

Please let us know if you see this in the exam, and anything you can remember about it, thank you! A squall line is a narrow band of active thunderstorms that normally contains very severe weather. Although it often forms 50 to 200 miles ahead of a fast-moving cold front, the existence of a front is not necessary for a squall line to form. Obviously, with so many thunderstorms, the weather around a squall line can be very bad. This includes widespread turbulence, of course moderate to severe inside the clouds themselves, but also some intense clear air turbulence (CAT) around, above, and underneath the squall line. Squall lines should be avoided by an even larger margin than isolated CBs. As for the other answers: In a cold occlusion, there is usually turbulence within the clouds and precipitation, but not always clear air turbulence around (it very much depends on the altitude you fly through it, and the conditions of the day), whereas squall lines always contain many CBs so definitely do provide some CAT. A warm high would be a stable portion of air, so unlikely to provide much turbulence at all. With calm winds (no sea breeze, etc), a coastline could cause some turbulence due to changing thermals between land and sea, but it wouldn't usually be much, and certainly not as much as around a squall line.",

            "explanation": "Airframe icing is a huge hazard to flight. In icing conditions, pilots have to be very careful. Not only does ice accretion add weight and drag to an aircraft, it also changes the shape of the wing, reducing the finely tuned lift characteristics. It can also block probes and ice over ports or vanes. Airframe icing happens primarily whilst flying in an area with an air temperature just below 0ºC, and therefore with an airframe below freezing temperature. Clouds can often contain droplets of water that are below freezing temperature (0ºC), but are still in liquid form. These are called Super-Cooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). As soon as SCWDs hit a freezing airframe, they will freeze onto it. This freezing can take place a bit differently depending on the droplet size and temperature. If the droplets are large, and quite close to the freezing point, then they will release enough latent heat as they freeze, that the rest of the droplet will drip backwards over the wing and form clear ice. This is usually regarded as the most dangerous type of ice. The freezing can also happen immediately (particularly for smaller droplets at lower temperatures), and they form a white build-up on the leading edge of the wings and other surfaces, called rime ice. The worst icing happens just below 0ºC, and icing can occur down to temperatures as cold as -45ºC, but it is a gradual drop off, and you would not expect any significantly dangerous ice below -23ºC. The SCWDs rarely get much colder than this before freezing in the cloud. Convective clouds such as CBs are the worst for icing, as they can hold large droplets using their strong updrafts, and have wild temperature changes allowing large SCWDs into colder sections where an airframe would be very prone to icing. Nimbostratus clouds can also hold medium sized droplets and produce moderate icing. Inside a CB cloud, the worst icing is going to be just above the freezing level, which is usually around the middle of the cloud. At the bottom of the cloud, the temperature is above freezing, and at the top of the cloud, it is mostly just ice crystals and hail that has been thrown up there.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque/milky granular appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles). Hoar frost can occur: on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack. in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases: If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer. If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion.

This process is associated with the development of moderate to severe icing conditions, with greater icing observed over ridges than valleys and on the windward side compared to the leeward side. In this particular situation, stable cold air is compelled to ascend the west slope of the mountain, resulting in the formation of a stratiform cloud just below the mountain top, and the freezing layer positioned at the mountain's peak. The highest risk of icing occurs above the freezing layer (zero-degree isotherm), where there is a high concentration of water droplets on the western side of the mountain due to the forced condensation of rising air.

            "explanation": "Aircraft icing can be divided into two general types based on whether it affects power production or aerodynamics. Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the outside air temperature is between -10ºC and +30ºC and with a high relative humidity. Carburettor icing is particularly common, as the air cools down significantly inside the carburettor, not only due to the decreased static pressure in the venturi section (decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air. It is worse when the throttle is low, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect. As you can see by the graph above, the worst icing happens between about -1ºC and +15°C, which is very close to the correct answer given here. Too warm, and the air won't cool down enough in the carburettor to form ice. Too cold, and there isn't usually enough water vapour in the air to develop carburettor icing.",

            "explanation": "There are a few different types of ice that can form on an aircraft in flight. The two most common are rime ice and clear ice. RIME ICE Rime ice is an opaque, cloudy type of ice build up that usually accretes on leading edges, such as the aircraft nose, wing/tail leading edges, etc. It is opaque due to the air trapped inside the ice; this makes it very difficult to see through. It is normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. CLEAR ICE As you can expect from the name, clear ice is a transparent, layered form of icing, which usually runs backwards over the airframe or the wing. It is more dangerous than rime ice as it affects the aerodynamic shape of the wing more, and allows a larger ice build up, which adds weight and drag. It can also run backwards over control surfaces, freezing them in place. Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice would be much easier to see through if accreted on a windshield than the cloudy rime ice. The other types of icing that can be encountered in flight are mixed ice (a mixture of rime and clear ice) and ice crystal icing (a much rarer formation inside engines and pitot tubes from tiny ice crystals above large storms - looks like rain on a heated windshield - bounces off unheated surfaces)",

This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning. The main effects of a lightning strike are: Temporary blindness of the pilots Minor airframe damage Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked Disruption to electrical equipment",
