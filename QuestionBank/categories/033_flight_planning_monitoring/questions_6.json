This chart observes two different flight paths; CDFA (solid line) and non-CDFA (dashed). In addition, the missed approach point is indicated on the chart for both approach types. When in doubt when approaching using the overlay method, rely on conventional methods. The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GNSS equipment to fly existing, conventional STAR procedures, without replacing it. It follows the same route as the conventional procedure, with waypoints defined by coordinates instead of bearings and distances from ground navigation aids. In most cases, each ground navigation aid or intersection point of the conventional STAR, corresponds to an RNAV waypoint. Additionally, some RNAV waypoints (Fly-by or Fly-over) may be added, non-existing in the conventional STAR, to facilitate the turns. An RNAV STAR overlay may be either shorter or longer in distance than an RNAV STAR, depending on the design.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 3 300 ft (MOCA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (27/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of approx. 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-7ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -22ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 300 ft - 27 ft = 3 273 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (3 273/1 000) = 288 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 3 588 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 210 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3 588 ft - 210 ft = 3 378 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south magnetic track of 182º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL40. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 000 ft (MSA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-25ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -20ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (8 000/1000) = -640 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 640 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 621 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 640 ft + 621 ft = 9 261 ft. The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL100. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft is flying at 3 300 ft. This altitude is the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (179/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature at the aerodrome elevation of approx. 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+8ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -7ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -7ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 300 ft - 179 ft = 3 121 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-7) × (3 121/1 000) = 87 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of 3 387 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 3 387 ft + 660 ft = 4 047 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south magnetic track of 182º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL60.",

In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings. The conventional Standard Instrument Departure procedures (SIDs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV SIDs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates. The FMS takes navigational inputs from GPS, IRS and ground navigational aids. If GPS signal is lost, then IRS and ground navigational aids still work, as a back-up option. Thus, the aircraft's GPS receiver must be always available for the RNAV SID procedure and the others are required in case of problem with the GNSS. Obviously, the aircraft's VOR and DME receivers must be serviceable, since the DKB4H RNAV SID procedure uses the ground navigational aids STG and DKB VOR/DMEs for guidance, which must be serviceable too.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa difference. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­210 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 35 000 + 210 = 35 210 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × 20× (34090/1000) = 2 727 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­­32 483ft. This gives a difference in values of 35000 - 32483 = 2517 RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 15 500 ft (13 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 15 500 ft - 8 000 ft = 7 500 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (7 500/1 000) = -450 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 15 950 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 950 ft - 510 ft = 15 440 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

When appropriate, other aircraft operating in the vicinity of the aircraft in an emergency should be advised of the circumstances. As stated in ICAO Document 4444, ATC will clear us to the most direct route with minimum maneuvering to reduce the workload on us. Although the BESOR and ALTET both seem appropriate, a second instruction after the BESOR point means an extra workload for the flight crew. Therefore, the most acceptable standard arrival route that ATC can give us to approach runway 10 is GERVU 1L. In this case, ATC can either clear us to execute GERVU 1L or clear us directly to ALTET.

It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a Radial 090o from the Aberdeen (ADN) VOR/DME. The radial crosses two radar minimum altitude areas, whose minimum altitudes are 1700 ft and 2000 ft. Therefore, flying inbound ABERDEEN VOR/DME (ADN) on Radial 090o, an aircraft initially passes MRVA 2000 ft and as approaching to the Aberdeen VOR/DME it passes MRVA 1700 ft.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 975 hPa = 38 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 38 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 140 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 7 000 ft - 1 140 ft = 5 860 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-20ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (5 860/1000) = -352 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 5 860 ft - 352 ft = ­­­­­5 508 ft. Closest answer: 5 510 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (8 230/1 000) = -593 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 8 823 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 540 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 823 ft + 540 ft = 9 363 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 123º (M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL110. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (28 500/1 000) = - 1 710 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­30 210 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 30 210 ft + 300 ft = 30 510 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M).

There are a few ways of ensuring a safe altitude to fly at whilst IFR. Around an aerodrome, you can use the MSA which goes out to 25nm from the aerodrome or a nearby nav-aid. These are documented on aerodrome charts. On a pre-determined route, you can use the MEA (minimum en-route altitude) or the MOCA (minimum obstacle/obstruction clearance altitude), which are slightly different, but both provide sufficient terrain clearance (usually 5 nm either side of the route) When close to a route, you can use that route's MORA (minimum off route altitude) which Jeppesen provide out to 10 nm from the route (useful for avoidance, offsets, etc.). Off a planned route completely, you can use the grid MORA from the en-route charts, which gives sufficient obstacle clearance with everything in that grid box (which is one segment of the latitude/longitude grid of the chart. All these give roughly the same obstacle clearance. Minimum 1000 ft everywhere, and minimum 2000 ft in \"mountainous areas\" where the terrain is higher than 5000 ft. There are small changes with some of them and in different countries, but this rule usually works for all the exam questions we currently know about.",

Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS), where ground stations directly relay integrity data to the aircraft. Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), where the integrity data is relayed through a satellite link. Because satellites are monitored from the ground, it may take some considerable time before users become aware of a malfunction in the system. At present, two methods exist within airborne equipment to provide integrity of navigation under these circumstances: Using a system called Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). To combine satellite positioning with more conventional navigation systems to create a multi-sensor navigation system using inputs such as barometric altitude and time. It is important before flight to check that there will be enough satellites visible for an accurate position at all stages of the flight. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the notice advisory to NANU messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure they are available for the time of usage. Augmentation such as GBAS, SBAS and RAIM check for errors and correct them and/or notify the flight deck. Non-augmented GNSS simply use the satellites in sight and positioning. Timing errors or the loss of a satellite signal are not notified to the flight deck nor is the error in the position a solution. Therefore, the availability of the relevant satellites and any potential outages must be checked before flight.",

Basic Area Navigation (B-RNAV) or RNAV 5 (in Europe) was introduced to enable en-route capacity gains to be achieved with minimal aircraft capability. B-RNAV is defined as RNAV that meets a track keeping accuracy equal to or better than +/-5 NM for 95% of the flight time. This value includes signal source error, airborne receiver error, display system error, and flight technical error. BRNAV can be achieved using inputs from: DME/DME, VOR/DME, INS or IRS and GPS. The GERVU 1M requires B-RNAV equipment and it represents an RNAV overlay, and the waypoints can still be navigated with ground aids reference (BRNAV). Note: If GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would be explicitly labeled as \"RNAV,\" and there would be no radials or distances specified for the RNAV waypoints.",

However, where airspace requirements are critical, procedures may be restricted to lower speed categories. 1.3.9 Alternatively, the procedure may specify a maximum IAS for a particular segment without reference to aircraft category. In any case, it is essential that pilots comply with the procedures and information depicted on instrument flight charts and the appropriate flight parameters (.) if the aircraft is to remain in the areas developed for obstacle clearance purposes. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given bank angle is directly proportional to the square of the airspeed. Which means that doubling the airspeed results in a radius of turn that is four times greater RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a SW Radial 225o from the Aberdeen airport. The radial crosses four radar minimum altitude areas, whose minimum altitudes are 4100 ft, 3200 ft, 2800 ft and 2300 ft respectively. Therefore, flying inbound ABERDEEN airport on Radial 225o, an aircraft initially passes MRVA 4100 ft and 3200 ft as approaching to the Aberdeen VOR/DME it passes MRVA 2800 ft and MRVA 2300 ft.

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 27 360 ft + 300 ft = 27 660 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: RVSM airspace - FL290 to FL410.",

Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­390 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 17 000 ft - 390 ft = 16 610 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL170). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (17 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-19 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-29 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 610 ft - 13 500 ft = 3 110 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (3 110/1000) = 124 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 16 610 ft - 124 ft = ­­­­­16 486 ft. The charted minimum grid altitude 16 200 ft in a mountainous terrain means that, an aircraft flying within this grid clears the highest obstacle by 2 000 ft. Thus, the highest obstacle is at: 16 200 ft - 2 000 ft = 14 200 ft. Therefore, the aircraft clears the obstacle by: 16 486 ft - 14 200 ft = 2 286 ft. RULES.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 690 ft = 4 310 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 4 310 ft - 1 000 ft = 3 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (3 310/1000) = 132 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 4 310 ft + 132 ft = 4 442 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Note.— Bank angle limits for different aircraft types and winds aloft are taken into account in procedure design. 5.2.2 The other form of the FRP is intended to be used with en-route procedures. Due to the technicalities of how the procedure data are defined, it falls upon the RNP system to create the fixed radius turn (also called a fixed radius transition or FRT) between two route segments ( 5.2.3 These turns have two possible radii, 22.5 NM for high altitude routes (above FL 195) and 15 NM for low altitude routes.

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 7 600 ft - 178 ft = 7 422 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (7 422/1 000) = -505 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 7 600 ft + 505 ft = 8 105 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 986 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 810 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 105 ft + 810 ft = 8 915 ft. The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 200 kt. Mark the wind velocity 50 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 191º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 186º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 191º. This occurs at a heading of 196º with 6ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 244 kt. Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind.

A fly-over waypoint is as it says, the aircraft has to actually pass overhead the waypoint before taking up the course for the next leg. A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation. This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn. A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot. The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differentiated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints. According to the route description at the bottom section of the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) 10-3Q chart, all aircraft, apart from B737, must fly overhead EHØ48. Therefore, for all aircraft other than B737, the EHØ48 RNAV waypoint is fly-by. But for B737 aircraft EHØ8Ø RNAV waypoint is a fly-over one.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 210 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 8 000 ft + 210 ft = 8 210 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 210 ft - 300 ft = 7 910 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (7 910/1000) = -475 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 210 ft - 475 ft = ­­­­­7 735 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­360 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 3 500 ft + 360 ft = 3 860 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 860 ft - 1 416 ft = 2 444 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (2 444/1000) = 117 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 860 ft - 117 ft = 3 743 ft. Thus, the true height of the aircraft above the airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 3 743 ft - 1 416 ft = 2 327 ft, which is very close to 2 330 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 265º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1040 hPa - 1013 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­810 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 8 000 ft + 810 ft = 8 810 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 810 ft - 2 500 ft = 6 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (6 310/1000) = - 505 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 810 ft - 505 ft = 8 305 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 8168 4.3 TEMPERATURE CORRECTION 4.3.1 Requirement for temperature correction The calculated minimum safe altitudes/heights must be adjusted when the ambient temperature on the surface is much lower than that predicted by the standard atmosphere. In such conditions, an approximate correction is 4 per cent height increase for every 10°C below standard temperature as measured at the altimeter setting source. This is safe for all altimeter setting source altitudes for temperatures above –15°C. Even if the baromeric settings on the altimeter are correct, the true altitude will differ from the indicated altitude, if the temperature differs from the ISA values. The altimeter is calibrated to ISA. If the temperature differs from ISA, the QNH will only read the correct altitude on the ground. If you are airborne, you may need to apply a temperature correction to get the true altitude. In warm conditions (higher than ISA), this is not dangerous, because the trues altitude will be higher than the indicated (safe error). However, in very cold air (lower than ISA), and close to the ground, the temperature error may be critical as the true altitude will be less than the indicated altitude (dangerous error). An easy way to remember this is that, when the temperature is LOW, the aircraft will be LOWER than indicated. There are also two mnemonics that may be used to remember these effects: High - Low - High, which means that, if you fly from high to low, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read high. Low - High - Low, which means that, if you fly from low to high, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read low. And there is also an other one mnemonic to decide which effect requires attention: High to Low - Careful Go: which implies that, if you are going from either high temperature or pressure to lower, then you are closer to the ground than you expect. It is essential, therefore, to make an altimeter temperature error correction when calculating minimum descent heights in very cold conditions. The amount to add on to the indicated height or altitude to get the true value, is usually derived from correction tables. Therefore, in very cold conditions (colder than ISA), a temperature correction must added to the decision height (DH), MDH or MDA.",

Around an aerodrome, you can use the MSA (minimum sector altitude) which goes out to 25nm from the aerodrome or a nearby nav-aid. These are documented on aerodrome charts. On a pre-determined route, you can use the MEA (minimum en-route altitude) or the MOCA (minimum obstacle/obstruction clearance altitude), which are slightly different, but both provide sufficient terrain clearance (usually 5 nm either side of the route) When close to a route, you can use that route's MORA (minimum off route altitude) which Jeppesen provide out to 10 nm from the route (useful for avoidance, offsets, etc.). Not enough for a 50 nm diversion away from the route. Off a planned route completely, you can use the grid MORA from the en-route charts, which gives sufficient obstacle clearance with everything in that grid box. All these give roughly the same obstacle clearance. Minimum 1000 ft everywhere, and minimum 2000 ft in \"mountainous areas\" where the terrain is higher than 5000 ft.

To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn pressure altitude into indicated altitude. The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 = 31 hPa less than standard pressure. Because we are in low pressure, our indicated altitude is lower than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 = 930 ft lower than the pressure altitude. Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 = 28,070 ft To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate. ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C. As our temperature is lower than ISA, our true altitude will be even lower than our indicated altitude. Temperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet). In this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)1909 ft Therefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 = 26,161 ft This makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 = 701 ft, closest answer 680 ft Note: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 590 ft and 690 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 27 360 ft + 300 ft = 27 660 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL290. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 500 ft (MSA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (8 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-20ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -18ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. For the temperature correction, the elevation of the airfield must be taken into account: 8 500 ft - 4 000 ft = 4 500 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (4 500/1000) = -324 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 824 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 824 ft + 300 ft = 9 124 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1010 hPa = 3 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 3 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­90 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 20 000 ft - 90 ft = 19 910 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 19 910 ft - 1 000 ft = 18 910 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (18 910/1000) = 756 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 19 910 ft + 756 ft = ­­­­­20 666 ft. Rounded to 100 ft = 20 700 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings. The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. Aircraft equipped with RNAV systems, which have been approved by the State of the Operator for the appropriate level of RNAV operations, may use these systems to carry out VOR/DME RNAV approaches and departures. An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GPS equipment to fly existing, conventional instrument STAR procedures. However, many of these overlays may not accurately reflect the correct STAR procedure and may even represent a different speed category of aircraft. The normal equipment for that RNAV STAR must always be used as the primary reference – and not the GPS - as it allows for efficient sequencing of the traffic flow, thus reducing the workload of the ATC. Otherwise, any disparity between the displays and the potential for mistakes are just as likely to diminish the safety margins.",

A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation. This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn. A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot. The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differenciated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 7 880 ft (5 880 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 7 880 ft - 2 075 ft = 5 805 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (5 805/1 000) = -418 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 8 298 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 298 ft + 300 ft = 8 598 ft. The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Initially, set the True Track to 191º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 6ºL drift and a track of 185º.

Therefore, it is vital to ensure that the information input into the system is correct, especially when rerouting. The Flight Management Computer (FMC) restricts the input of a cruising altitude that is not achievable based on the aircraft's weight and the prevailing temperature conditions. However, while in cruise, the FMC continuously recalculates the aircraft's performance data based on the air data and weight to determine if a climb to a higher altitude is feasible. Entering an incorrect cruise level into the FMC can have significant consequences. The FMC uses the entered cruise level to calculate various parameters, including speeds, times, and fuel flows. If the cruise level is incorrect, these calculations will be based on inaccurate information. This can lead to incorrect flight performance predictions and affect the efficiency and accuracy of the aircraft's operation.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question is incorrect in the official exam and should be challenged or appealed!! The correct option should be FL130 instead of FL110. It seems that EASA is applying the temperature correction as if the meteorological station is located at the top of the obstacle. In reality, the temperature correction should only be applied to the required obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft if the meteo station is explicitly stated to be at the top of the mountain, which is not the case. Our explanation provides the correct method for solving this question. Unfortunately, you may need to remember the correct option and challenge it if you encounter this question in your official exam. As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct or not. Authority Reported Answer Portugal, ANAC FL130 UK CAA FL130 Czech Republic not FL130 Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 10 400 ft (8 400 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 400/1000) = -624 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­11 025 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1005 hPa = 8 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 8 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 240 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 025 ft + 240 ft = 11 265 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 140º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL130. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

A fly-by waypoint is one where the pilot is required to use turn anticipation to avoid overshoot of the next flight segment. It allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead. A fly-over waypoint, as it says, requires the aircraft to actually fly overhead the waypoint. It precludes any turn until the waypoint is overflown, and is followed by an intercept maneuver of the next flight segment. The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differenciated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints.",

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. There is no need to calculate the pressure correction. The standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa does not require any pressure correction. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level in RVSM airspace, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: RVSM airspace - FL290 to FL410.",

The conventional Standard Instrument Departure procedures (SIDs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV SIDs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates. The FMS takes navigational inputs from GPS, IRS and ground navigational aids.

The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 5 460 ft - 2 430 ft = 3 030 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (3 030/1000) = 182 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 5 460 ft - 182 ft = 5 278 ft. Thus, the height of the aircraft above airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 5 278 ft - 4 870 ft = 480 ft, thus obstacle clearance can be ensured. RULES.

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question).

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC.

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (28 500/1 000) = -1 140ft.

Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 29 640 ft + 300 ft = 29 940 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL310. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.

Learning Objectives 033.02.01.02: Courses and distances from en-route charts 033.02.01.02.02: Determine bearings and distances of waypoints from radio-navigation aids. Using the chart, identify the aircraft's position using the coordinate grid. A good method for accuracy is to draw a horizontal and vertical line along the exact latitude and longitude: the location is where they cross. Then draw lines from MCT and TNT VORs. The radials from these VORs need to be magnetic, so you can either measure the true radial with a protractor lined up against North (then apply the local variation), or you can line the protractor up with the directions of the airways outbound from the VORs. The true radials outbound from the VORs are MCT: 063º(T), TNT: 022º(T) Applying the local magnetic variation of 2ºW to both of these (Variation West, Magnetic Best) gives magnetic radials of: MCT: 065º(M), radial 065. TNT: 024º(M), radial 024.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 27 700 ft (25 700 ft + 2000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +20°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+20) × (27 700/1000) = 2216 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­25 484 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1033 hPa - 1013 hPa = 20 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 25 484 ft - 600 ft = 24 884 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240°(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: This question is trying to trick you. Do not forget that RVSM airspace is between FL290 to FL410. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Aside airways G850, W810 and W820, \"2\" indicates the Conditional Route Category, according to which these airways are plannable and can be used only during times designated in the Conditional Route Availability Message (CRAM), published at 1500 for the 24 hour period starting at 0600 the next day. Flights on a CDR 2 ATS route can only be planned when the CDRs are made available through NOTAM, which will notify the vertical limits and duration of availability of the CDR. Whenever an operator plans to use the CDR2 or is required by the Civil ATS unit to use this CDR2, an individual flight plan shall be submitted. In this case, the flight plan should contain in Item 15 the CDR2 to be followed. Under this circumstance, any associated RPL shall be cancelled. Therefore, the ATS route VLC - A34 - ALT - D - AMR, may be not the shortest and most direst route, in comparison with the shortest one (VLC - G850 - AMR), but it is the best route that can be used at all times.",

This is the closest available learning objective to this question, and even though none of the given options actually refer directly to the learning objective itself, it does give valuable guidance on which options to reject. All modern transport aircraft will have Flight Management Computers (FMCs) fitted. Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations. The normal calculation method is for the FMC to use actual wind to the next waypoint and pilot-inputted forecast winds beyond that. The actual wind is calculated using FMS position and groundspeed, heading (provided by the IRS or AHRS), and TAS (provided by the Air Data Computer, which is an outside input). The GNSS/FMC combination is not able to detect weather (that is down to the weather radar), nor does it ask for fewer data from the air data computer, as all the ADC data is still put to use within various onboard systems. Also, a route check before each flight is still essential, to check that the route has been inputted correctly by the pilot. There is no automatic route check, the FMC will happily fly any wrong route just as well as a correct one. ETA is continuously updated using real-time GNSS data, which provides real-time positioning data that includes information about the aircraft's ground speed and track, enabling pilots to have accurate time-of-arrival estimates throughout the flight. Also when integrated with onboard weather systems or data from air traffic control, GNSS enables pilots to continuously monitor and account for actual wind conditions affecting the aircraft's flight path. Note: The feedback on this question is mixed; the question is believed to be almost exactly correct, but the options are not as precise. Any exam feedback on this question would therefore be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. Be sure to remember as much as you can of the above learning objective, so if you do get this question in your exam (it is quite common) and the options are not the same as we have here, you can choose the correct one more easily.",

Standard Instrument Departure (SID) is a designated IFR departure route linking the aerodrome or a specified runway of the aerodrome with a specified significant point, normally on a designated ATS route, at which the en-route phase of a flight commences. RNAV SID is the design of an RNAV or RNP procedure that follows the path over the ground of the nominal track of the existing conventional procedure as closely as possible, i.e. it is the path over the ground of the designed conventional procedure. An RNAV SID overlay basically overlays a conventional SID procedure by creating RNAV waypoints at significant points so that the procedure is followed by the FMS by following the same track.",

            "explanation": "When doing an approach in cold conditions, a temperature error correction must be applied since your aircraft will be lower than the indicated altitude. This is very dangerous, as it reduces vertical separation between your aircraft and obstacles. In warm conditions (>ISA), this is not as much of an issue since your aircraft will be at a higher altitude than the one indicated and you will have greater vertical separation from obstacles. A good mnemonic to remember is \"high to low lookout below\". This mnemonic works for both temperature and pressure. If your aircraft is going from a high temperature/pressure area to a low temperature/pressure area, your altimeter will show you an indication that is higher than your true altitude. This means that you will be lower than desired, your vertical separation will be reduced and hence you must \"lookout below\". In cold conditions, you must add a temperature error correction to the DH, MDH or MDA. Temperature error corrections are usually not applied to small deviations from ISA since the difference in altitude would be negligible. The answer \"colder than -10°C\" is the only one that gives a temperature below which you should always apply a temperature correction. For the answers including \"between\", you would not stop applying the temperature correction below -10°C or -15°C. You would keep applying the correction even if it gets colder.",

Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082oT. Variation is 001oW, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082oT+ 1o = 083o M(Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM. Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 12 100 ft (10 600 ft + 1 500 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (12 100/1 000) = -726 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 12 826 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1035 hPa - 1013 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 12 826 ft - 660 ft = 12 166 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 215º (M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL140. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

A decision altitude (DA) minimum procedure is used. There are several types of RNP APCH with 3D vertical guidance, and they differ in the way in which they source their vertical guidance information. RNP APCH introduced new types of 3D operations, making use of certified Baro-VNAV systems or the SBAS geometric positioning (RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV and to LPV respectively); GNSS + VNAV is a PBN 3D approach: GNSS nav in the horizontal plane and barometric inputs for the vertical plane; SBAS with vertical guidance (LPV): supported by Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as EGNOS in Europe and WAAS in the US to provide lateral and vertical guidance. Instrument landing systems (ILS), Precision Approach Radar (PAR), and ground-based GNSS augmentation landing systems (GLS) are 3D approaches, which work independently from PBN. RNP1 is a form of RNAV navigation specification (for arrival, initial, intermediate and missed approach segments). Note: This question was recently reported in a Flight Planning in Poland.",

It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a Magnetic bearing of 100o (or Radial 090) emanating from the Aberdeen aerodrome symbol. An aircraft being on a magnetic bearing of 100o and at a distance 13 NM off the aerodrome will have a radar minimum altitude of 2 500 ft.",

            "explanation": "The aircraft must fly at 3 300 ft as this is the MOCA (Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for a given flight level/altitude, in this case we have the temperature at the aerodrome, which is -7ºC at an elevation of 27 ft amsl. As this is so close to sea level, we can say that the ISA temperature is 15ºC, and therefore the ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction for the minimum true altitude (3 300 ft). The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (22) × (3300/1000) = 290.4 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 590.4 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (22 hPa) x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3590.4 ft + (660 ft) = 4250.4 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level suitable for that magnetic track above 4250.4 ft, which is FL60, as per the semicircular rule. The semicircular rule works based on the magnetic track of an aircraft, and for tracks of 000º-179º, IFR aircraft should fly at odd flight levels (FL70, FL90, etc.), and for tracks from 180º-359º, even flight levels (FL60, FL80, etc.) RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The temperature is ISA, therefore temperature correction may be disregarded. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 540 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 800 ft + 540 ft = 8 340 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 235º(M).

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­510 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 25 000 ft + 510 ft = 25 510 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. In this case, the temperature is not provided, therefore we will assume ISA conditions. Thus, the height of the aircraft above airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 25 510 - 3 500 ft = 22 010 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This is the closest available learning objective to this question, and even though none of the given options actually refer directly to the learning objective itself, it does give valuable guidance on which options to reject. All modern transport aircraft will have Flight Management Computers (FMCs) fitted. Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations. The normal calculation method is for the FMC to use actual wind to the next waypoint and pilot-inputted forecast winds beyond that. The actual wind is calculated using FMS position and groundspeed, heading (provided by the IRS or AHRS), and TAS (provided by the Air Data Computer, which is an outside input). The GNSS/FMC combination is not able to detect weather (that is down to the weather radar), nor does it ask for fewer data from the air data computer, as all the ADC data is still put to use within various onboard systems. Also, a route check before each flight is still essential, to check that the route has been inputted correctly by the pilot. There is no automatic route check, the FMC will happily fly any wrong route just as well as a correct one. ETA is continuously updated using real-time GNSS data, which provides real-time positioning data that includes information about the aircraft's ground speed and track, enabling pilots to have accurate time-of-arrival estimates throughout the flight. Also when integrated with onboard weather systems or data from air traffic control, GNSS enables pilots to continuously monitor and account for actual wind conditions affecting the aircraft's flight path. Therefore, the most correct answer would be to provide accurate ETA predictions and calculate the remaining fuel accurately. Note: The feedback on this question is mixed; the question is believed to be almost exactly correct, but the options are not as precise. Any exam feedback on this question would therefore be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. Be sure to remember as much as you can of the above learning objective, so if you do get this question in your exam (it is quite common) and the options are not the same as we have here, you can choose the correct one more easily.",

Z: If the flight initially will be operated under VFR, followed by one or more subsequent changes of flight rules. (The ATC flight plan should have been filled with the letter I (for IFR) in item 8-INCORRECT) After the aircraft's departure from the Lahr aerodrome towards ECHO reporting point, when the aircraft is provided with the IFR clearance being at 1 500 ft AGL, it is within a controlled airspace Class D with an upper vertical limit at 2 500 ft AGL. Approaching at ECHO reporting point, the aircraft enters in a Class E uncontrolled airspace with a lower vertical limit at 1 000 ft AGL. (IFR flights are allowed inside class E airspace and they are subject to an ATC clearance.) (IFR flight inside class E airspace is NOT allowed-INCORRECT) When flying in accordance with an ATC clearance inside or outside controlled airspace in IFR, the Pilot-In-Command is not relieved of the basic responsibility for ensuring the safety of the aircraft, including terrain avoidance, but he/she is responsible for terrain separation in flight at all times, unless under vectors by radar, where the Radar Controller will issue clearances such that the required obstacle clearance will exist at all times. (In VMC conditions while flying IFR inside controlled airspace the Pilot-in-Command is solely responsible for terrain separation-INCORRECT because not responsible for situations in which he/she is being vectored.) When issuing an IFR clearance inside controlled airspace, the ATC controller assumes responsibility for terrain separation.-CORRECT Although this is the most correct option among the options, it is not entirely correct. The pilot is responsible for safe operation, except when being vectored or sent directly to an off-route waypoint.

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at a minimum true altitude of 9 220 ft (7220 + 2000). This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (10) × (9220/1000) = 369 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules above, to give an indicated altitude of 9 589 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 9589 + 690 = 10 279 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level suitable for that magnetic track above 10 279 ft. Semi-circular cruising level system - Non RVSM flight levels - IFR Magnetic Track 360° - 179° = ODD LEVEL Magnetic Track 180° - 359° = EVEN LEVEL As the Magnetic Track is 175º, an odd level shall be used, so the next usable IFR flight level up from 10 279 ft is FL110",

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of the trip fuel, which requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate aerodrome (ERA). The Minimum Take-Off Fuel is equal to the sum of the following: Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Estimated flight time = 2 856 kg/h x 3.95 hr = 11 281 kg. Contingency fuel: 3% x Trip fuel = 3% x 11 281 kg = 338 kg. Alternate fuel: Average fuel flow x Estimated flight time to the alternate = 2 856 kg/h x 20/60 = 952 kg. Final reserve: 30 min at Holding fuel flow = 2 600 kg/h x 30/60 = 1 300 kg. Thus, totally the Minimum Take-Off Fuel required is: 11 281 kg + 338 kg + 952 kg + 1 300 kg = 13 871 kg.",

The aeroplane flies in still air conditions, thus TAS = GS. So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 164 NM is: Distance / TAS = 164 NM / 422 kt = 0.39 hr.

According to the criteria, ERA A should be situated 750 - 200 = 550 NM from the departure aerdrome, and in reality it is situated 500 NM - Which means that contingency cannot be reduced to 3% (3) Calculate contingency according to regulation Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 AMC1 CAT.

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (i)(A) = 5% x 5000 kg = 250 kg (ii) 5 min x 1200 kg/h = 100 kg",

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

The corresponding possible amount of extra fuel is obtained by subtracting the minimum required fuel as described above from the maximum permissible fuel load. MTOM limit: The actual take-off mass (ATOM) for a planned flight can be found by adding the minimum required take-off fuel to the zero fuel mass (ZFM). The amount of extra fuel that can be added is the difference between this ATOM and the maximum take-off mass (MTOM): ATOM = 3825 lb + 705 lb = 4 530 lb MTOM - ATOM = 6 250 lb - 4 530 lb = 1 720 lb The take-off limit would allow us to carry 1 720 lb of extra fuel. MLM limit: The actual landing mass (ALM) is equal to the ATOM minus the planned trip fuel. The amount of extra fuel that can be added is the difference between this ALM and the maximum landing mass (MLM): ALM = 4 530 lb - 375 lb = 4 155 lb MLM - ALM = 4 500 lb - 4 155 lb = 345 lb That means that 345 lb of extra fuel are allowed to remain in the tanks upon arrival. However, this is not the amount of extra fuel that may be loaded due to the fuel penalty. Rule of thumb: to calculate fuel penalty, use the following formula: (MLM extra / 100) x Y - where \"Y\" is the variable given by the question, in this case = 10 ( 345/100) x 10 = 34.5 lb Therefore, the extra fuel that can be loaded is: 345 lb + 34.5 lb = 379.5 lb Fuel tank capacity: Maximum Tank Capacity - (Take off fuel + Taxi fuel) 1 100 lb - (705 lb) = 395 lb",

Please direct your attention to the accompanying note situated in the table: \"Increase/decrease fuel flow by 3% per 10°C above/below standard TAT.\" Based on the given information, the TAT at FL380 is -44°C, which is 12°C lower than the standard TAT of -32°C. Consequently, the final FF/ENG is calculated as follows: Final FF/ENG = 923 kg/h - 3.6% of 923 kg/h = 889.772 kg/h The aircraft has two engines, therefore the total fuel flow is: 2 x 889.772 kg/h = 1779.5 kg/h Once more, we will make use of the attached table to establish the True Airspeed (TAS) at FL380. Kindly consult the relevant section of the attached table: 38 000 ft (-32°C) TAS (kt) 433 This, however, is not the final TAS value for the particular flight. Please refer to the accompanying note positioned above the table: \"Increase/decrease TAS by 1 knot for every 1°C above/below standard TAT.\" According to the information provided, the TAT at FL380 is -44°C, which is 12°C lower than the standard TAT. Consequently, the final TAS is calculated as follows: Final TAS = 433 kt - 12 kt = 421 kt At a speed of 421 kt, the duration needed to cover a distance of 240 NM can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance/Speed = (240 NM)/(421 kt) = 0.57 hours Therefore, with a fuel flow rate of 1779.5 kg/h, we can determine the anticipated fuel consumption for the flight at FL380: Fuel consumption = (0.57h) x (1779.5 kg/h) = 1014 kg",

For instance, this is often the case with certain Mediterranean islands. It can be cheaper to carry (tanker) as much fuel as possible from the departure airport rather than refuel at the destination. You may also need to tanker fuel if the destination airport is short on fuel or unable to provide it, due to reasons such as a workers' strike or a broken fuel pipeline. However, carrying more fuel than legally required incurs a commercial penalty because more fuel is burned carrying the additional mass. Therefore, you need to calculate whether it is worth doing. In an airline operation, this decision is usually made by the operations department, and you would notice from the operational flight plan that you are tankering fuel.",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

MPA.181 Fuel/energy scheme - fuel/energy planning and in-flight re-planning policy — aeroplane BASIC FUEL SCHEME — PRE-FLIGHT CALCULATION OF USABLE FUEL FOR PERFORMANCE CLASS A AEROPLANES For the pre-flight calculation of the usable fuel in accordance with point CAT. OP. MPA.181, the operator should: (a) for taxi fuel, take into account the local conditions at the departure aerodrome and the APU consumption; (b) for trip fuel, include: (1) fuel for take-off and climb from the aerodrome elevation to the initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (2) fuel from the top of climb to the top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (3) fuel from the top of descent to the point where the approach procedure is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival routing; and (4) fuel for making an approach and landing at the destination aerodrome; (c) for contingency fuel, calculate for unforeseen factors either: (1) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight re-planning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; or (2) an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions, whichever is the higher; (d) for destination alternate fuel, include: (1) when the aircraft is operated with one destination alternate aerodrome: (i) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to the missed-approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed-approach procedure; (ii) fuel for climb from the missed-approach altitude to the cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (iii) fuel for cruising from the top of climb to the top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (iv) fuel for descent from the top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival routing; and (v) fuel for making an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; and (2) when the aircraft is operated with two destination alternate aerodromes, the amount of fuel that is calculated in accordance with point (d)(1), based on the destination alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of fuel; (e) for FRF, comply with point CAT. OP. MPA.181(c);.(c) final reserve fuel/energy that shall be the amount of fuel/energy that is calculated at holding speed at 1 500ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions according to the aeroplane estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome, or destination aerodrome when no destination alternate aerodrome is required, and shall not be less than: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the fuel/energy to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for turbine-engined aeroplanes, the fuel/energy to fly for 30 minutes;. (f) for additional fuel, include an amount of fuel that allows the aeroplane to proceed, in the event of an engine failure or loss of pressurisation, from the most critical point along the route to a fuel en route alternate (fuel ERA) aerodrome in the relevant aircraft configuration, hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, make an approach, and land; (g) for extra fuel, include anticipated delays or specific operational constraints that can be predicted; and (h) for discretionary fuel, include a quantity at the sole discretion of the commander. BASIC FUEL SCHEME WITH VARIATIONS — CONTINGENCY FUEL (a) Contingency fuel variations are methods of reducing the basic amount of contingency fuel based on established mitigating measures. (b) If the operator establishes and maintains a fuel consumption monitoring system for individual aeroplanes, and uses valid data for fuel calculation based on such a system, the operator may use any of the requirements in point (c) or (d) of this AMC to calculate the contingency fuel. (c) The contingency fuel should be the fuel described in points (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AMC, whichever is higher: (1) an amount of fuel that should be either: (i) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel, or in the event of in-flight re-planning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight provided that a fuel en route alternate (fuel ERA) aerodrome is available; or (ii) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20-minute flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption; or (iii) an amount of fuel based on a statistical fuel method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel; prior to implementing a statistical fuel method, a continuous 2-year operation is required during which statistical contingency fuel (SCF) data is recorded — note: to use SCF on a particular city pair/aeroplane combination, sufficient data is required to be statistically significant; the operator should use this method to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination, and to carry out a statistical analysis to calculate the required contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; or (2) an amount of fuel to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions.",

Interpolation is required between 777 NAM and 798 NAM. 781 is within 777 (38 500 kg) and 798 (38 600 kg). First find the difference between NAM at 38 500 kg (777) NAM at 38 600 kg (798) = 21NM => for an \"interval\" of 100 kg If you divide 100 by 21 you will get the corresponding mass for each 1 NM. 100 / 21 = 4.8 kg Which means that each NM corresponds to 4.8 kg. Now we need to find the corresponding mass to 781: 781 - 777 = 4 NM 4 (NM) x 4.8 kg = 19.2 kg 38 500 kg + 19.2 kg = 38 519 kg Start mass - new mass = fuel burn 40 000 kg - 38 519 kg = 1481 kg.",

Final Reserve fuel is: For aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes For aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1500 ft above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. For this question, the minimum amount of fuel required on arrival at the destination aerodrome/heliport is the Final Reserve Fuel 1075 kg.",

The standard way of calculating contingency fuel was, historically, to calculate the highest of 5% of trip fuel or 5 min of holding fuel. Nowadays, with long haul flights (sometimes as long as 16h), 5% of trip fuel would be quite a lot. Using the RCF Procedure, allows this contingency fuel to be significantly reduced.

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price. You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass",

EASA AIR OPS AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel which should include: (i)fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander. In this case: TAXI Taxi fuel is 10L. 10 L TRIP Departure + Cruise + Approach + Landing 40 L + (2 h 24 min x 95) + 20 L = 288 L CONTINGENCY The greater of: 5% of trip fuel or 5 min holding 288 x 5% = 14.4 L Or 5 min x 76 L/h = 6.3 L ALTERNATE Departure aerodrome will be used as an alternate 40 L + (2 h 24 min x 95) + 20 L = 288 L FINAL RESERVE For aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes 45 min x 76 L/h = 57 L ADDITIONAL Not required 0 L TOTAL (BLOCK FUEL) 10 L + 288 L + 14.4 L + 288 L + 57 L = 657.4 L",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome.

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency fuel can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of trip fuel. Use of this option requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate (ERA) aerodrome, which must cover some prerequisites: Shall be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance, the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight plan distance, or at least 20% of the total flight plan distance plus 50 NM, whichever is greater. For this question, the Minimum Block fuel required is equal to: Taxi fuel + Trip fuel + Contingency fuel + Alternate fuel + Final Reserve fuel + Additional fuel(if required) + Extra fuel(if required) Taxi fuel = 150 kg Trip fuel = 2101 kg Contingency fuel (if an enroute alternate is available)= 3% x planned trip fuel or 5 min holding at 1500 ft above the destination aerodrome (whichever is greater) = 3% x 2101=63 kg or 5/60 x 2735 kg/hr = 228 kg. Thus, contingency fuel is 228 kg. Alternate fuel = 2046 kg Final Reserve fuel (for turbine engines) = fuel for 30 min holding at 1500 ft = 30/60 x 2735 kg/hr = 1367.5 kg. Therefore, the minimum block fuel required is: 150 kg + 2101 kg + 228 kg + 2046 kg + 1367.5 kg = 5892.5 kg, which is very close to 5893 kg.",

(5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of the trip fuel, which requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate aerodrome (ERA). The Minimum Take-Off Fuel is equal to the sum of the following: Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Trip time = Average fuel flow x (Air distance / Estimated TAS) = 3048 kg/h x (2725 NAM / 431 kt) = 19 271 kg. OR Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Trip time = Average fuel flow x (Route distance / Estimated GS) = 3048 kg/h x [2548 NM / (431 - 28) kt] = 19 271 kg Contingency fuel: 3% x Trip fuel = 3% x 19 271 kg = 578 kg.

Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 1830 NM by interpolating between 1500 NM and 2000 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 210 000 kg. If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering. With regards to this question, Planned take-off mass: 190 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial. HOWEVER, first we must check if we are limited by the Maximum Take Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass or Maximum tank capacity. Our Maximum Take-Off Mass will be the lowest of Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) and Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel: MTOM = 205 000 kg Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel = 180 000 kg + 22 000 kg = 202 000 kg (lowest) => Meaning that we could carry an extra amount of fuel equal to 202 000 kg - 190 000 kg = 12 000 kg => However, our Maximum Fuel tank capacity = 40 000 kg and we already have 30 000 kg onboard => which means that we can only carry 10 000 kg of fuel extra.",

In order to reduce the environmental impact, the pilot will consider the least possible fuel tankering.

For the flight LFPG-EIDW, the crew have loaded a total of 5 226 kg. This means they will land at EIDW with 1 906 kg onboard (after burning taxi, contingency and trip fuel). For the flight back (EIDW - LFPG), the crew needs a minimum block fuel of 7 100 kg. Therefore, at LFPG, they should load 7 100 kg - 1 906 kg = 5 194 kg extra. However, carrying more fuel, adds weight to the aircraft and increases the fuel consumption. So, the fuel penalty from LFPG to EIDW must be applied. For every weight change per 1 000 kg, add 60 Kg to the Total fuel: 5 194 kg / 1 000 x 60 kg = 312 kg. Therefore, the Minimum fuel amount that must be tankered, after applying the Fuel Penalty at LFPG must be: 5 194 kg + 312 kg = 5 506 kg.",

Just take a careful look at the values and note that: OAT from ISA to ISA + 20° C will increase fuel consumption by 1.2 % Headwind from 0 to 30 kt will slow us down with ISA + 5° C (increase fuel consumption by 0.3 %). Our new TAS will 429 and GS will be 399. Therefore trip time will increase about 429 / 399 = 1.07 times. Which will be proportional to fuel consumption. Option with the same 30 kt headwind and lower than ISA temp. is definitely consume less fuel than the previous one as at lower than ISA temperatures less fuel consumed. Finally about 50 kt headwind option our TAS will be 424 and GS will be 374. Trip time increase is 424 / 374 = 1.13 Therefore assuming the same fuel flow clearly this one will cause greatest increase in trip fuel required.",

Solving for x, we get x = (2.5 x 66)/25 tonnes = 6.6 tonnes. Since the estimated remaining fuel at 44N 040W is 36.3 tonnes, we can estimate that the remaining fuel at 40N 050W will be 29.7 tonnes (36.3 tonnes - 6.6 tonnes).",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

Enter the table at 50 000 kg and read the corresponding distance: 3261 NM. After consuming 1000 kg of fuel, we will have a mass of 49 000 kg. Enter the table at 49 000 kg and read the corresponding distance: 3063 NM Which gives us a range of 3261 NM - 3063 NM = 198 NM for 1000 kg 2. Since the temperature changed from ISA conditions to ISA +10ºC (-45ºC) => we must perform the fuel adjustment: Read Note 2 at the bottom of the table: \"A) Increase fuel required by 0.6 percent per 10 degrees C above ISA\" 1000 kg x 0.6% = 6 1000 kg + 6 kg = 1006 kg (meaning that at ISA +10ºC, the aircraft will consume 1006 kg to cover 198 NAM. Therefore, the distance we can travel on 1000 kg = 198 x (1000/1006) = 196.8 NAM, a reduction of 198 - 196.8 = 1.2 NAM ATPLQ Note: We would kindly ask anyone who has further information on this question to contact us.

For the trip time in still air conditions, use the graph given with the following manner (red dashed line): Enter with the ground distance 2000 NM at the bottom of the graph. Move vertically upwards until crossing the pressure altitude line \"29 & ABOVE\". Continue horizontally to the right to read trip time: 4.80 hr. For the trip time with a headwind component of 25 kt proceed as (blue dashed line): Enter again with the ground distance 2000 NM at the bottom of the graph. When hitting the REF LINE move parallel to the grid line until intersecting the headwind component of 25 kt. Move vertically upwards until crossing the pressure altitude line \"29 & ABOVE\". Continue horizontally to the right to read trip time: 5.15 hr. As expected, the trip time increases by 0.35 hr, which corresponds to: [(5.15 - 4.80) / 4.80] x 100 = + 7.3 %, which is very close to +7.6%.",

To calculate the fuel flow required for the ground distance 220 NM, the actual time flown is required: Actual time= Ground distance / Ground speed. With a 45 kt tailwind, the groundspeed will be 433 + 45 = 478 kts. Applying the note, the TAS must be reduced by 1 kts for each degree below standard TAT. So, it becomes: 478 - 10 = 468 kts The a/c will cover the ground distance 220 NM with 468 kts groundspeed in: 220/468 = 0.47 hour = 28.2 min Applying the note, the fuel flow must be reduced by 3% per 10o C below standard TAT. So, it becomes: 923 - (3% x 923) = 895 kg/hr. For 0.47 hour flight time, the a/c will burn: 895 x 0.47 = 420 kgs per engine, so both engines will burn: 420 x 2 = 840 kgs.

The question intentionally asks from the students to fill in the table, because the answer comes from the sum of the flight times which correspond to each fuel amount related with the airborne time (excluding taxi fuel). The Contingency fuel is: 5% x Trip fuel = 5% x 5 800 kg = 290 kg, which corresponds to a flight time of: 5% x 02:32 = 7.6 min. The Final Reserve fuel for a twin jet aeroplane is always fuel to fly for 00:30. The Extra fuel is: Ramp fuel - Taxi fuel - Trip fuel - Contingency fuel - Final Reserve fuel - Alternate fuel = 585 kg. The fuel flow for the Extra fuel is given as 2 400 kg/hr. So, the Extra fuel of 585 kg will permit to fly for: 585 kg / 2 400 kg/hr = 14.6 min. Thus, the ATC endurance is the sum of the following flight times: 02:32 + 00:07.6 + 00:42 + 00:30 + 00:14.6 = 04:06.2, which is very close to 04:07.",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

The three curves on the right hand side of the graph represent the FUEL, TIME and AIR DISTANCE values for climbing, for specific conditions (TOM 4750 lb, Climb speed 120 kt IAS, etc.). To calculate the fuel, time and distance from take-off to Top of Climb, follow the procedure below: Enter the graph on the left side base scale at the aerodrome OAT +8°C and travel vertically up to intersect the aerodrome Pressure Altitude 4000 ft grid-line. From this grid-line move horizontally right to intersect the fuel, time and distance grid-lines in turn. From each intersection drop vertically to read the appropriate value from the graph: FUEL = 3.8 USG TIME = 7 min AIR DISTANCE = 11 NAM Repeat the above three steps, but with the ToC OAT and PA: Enter the graph on the left side base scale at the ambient temperature at the top of climb OAT: -6°C and travel vertically up to intersect the top of climb Pressure Altitude 10000 ft grid-line. From this grid-line move horizontally right to intersect the fuel, time and distance grid-lines in turn. From each intersection drop vertically to read the appropriate value from the graph: FUEL = 8.5 USG TIME = 16 min AIR DISTANCE = 28 NAM Finally, subtract the values determined at aerodrome pressure altitude from those determined at TOC, to obtain the values of the fuel used to climb, the time taken to climb, and the air distance travelled in the climb: FUEL from T/O to ToC = 8.5 - 3.8 = 4.7 USG TIME from T/O to ToC = 16 - 7 = 9 min AIR DISTANCE from T/O to ToC = 28 - 11 = 17 NAM",

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander SUMMARY: Trip fuel is the amount of fuel required for everything from the takeoff roll at the departure aerodrome UNTIL end of the landing roll on touchdown at the destination aerodrome. This includes all climbs and descents, and a single approach and landing at the destination. This does not include Contingency fuel, Final Reserve, Additional fuel etc.",

Please direct your attention to the accompanying note situated in the table: \"Increase/decrease fuel flow by 3% per 10°C above/below standard TAT.\" Based on the given information, the TAT at FL360 is -17°C, which is 15°C higher than the standard TAT of -32°C. Consequently, the final FF/ENG is calculated as follows: Final FF/ENG = 1 163 kg/h + 4.5% of 1 163 kg/h = 1 215.335 kg/h The aircraft has two engines, therefore the total fuel flow is: 2 x 1 215.335 kg/h = 2 430.67 kg/h Once more, we will make use of the attached table to establish the True Airspeed (TAS) at FL360. Kindly consult the relevant section of the attached table: 36 000 ft (-32ºC) TAS (kt) 450 This, however, is not the final TAS value for the particular flight. Please refer to the accompanying note positioned above the table: \"Increase/decrease TAS by 1 knot for every 1°C above/below standard TAT.\" According to the information provided, the TAT at FL360 is -17°C, which is 15°C higher than the standard TAT. Consequently, the final TAS is calculated as follows: Final TAS = 450 kt + 15 kt = 465 kt At a speed of 465 kt, the duration needed to cover a distance of 295 NM can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance/Speed = (295 NM)/(465 kt) = 0.6344 hours Therefore, with a fuel flow rate of 2 430.67 kg/h, we can determine the anticipated fuel consumption for the flight at FL360: Fuel consumption = (0.6344) x (2 430.67 kg/h) = 1 542 kg",

(2) Read the TAS at the top right of the table: 426 kt (OAT = ISA, therefore, no temperature correction should be applied) (3) Ground Speed = TAS - headwind Ground Speed = 426 - 25 = 401 kt (4) Convert 3261 NAM into NGM: NGM = 3261 x 401/ 426 NGM = approx. 3070 NGM SECOND STEP: (1) Enter the table at 49 000 kg and read the corresponding distance: 3063 NAM. (2) Adjust this range to account for the increased fuel burn at higher than ISA temperature (ISA +10°C) using the information from note 2A.

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

The planned trip fuel is 1280 US gal. Therefore, after 1 h 15 min, 1280 - 859 = 421 US gal of fuel were consumed. Fuel flow (FF) = 421 US gal / 1 h 15 min = 336.8 US gal / h 2) Determine the distance remaining after 1 h 15 min: Total distance from A to B: 320 NM Distance covered in 1 h 15 min: 119 NM Distance remaining = 320 - 119 = 201 NM 3) Time taken to cover 201 NM: Average TAS: 115 kt Wind component: 20 kt headwind Therefore, the Ground Speed = 95 kt Flight time = 201 NM ÷ 95 kt = 2 h 7 min 4) Determine the fuel consumed during 2 h 7 min (to cover 201 NM): Fuel flow (FF) = 336.8 US gal/ h Fuel consumed = 2 h 7 min x 336.8 US gal/ h = 713 US gal 5) Calculate the actual fuel at the destination: Total fuel consumed = 421 US gal + 713 US gal = 1134 US gal Actual fuel at destination = 1280 US gal - 1134 US gal = 146 US gal Number of barrels = 146 US gal/ 45 US gal = 3.3 ≈ 4 Note: The fuel referred to as trip fuel in this question is apparently the total fuel on board.",

(e.g. the actual planned route distance) The Air Distance is the Ground Distance, modified by the expected winds to show how many miles are to be covered through the air (a headwind makes this value higher than the Ground Distance, whereas a tailwind will reduce it). It is calculated by the formula; NAM/TAS = NGM/GS where NAM is Nautical Air Miles and NGM is Nautical Ground Miles. The Great Circle Distance (G/C DIST) is the direct distance from departure to destination aerodrome, following the great circle (shortest) track around the Earth. In this question, the GND DIST is shorter than the AIR DIST, due to an average headwind of 30 kts. Note: The difference in distance between the surface and cruising altitude due to radius of the great circle is almost negligible, so is not a factor.",
