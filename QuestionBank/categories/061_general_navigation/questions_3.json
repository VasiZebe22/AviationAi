One of the most important things to remember about the Earth's shape is that it is only very slightly oblate. The diameter from the North Pole to the South Pole (the shortest diameter) is approximately 12,714 km (6,860 NM). The equatorial diameter (the longest diameter) is approximately 12,756 km (6,883 NM). This is not a big difference, but it does make the Earth not quite a sphere. Therefore: The polar diameter of 6,860 NM produces a circumference of 21,554 NM, each minute of arc being equal to 0.998 NM The equatorial diameter of 6,883 NM produces a circumference of 21,626 NM, each minute of arc being equal to 1.001 NM",

The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively). Thus, at mid-latitudes, such as 33°N, the sunrise occurs earlier and earlier every day.",

            "explanation": "Radial is a magnetic bearing extending from a VOR/VORTAC/TACAN. Drift is the angle difference from heading to track The aircraft flies along the radial 310° inbound a VOR, then its magnetic track is: 310° - 180° = 130°M. And since it drifts by 10oR, then its magnetic heading is: 130°M - 10o = 120oM. For this question using your Navigation/Flight computer, apply the following steps: Place the centre dot over the TAS 480 kt. Set the Magnetic heading 120o under the True Index. Put a mark where the 10o starboard drift and the Groundspeed 415 kt coincide. Rotate the circular bezel until the mark you have made is exactly below the centre dot on the 0o drift line. The magnetic wind direction is shown under the True Index 075o (M). The wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot and the value under the mark: 480 kt - 380 kt = 100 kt. Therefore, the magnetic wind direction and speed is: 075°(M)/100 kt. E6-B Flight Computer Procedure: We are given a GS of 415 kt and TAS of 480 kt, however the wind speed on the slide reaches a maximum of about 264 kt, we can still use the E6-B flight computer following these steps: If your E6-B flight computer includes a high-speed side, you can skip the following steps and proceed directly to the procedure below using the given GS and TAS values. Divide the GS and TAS by 5: GS: 415 kt / 5 = 83 kt TAS: 480 kt / 5 = 96 kt Now, with GS = 83 kt and TAS = 96 kt, proceed as follows: Multiply the calculated (steps below) wind velocity by 5. Calculation of Magnetic Wind Direction and Velocity: Position the slide until the ring aligns with the speed arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (83 kt). Rotate the transparent disk to align the Magnetic Track (130°) under the TRUE INDEX. Determine the Wind Correction Angle (WCA): With a Drift angle of 10° to the right, WCA = 10° left. With the ring on the Ground Speed (83 kt) arc, mark the point where the 10° left WCA intersects the True Airspeed (96 kt) arc. Rotate the transparent disk until the mark aligns with the centerline, ABOVE the ring, between the ring and the TRUE INDEX. Count the lines between the ring and the mark to determine the Wind Velocity. In this case, with the ring on the 83 kt arc and the mark on the 103 kt arc, Wind Velocity = 100 kt (103 - 83 = 20, 20 x 5 = 100). Read the Magnetic Wind Direction under the TRUE INDEX. In this case, the value is 075°, resulting in Magnetic Wind Direction = 075°.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.

            "explanation": "Radial is a magnetic bearing extending from a VOR/VORTAC/TACAN. Drift is the angle difference from the aircraft’s heading to its actual track (track made good). When tracking inbound on Radial 325°, then its magnetic track is: 325°M - 180° = 145°M. Thus, its true track is: 145°M + 8° = 153°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 10° right, its heading is: 153°T - 10° = 143°T. When tracking outbound on Radial 075°, then its magnetic track is 075°M and its true track: 075°M + 8 = 083°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 10° right, its heading is: 083°T - 10° = 073°T. A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 150 kt and put true heading 143°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 10° right drift. Now put the next heading 073°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 10° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 028°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (150) and the value under the drift lines intersection (118): 150 kt - 118 kt = 32 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 028°/32 kt.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction.

The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

            "explanation": "Some questions might give you a range of wind values and TAS values at various altitudes and a true track and ask for the average groundspeed. In these cases, the TAS and W/V to use on the Flight/Nav computer is as follows: For Climb problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The aircraft climbs from MSL (0 ft) to FL270. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: 0 ft + [2/3 x (27 000)] ft = 18000 ft For the wind velocity at 18 000 ft then, we would usually have to interpolate 3/5ths of the way from 15 000 ft to 20 000 ft, but the winds are the same so no interpolation necessary. We can use the wind velocity 310º(T)/45 kt. For OAT, the ISA temperature at 18 000 ft is 15 - 2(18) = -21ºC, and the OAT is ISA +5ºC, so OAT = -16ºC To find the groundspeed, we first needs to calculate the TAS. (We have used a CRP-5 and the wind-down method here) On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 18 000 ft with the OAT of -16ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 280 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 373 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is over 300 kt, this needs to be corrected. In the COMP. CORR. window, calculate and apply the small correction in the direction of the arrow (only 0.7 divisions). Go back to the CAS of 280 kt on the inner scale, and read off the new TAS of 369 kt on the outer scale. The Groundspeed can be found using the wind side of the computer. Set wind direction 310ºT under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the centre point on the TAS of 369 kt * Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially set the True Track 045°T under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would give 6º drift and a track of 051º, so reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 045º. This occurs at a heading of 038º with 7º Right drift. The groundspeed of this track is approximately 370 kt Therefore the average groundspeed for the climb is 370 kt, closest answer 371 kt. *Note: If your flight computer does not include high speeds, set 269 kt or 169 kt at the center point as TAS (TAS - 100 kt or TAS - 200 kt) and follow the rest of the procedure. At the final Ground Speed result you will need to add the 100 kt or 200 kt that you subtracted from TAS.",

This right angle corresponds to the angle formed by the W/V vector and the Ground Speed/True Track vector. If we denote θ as the angle between the Ground Speed/True Track vector and the True Airspeed/True Heading vector, the relationship can be expressed as follows: sin(θ) = Wind Velocity/True Airspeed = 30/100 = 0.3 ⇒ θ = 17.46º ≈ 17°.

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (3/15) x 60 = 12º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (3 / (105 - 15)) x 60 = 2º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 12º + 2º = 14º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

            "explanation": "The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to its orbital elliptical path around the Sun at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth's equator is 23.5o. The Sun will be exactly overhead 23.5o N in June, when \"the northern hemisphere summer solstice\" takes place and we have the longest day. Also, it will be overhead 23.5o S in December, when \"the northern hemisphere winter solstice\" will take place and we will have the longest night. The latitudes 23.5o N and 23.5o S are called the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively and represent the highest latitudes where the Sun will be directly overhead. The tilt of the Earth's axis is responsible for the longer nights in winter and the longer days in summer. It also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. Between the solstices are the Equinoxes, when the Sun is passing over the Equator, where night and day are of equal length. The equinoxes are the times when the relative length of night and day and the elevation of the noon sun, known as the declination of the Sun, are changing at the greatest rate. If you consider the time of sunrise at different points on the Earth's surface, it quickly becomes clear that the Sun rises at different times at different longitudes, because of the rotation of the Earth and different latitudes, because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively).",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

Rotate the window disc to position the True Heading (118º) beneath the TRUE HEADING index. Calculate the Drift Angle. With True Track at 105º, derive Drift Angle as 13º Left (Port) from the window disc. Identify the point on the slide where the Left Drift Angle of 13º intersects the arc for Ground Speed (480 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline BELOW the center dot. Determine Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the vector between the center dot and the pencil mark. In this case, with the center dot on the 465 arc and the pencil mark on the (approximately) 357 kt arc, the Wind Velocity is approximately 108 kt (465 - 357 = 108). Read the (True) Wind Direction below the TRUE HEADING index. With the value 209 below the TRUE HEADING index, ascertain that the (True) Wind Direction is 209º.",

Map reading is the determination of aircraft's position, by matching natural or built-up features with their corresponding symbols on a chart. Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring, where the pilot must be able to visualise the terain and physical features from symbols on the map. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. The choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. The rule for choosing a ground feature is to find something as unique as possible, such as masts, railways, rivers, bridges, etc. Also, the map to ground technique is recommended to avoid confirmation bias, for instance spotting a tower on the ground and convincing yourself that it is the church tower you would dearly like it to be on the map. For this question, the pilot chose ground features (towers, villages) as turning points, which are identical with many others and can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. Also, VFR navigation at lower levels, as in our case 1500 ft above ground, restricts the view ahead and around by the next fold of high ground and objects may only appear when you are close to them and when they are not obscured by high ground. Probably, the pilot changed course at a wrong village, because of his/her low cruise altitude and not recommended ground features choice.",

To re-join the original track at A, we must find the track correction to reach B. For that, we need to find the distance off-track first. We have been given the Track Angle Error (TKE) of 5º to the right. We can determine the distance off track by applying the following formula: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track 5º = (distance off track × 60) ÷ 48 distance off track = (5º x 48) ÷ 60 = 4 NM The correction to reach B will be: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 30 TKE = 8° ⇒ Turning 5º to the left will lead us to fly parallel to the original track. Turning an extra 8° to the left will direct us to \"B\". 5° + 8° = 13° to the left to go direct to \"B\".",

This exercise is asking us to determine the actual wind, and we will solve it using with the flight computer. To determine the actual wind we need the information related to actual path of aircraft over the ground, G/S and actual track and as well the TAS and actual heading information. Based on the forecasted wind, and using the flight computer we can determine the aircraft planned heading and G/S. Solving from Heading (HDG), knowing WV, TAS and required track. Set wind direction to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 190 kt. Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 355º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 7ºR drift and a track of 362º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 355º. This occurs at a heading of 348º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 186 kt. At a ground speed of 186 kt, after 30 min of flight, the distance covered should be 93 NM. However, according to the question text, tha aircraft is 4.5 NM ahead = 97.5 NM. Therefore, the actual ground speed = 97.5 NM x 2 = 195 kt To determine the actual track over the ground, we will calculate the actual TKE and add it to the planned track. TEK = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TEK = ( 3,5 / (93 + 4,5) ) x 60 = 2ºR 2º right means that the actual track of the aircraft over the ground is 355º + 2º = 357º Knowing the GS 195 kt, TAS 190 kt, heading 348º and track 357º, it is possible to determine the actual wind using the flight computer by following the steps below: Determining winds with the flight computer: Set True Heading (348ºT) under \"True Index\" Place centre dot over TAS (190 kts) Mark the point where drift (9ºR) and GS (195 kt) meet. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (253º) Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (190 - 160 = 30 kt) Actual W/V = 253º / 30 kt",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of GNAV, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their General Navigation exam.",

Density altitude is not particularly important to GNAV specifically, and calculating it is not part of the GNAV learning objectives, so you should appeal this question if you see it in a GNAV exam. Feedback from one authority shows that has been seen in this exam. Density altitude is a measure of the environmental air density, in comparison to where you would find that same density in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), so you end up with an altitude measurement. A high density altitude means low air density, and a low density altitude means high air density (what you would get at low-level). Density altitude can be calculated in 2 main ways, by flight computer or by mathematical calculation. By flight computer (CRP-5) it is relatively simple, in the \"AIR SPEED\" window, line up the pressure altitude with the OAT, and read off the density altitude in the \"DENSITY ALTITUDE\" window (x1000 ft). In this case, you get just under 9000 ft, but this is not the most accurate measurement in the world. We could show a picture in the annex, but flight computers are each very slightly different, so different answers could easily be found on different computers. By mathematical calculation, you take the pressure altitude, and adjust it for temperature by 120 ft per °C different from ISA. As high temperature is lower density, this means that higher than ISA temperature means a higher density altitude, and lower than ISA temperature means a lower density altitude. ISA temperature at 5500 ft (FL55) is 15 - 2(5.5) = 4°C, so with an OAT of +33°C, we are at ISA +29°C, meaning our density altitude is higher than our pressure altitude. The difference is 120 ft/°C x 29°C = 3480 ft, so the Density altitude is 5500 + 3480 = 8980 ft, closest answer 9000 ft",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 150 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 266º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 274º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 160 kt. It is normal during flight that the track over the ground is different from the desired trajectory defined during planning. If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 GS = 160 kts Planned track distance flown = 160 x 15’ = 40 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 NM.

When following a magnetic track of 250°M, its true track is: 250°M + 10°E = 260°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 8° Left, its heading is: 260°T + 8° = 268°T.

A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 180 kt and put true heading 268°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 8° left drift. Now put the next heading 342°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 8° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 305°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (180) and the value under the drift lines intersection (144): 180 kt - 144 kt = 36 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 305°/ 36 kt.",

(1) Place the track (316º) under the true index. (2) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the ground speed (144 kt). (3) The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value then the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. (4) Maintaining the central grommet over the GS line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS and make a pencil mark. (5) Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centerline between the grommet and the true index. (6) Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark: 35 kt. (7) Read the true wind direction under the true index: 245º.",

Therefore, the aircraft loses 3 500 ft in: 3 500 ft / 750 ft/min = 4.67 minutes or 4 minutes 40 seconds. Finally, the aircraft to reach downwind from cruise altitude 5 500 ft to the traffic pattern altitude 2 000 ft following a 3° glidepath angle, the descent must be initiated at 12 NM prior to downwind, and with a Rate of Descent of 750 ft/min, it will last for 4 minutes 40 seconds.",

The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is the highest Latitude listed below at which the sun will rise above the horizon and set every day\" is 64º. However, according to feedback, it seems that there is a question where the option “64º” is not available. In such case, we have received feedback which confirms the correct option to be “62º”. At the moment, there might be 2 different versions of this question (yet to be confirmed): When the options available include 62º and 64º, the correct option is 64º. When the options available include 62º and all remaining options are higher or equal to 66.5º. In this case, the correct option is 62º.

            "explanation": "The Earth is roughly spherical. Because of its spin it is slightly fatter at the equator and slightly flattened at the poles, a shape known as an oblate spheroid or an ellipsoid. You might come across the term \"Geoid\". In geodesy, a reference ellipsoid is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid. Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude and elevation are defined. Modern navigation systems, like GPS, ude these reference systems and the most common of these is the World Geodetic System of 1984 or WGS 84, created by the United States military. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic latitude is the angle that a line drawn perpendicular to the surface through a point on a spheroid makes with the equatorial plane (plumb-line on the ellipsoid) and is other than the geocentric (earth centred) latitude. Despite the fact that, in general navigation, we assume that one degree of latitude along a meridian equals to 60 nm. In fact, using a WGS84 ellipsoid, one degree of latitude has a length of 59.7 nm (110.574 km) at the equator and increases progressively with increasing latitude up to 60.3 nm (111.694 km) at the poles.",

First of all, using the coordinates given find the position of TRENT (TNT) VOR and POLE HILL(POL) VOR on the E(LO)2 chart. The two VORs are close to isogonal 2° W. So, following the rhyme “Variation West, Magnetic Best”, find the true bearings for each radial. The True bearing for Radial 306° is: 306°-2°=304° and true bearing for Radial 223° is: 223°-2° =221°. Use your plotter and draw with your pencil a True bearing 304° from TRENT VOR and a True bearing 221° from POLE HILL VOR. The intersection between these two True bearings is the aircraft’s position. Therefore, the coordinates of the aircraft’s position are N53°25', W002°35’.",

True track (T) Variation (V) Magnetic track (M) 060º 15º E 045º Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (130 kt). (2) Place wind direction (190º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (30 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (060º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (130 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 147 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => 10ºR. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, True Heading = TT + 10ºR = 060º + 10ºR = 070º(T) Convert true heading into Magnetic: Use the mnemonic: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

            "explanation": "The aircraft initially flies South, i.e. 180° along a meridian, for 416 NM to point B. It is known that \"1' change of latitude along a meridian or the Equator equals to 1 NM\". So, 416 NM along a meridian correspond to: 416' or 6° 56' change of latitude. Since the aircraft flies South, the latitude will decrease and the latitude at point B will be: 48°12’ N - 6° 56' = 41°16’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point B will be: 41°16’ N 004°52’ E. After point B, the aircraft continues East, i.e. 090° along a parallel of latitude, for 200 NM to point C. The distance along a parallel of latitude is given by the formula: Departure (NM) = Change of Longitude(') x Cosine of Latitude. Solving for Change of Longitude('), we get: Change of Longitude(') = Departure (NM) / Cosine of Latitude = 200 NM / Cos 41,27° = 266' or 4.43° or 4° 26'. Since the aircraft flies East, the longitude will increase and the longitude at point C will be: 004°52’E + 4° 26' = 009°18’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point C will be: 41°16’ N 009°18’ E.",

            "explanation": "A great circle is the largest possible circle that can be drawn around a sphere. All spheres have great circles. If you cut a sphere at one of its great circles, you'd cut it exactly in half. A great circle has the same circumference, or outer boundary, and the same centre point as its sphere. The geometry of spheres is useful for mapping the Earth and other planets. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but it maintains the general shape. All the meridians on Earth are parts great circles. Meridian and its anti meridian for a great circle. Meridians, including the prime meridian, are the north-south lines we use to help describe exactly where we are on the Earth. All these lines of longitude meet at the poles, cutting the Earth neatly in half. The Equator is another of the Earth's great circles. If you were to cut into the Earth right on its Equator, you'd have two equal halves: the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator is the only east-west line that is a great circle. All other parallels (lines of latitude) get smaller as you get near the poles. Great circles can be found on spheres as big as planets and as small as oranges. If you cut an orange exactly in half, the line you cut is the orange's great circle. And until you eat one or both halves, you have two equal hemispheres of the same orange. Great circles are also useful in planning routes. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere is always a segment of a great circle. Plotting great circles comes in very handy for airplane pilots trying to fly the shortest distance between two points.",

This reduced gravity causes the land around the Equator to bulge outwards by approximately 21 km, while making the land at the poles appear flattened. The Earth is, therefore, an irregularly shaped ellipsoid, which is flattened at the poles and bulges at the Equator. This is slightly squished shape is called geoid.

The aircraft departs at 12:15 and we know that at 12:27 (after 12 minutes), the aircraft has covered 40 NM. Ground speed = (40 ÷ 12) x 60 = 200 kt The off track error of 4 NM (1 NM + 3 NM) is recognized at 12:37. We need to calculate the distance along track and the TKE (Track Angle Error) at this position. Time from A to railroad track (40 NM) ⇒ 12:27 - 12:15 = 12 min Time from railroad track to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12:37 - 12:27 = 10 min Time from A to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12 min + 10 min = 22 min If the aircraft's ground speed is 200 kt, in 22 minutes, it will cover: (200 kt x 22 min) ÷ 60 = 73 NM Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 73 TKE = 3° (approx.) If we alter our heading by 3.3° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: Distance to go = 80 NM - 73 NM = 7 NM TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 7 TKE = 34° (approx.) So turning 3° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 34° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 3° + 34° = 37º (approx.) would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the right, therefore we must fly 37º to the left. Track = 235º - 37º = 198º The aircraft is 80 NM – 73 NM = 7 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 7 NM in 2 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:37 + 2 min = 12:39",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 280 kt. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºR drift and a track of 275º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 265º with 5ºR drift. All this means is that, to counteract an expected drift of 5ºR, the aircraft flew a heading of 265º(T). However, after covering a distance of 60 NM, our track error angle is 10º left, meaning our track made good has been 260º (T) Calculating the difference between our heading and the track made good results in 5º to the left (265ºT to 260ºT). The average drift observed from 10:20 UTC to 10:32 UTC amounts to 5º to the left. Note: Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading.

If short of fuel or near controlled airspace and not in contact with ATC, set 121.5 MHz and make a PAN call. 5. If that is not necessary, check the directional indicator (DI) and compass are still synchronised and continue to fly straight and level and on route plan heading. Thus, statement 3 is incorrect. 6. Estimate the distance travelled since the last known position. 7. Compare the ground with your estimated position on the map. When the aircraft’s position is uncertain, ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. This is “ground to map”. Thus, statement 5 is incorrect. 8. Once the position has been re-established, keep checking the heading and continue the flight by updating the estimated position regularly while looking for unique features such as hills, valleys, lakes, wood, built-up areas, rivers, coastlines, motorways and railways.

The fuel amount to cater for things that don't go to plan, such as stronger headwinds, re-routing, a flight level other than expected, is called \"Contingency fuel\". Also, any aircraft must be landed with at least the Final Reserve Fuel in its tanks. If it looks like that it will land with less than Final Reserve Fuel, EU OPS says that the pilot must declare an emergency. But, for this question the Contingency fuel may not be sufficient and so as to avoid any consumption of the Final Reserve Fuel while being still on the air before landing, the best action is to reduce, as much as possible, the remaining ground distance and flight time until the destination, by turning before the scheduled turning point and flying directly to the destination, provided that the ATC is informed of the pilot's intentions accordingly and no safety issues emerge. An emergency landing at the nearest suitable field may pose at risk both the passengers and the aircraft and would be recommended in case the remaining fuel was not sufficient to reach at any other suitable airfield. Flying to a lower altitude would decrease the TAS and the Groundspeed, thus the required flight time and fuel to destination would increase. Any orbit would further increase the flight time and total fuel consumption until destination. Further instructions from the ATC should be asked while continuing towards the destination without wasting flight time.",

The limited visibility at night might cause difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points to verify the position of the aircraft and cross-check the aircraft track, thus there is a danger of flying into terrain in the case of being lost. Therefore, the difficulty to identify the navigation features at night is the most significant hazard because it directly affects the pilot's ability to navigate safely and accurately during the flight. Tall obstacles at night are properly marked, and can be managed with proper planning, preparation, and adherence to procedures designed for night flying. Note: The difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points is caused due to limited visibility, so the choice 'Limited visibility and off-navigation challenges.' is a hazard but the most significant aspect of limited visibility is the inability to identify the landmarks. This is why the choice 'Difficulty in identifying landmarks and reference points.' is chosen the correct one.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: There exist two akin questions within the database. Question 615066 specifies the pilot being lost. In cases where the pilot cannot verify their position, it is advised to initiate the \"unsure of position\" procedure. Should the pilot be unable to ascertain their position even after, they should proceed with the \"lost procedure.\" Nevertheless, if the pilot possesses knowledge of their location, they should proceed according to the original plan. In this case, given that the flight is scheduled to take place over a snowy region lacking ground landmarks, the pilot needs to exercise meticulous care in adhering to the predetermined headings. It's crucial to uphold situational awareness throughout the entire flight duration, consistently assess the flight's progress, and particularly when approaching a designated turning point devoid of visible ground references, make the turn toward the subsequent waypoint according to the pre-calculated time established during the planning phase. Unlike question 615066, this particular question does not indicate that the pilot is disoriented or lost. Consequently, there is no justification for initiating the \"lost procedure\". Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam as we have not been able to verify its correct option as of yet.",

They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air.

When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. A tall rectangular building is a suitable ground feature for VFR navigation, because it is has the following characteristics: It has enough vertical extent to be identified from a considerable distance and altitude, and it has a distinctive shape that makes it easily recognizable. It is prominent and unique, standing out against the surrounding terrain. It makes contrast with its surroundings due to differences in shape and elevation.",

Frequent changes may be needed to maintain the correct airspeed, while climbing or descending over undulating ground. The view ahead and around is restricted by the next fold of high ground. The angle at which you are looking becomes flatter and if a feature does not have some vertical extent, you are unlikely to see it at low level. A selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Thus, it will be difficult to fly past them.

They are all asking for the best VFR features but have different options. We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. PICKING THE BEST VFR CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. With regards to this question, large water reservoir and tall masts are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique. Farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby. Telephone lines are very difficult to see from high up.",

Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air.

One of the most common methods to navigate under VFR is by selecting, during the pre-flight planning procedure, the ground features, which are marked on the VFR chart and then seeking for them on the ground during the flight. The VFR charts depict topographic features and other information of interest to pilots flying visually, such as major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, airspace boundaries, etc. During VFR navigation, the cadets are usually instructed to hold the map oriented to the direction of flight, so that the surrounding topographic features can be easily identified, i.e. hold the map so that direction of flight is at the top (not North), also known as \"track-up\", so \"right\" on the map will correspond to \"right\" on the ground and map reading will be easier. Using the chart “track-up”, gives the best situational awareness to the crew and it can also be useful to check if the aircraft is on the planned position by checking if the ground features coincide with your expectations. Also, for convenience during flight, it is not necessary to hold the whole navigation chart, but it is preferred to hold only a a relevant with the trip part of the whole chart, so as not to reduce the pilot's field of view and handling effectiveness. \"North-up\" map orientation is mainly suggested for flight planning.",

CFIT occurs when an airworthy aircraft under the complete control of the pilot is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle.

Many CFIT accidents occur because of loss of situational awareness and may happen not only in night or IMC conditions, but even in a VFR flight during the day. Accidents where the aircraft is out of control at the point of impact are not known as CFIT. Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT. Overcast sky and Snow-Covered Terrain - CORRECT: This is a situation where the snow-covered terrain and the overcast sky are mixed making the horizon invisible. The lack of the poor colour contrast, ground features and shadows increase the likelihood of loss of situational awareness by the pilot, creating illusions of climbing or descending while he/she actually flies level.",

However, they also serve as excellent visual checkpoints due to their visibility from a distance, especially in favorable weather conditions. These features become valuable references for navigation purposes. However, It's essential to recognize that the usefulness of features with substantial vertical extent may decrease as you fly at higher altitudes. When flying at 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL), a 400-foot-high mast might become difficult to spot due to its diminished visual prominence. \"A railroad perpendicular to the track.\" CORRECT. This is a conspicuous landmark with a great extent which can be easily located and identified from the altitude at which a VFR flight is normally operating. since this road is crossing perpendicularly the planned track, the crossing point could be used to check for any time deviation and to calculate the actual ground speed. \"A straight highway along the calculated track.\" INCORRECT. A landmark, even if easily identifiable, is not useful to check the aircraft's groundspeed as it wil not be crossing the path at any point. When flying, because of the great extent along the track, a second conspicuous landmark close to the crossing point is required. \"A large waterway in the direction of the aircraft’s nose.\" INCORRECT. While a large waterway can be a visual reference point and used as a checkpoint, it may not be as accurate or easy to measure ground speed as a perpendicular railroad track. Determining ground speed using a waterway may involve more challenges including, in this case, lack of perpendicular reference: Unlike a railroad track, which runs perpendicular to your flight path, a waterway may or may not be at a right angle to your track. Measuring the time it takes to fly over a distance along the waterway may not directly correspond to your ground speed due to the angle between your flight path and the waterway.",

PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? With regards to this question, large lakes, tall masts and an active power station are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This is absolutely ridiculous from the examiner, but most recent feedback from both Spanish and Polish authorities (at least these two, maybe more) have indicated the correct answer to be something close to, \"This reference point could easily merge with the snow-covered terrain.\". Of course, the examiners and authorities have focussed on the fact that the buildings here are mostly white (hence blending in with snow), but have seemingly not noticed the 500 ft tall building with multiple other colours and a huge USA flag on the side, which would be noticeable in even the most snow-covered landscape. As always, any feedback from the real exam is very useful, and please let us know which authority you sat with as well, thanks! The choice of ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. When flying in the winter, it is often necessary to rely on more prominent ground features. So, among others, you should also consider: The size and the uniqueness of the features. Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent, such as high radio masts or large, conspicuous buildings will be easier to identify. Time of year. Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. For example, after a recent snowfall, roads and railway lines may be totally obscured, woods and farmlands can blend in to surrounding fields, but big lakes and rivers might stand out more. Coastlines in particular will stand out firmly from the surroundings, as their appearance is not affected by snowfall. The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is low (for example a white building against snowy white terrain), then the range at which objects can be seen is reduced, and the ease of seeing them is reduced also. This particular landscape has pros and cons, as the buildings are mostly white, which do not stand out well against snow covered ground, however, it must be noted that this particular building is incredibly large, not fully white coloured, and certainly would be lit due to its size (it is over 500 ft tall). The image also includes lakes, rivers and is next to a coastline, which would be very easy to pick out in the snow. This is the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida, USA.",

Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT. One major factor of CFIT is the loss of situational awareness — failing to know at all times what the aircraft’s position is, how that position relates to the altitude of the surface immediately below and ahead, and how both relate to the course being flown. One of the contributory factors is weather: Rain, turbulence, clouds and icing, may increase the workload of the pilot and cause interference reducing the accuracy of radio navigation beacons. Poor visibility, particularly at night can contribute to disorientation and loss of situational awareness.",

We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. This particular question states that \"large water features\" are not correct, and that aligns with recent feedback for this question, however, \"large water features\" are correct for question 615371, due to the different options. The wording might be different in the exam, which might make it clearer why this is the case. This question has also been seen as a \"choose 3\" question in the UK CAA. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. EASA do like them as VFR features though, so bear that in mind.",

When flying in the winter, it is often necessary to rely on more prominent ground features. So, among others, you should also consider: The size and the uniqueness of the features. Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent, such as high radio masts, will be easier to identify. Time of year. Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. For example, after a recent snowfall, roads and railway lines may be totally obscured, woods and farmlands can blend in to surrounding fields, but big lakes and rivers might stand out more. The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is low (for example a white building against a snowy white mountain), then the range at which objects can be seen is reduced. Coastlines are the most prominent ground features, since their appearance from the air is not affected by the snowfall.",

Visual navigation is the use of topographical maps to monitor or fix the aircraft's position. Map reading is the determination of aircraft's position, by matching natural or built-up features with their corresponding symbols on a chart. Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, as in our case, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. For this route, there are many identical ground features (airports, towns, villages), which can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. As soon as the position of the aircraft is in doubt: Note the time Communicate, if in contact with an ATC unit to request assistance Consider using any ground navigational aids that may be available to give position information etc. For this question, the pilot should be advised by RODING VOR/DME along the whole trip, which is the only ground navigational aid in the vicinity of the route's turning points, so as to ensure that he follows his planned route and to correct promptly any inattention which may cause any inadvertent drift. If tuned on the RODING VOR/DME frequency, the pilot will figure out that instead of Radial 130o from RODING VOR/DME, which intersects the planned turning point VILSHOFEN airport, he/she finally is on Radial 110o from the same VOR/DME, which intersects the non-scheduled turning point ELSENTHAL-GRAFENAU airport.",

They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. The selected feature has a white colour. On a winter day, during a special VFR flight with low clouds, reduced visibility, and a snowy surface, the feature will have the same colour with the ground and the surrounding features.

Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air.

But, the power lines are rarely installed over mountain ridges and if installed their height is quite low. \"Represent a danger when power lines cross a valley.\" - CORRECT: In most cases the power lines cross valleys rather than ridges. Over a snowy area, the high voltage power lines can be easily distinguished, but not the low voltage ones due to their smaller vertical extent.",

These landmarks should be easily locatable and distinguishable from the VFR flight altitude. Using these landmarks, pilots can monitor flight progress and calculate ground speed. \"1. Dual-carriageway (four line) road crossing the intended track.\" INCORRECT. This is a prominent landmark, yet its vast expanse presents challenges for pilots in accurately identifying the precise crossing point from the air. As a result, it is advisable not to rely solely on this landmark for drift error checks. \"2. Dual-carriageway (four line) road crossing a river close to the intended track.\" CORRECT. This prominent landmark lies in close proximity to the intended flight track, distinguished by its substantial size and stark contrast against the surroundings. During the planning stage, pilots can use its position as a reference point relative to the track. While in-flight, comparing the aircraft's position with this easily identifiable landmark on the chart enables the assessment of any potential drift error. \"3. Disused railway crossing a river on intended track.\" CORRECT. Even though the railway line is disused, the point where this railway line crosses the river can be easily located due to the color contrast with the surroundings. \"Single carriageway (two line) road crossing a railway close to intended track.\" CORRECT. Similar to a Dual-carriageway (four-line) road, this conspicuous landmark lies in close proximity to the intended flight track and can be easily located and identified from the altitude of a VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flight. By cross-referencing the aircraft's position relative to this landmark during the flight, the pilot can pinpoint their location on the chart and assess for any potential drift error.",

            "explanation": "NOTE: There is another question in the database that is similar to this question (615463) and asks for the best VFR features, but it has different options. We have seen many different feedback for these questions and we believe there are several versions used by EASA. So far the ‘rule’ for these questions is that ‘farmland’ is never correct and if high-tension power lines are present, they are correct (this is a debatable point, but sometimes a good VFR feature, particularly in forested areas). After that, it is common sense. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Power lines aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. And, a farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby.",

It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated. The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

As they are no longer on their flight planned route, following the OFP is not very useful, and the low cloud means they cannot climb higher whilst remaining VMC. When a pilot becomes in doubt about their position, they should perform some or all of the following actions: 1. Note the time. 2. Communicate, if in contact with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, to request assistance. 3. Consider using any radio-navigation aids that may be available to give position information. 4. If short of fuel or near controlled airspace and not in contact with ATC, set 121.5 MHz and make a PAN call. 5. If that is not necessary, check the directional indicator (DI) and compass are still synchronised and continue to fly straight and level and on the planned heading. 6. Estimate the distance travelled since the last known position. 7. Compare the ground with the aircraft's estimated position on the map. When the aircraft’s position is uncertain, ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Line features such as coastlines, railways, large highways, etc. can be easy to find and useful to then fly along until you can find your position on the map. 8. Once the position has been re-established, keep checking the heading and continue the flight by updating the estimated position regularly while looking for unique features such as hills, valleys, lakes, wood, built-up areas, rivers, coastlines, motorways and railways. In any case, maintain VMC and visual contact with the ground, note the fuel state and, if necessary, try to identify an area suitable for a precautionary landing.",

Being a high obstacle over the ground in icing conditions and over an area covered by snow the high pylons will stand out cause the snow will not stack over the power line pylons. The same for high antennas which are identified on the VFR charts. The question should be clearer because it depends on the time of the year, on the conditions (if there was some snow and/or cold temperatures before, and for how long) and EASA should also mention the location. Depending on conditions and location, rivers can freeze. Several students confirmed that \"high-tension lines\" was correct in their official examination and that the answers given were \"high-tension lines\" (instead of \"electrical line\") and \"river\" (instead of large river), so we changed the question and correct answer in 2 016-06.

The choice of ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. So, among others, you should also consider the uniqueness and the contrast of the ground features. After examining the options given below the answer, we come to the following conclusions: The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is high (for example a valley against a hilly area), then the range at which objects can be seen is increased. A hill or a slightly steeper hillside within a hilly area does not provide uniqueness. Also, few small rivers that leave a big river may provide contrast, regarding the colours against the surrounding environment, but they are not unique. The big river at its own could be a preferable ground feature as a visual reporting point contrary to the few small rivers. Therefore, the best visual reporting point for an aircraft flying a VFR flight above a hilly area, seems to be a valley.",

Disorientation is likely when there are fewer visual cues and references, such as horizon and other line features. \"Terrain and obstacles along an approach may not be clearly visible.\" - Correct.

Please keep sharing your feedback with each other and with us in the comments, it is always useful, especially with questions like this. We have added a table to the explanation to easily convey our current knowledge of which authorities are choosing which answer. Thanks again! Authority Reported answer Poland B UK A It seems that there might be two versions of this question, one asking why the pilot should keep his/her chart oriented to True North and the other why s/he should keep the chart oriented to True track. The correct option will differ whether it asks for True North or true track. It is advisable that the VFR chart should be lined up with the current track so that it depicts what you see outside. It is also easier to identify line features such as roads, rivers, and coastlines and track their progress along those features. This is particularly important for visual navigation, where the pilot relies on visual references to navigate, as it helps them to maintain situational awareness and stay on course. For instance, expected ground features left/right of the planned track on the chart can be spotted and identified easily on the ground. Orientation to the track direction helps the pilot to maintain situational awareness. The pilot can easily identify the location of the aircraft in relation to the surrounding terrain and navigation aids, which is essential for making safe and efficient navigation decisions. However, if the question asks the reason why the chart should be oriented to True North the correct is \"Aeronautical and topographical information can be easily read.\" If you need to read a frequency, for example, you should turn the chart to True North.",

These checkpoints are selected based on certain characteristics to ensure they are easily recognizable and can be reliably identified from the air. When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration.

Based in the calculation of the position of airplane based in the direction and the ground distance traveled from a determined point. With the introduction of modern navigational techniques such as GPS and conventional radio navigational aids, this may seem outdaated technique. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with. Reference to a GPS or other navigation aid. It is likely that a route from the departure aerodrome directly to the destination will be divided into a number of route segments with the creation of turning points and waypoints. Breaking the route down into route segments brings several advantages: 1. Route segment can be selected to pass near a prominent ground feature, to help the pilot fly on track. 2. Shorter route segments minimize off-track errors by reducing the time allowed for them to develop. 3. High terrain or significant obstructions like telecommunication masts can be avoided. Really important in poor visibility conditions. Choose compact ground features as turning points and waypoints to ensure that routes are flown with precision. Large build up areas make poor turning points because of their size.",

NOTE: QDM is the reciprocal of QDR; QUJ is the reciprocal of QTE. Converting a Relative Bearing (RBI) into a True Bearing: Apply aircraft variation to the magnetic heading to get true heading. Add relative bearing to true heading in order to obtain true bearing TO the station If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station.

Deviation varies with magnetic latitude, aircraft heading and changes in aircraft electronic equipment. The difference between the direction of magnetic north and that of compass north is called \"deviation\". Deviation is measured in degrees and is described as \"East\" (+) or \"West\" (-). To determine whether the deviation should be added or subtracted, use the rhyme: “Deviation East - Compass Least“ “Deviation West - Compass Best“ According to the figure’s compass deviation card, to fly a magnetic heading of 300°, the aircraft must steer to a compass heading of 298°. And since the compass heading is 2° less than the magnetic heading, then the deviation is 2°E.",

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (7/41) x 60 = 10º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (7/41) x 60 = 10º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 10º + 10º = 20º R The aircraft is left off-track, the aircraft must fly right to regain track.",

The poles of this hypothetical earth-magnet do not lie on the earth’s spin axis, this lack of symmetry giving rise to magnetic variation - the angular difference between the True North (TN) and the Magnetic North (MN).

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading. From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 004º 001ºW 003º 5ºW 358º",

WCA is of equal amount with the drift, but it has opposite direction. For example, when drift is 4oL, the WCA that must be made is 4oR. At this question, you have to distinguish the pre-flight with the actual data. The pre-flight WCA is 8oL, because the pilot was expecting a drift of 8oR due to the wind. But the actual drift is not 8oR as expected, but it is 2o more to the right, 10o R. Therefore, the actual track of the a/c will be also 2o more to the right in comparison with the planned track.

The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration. Dead reckoning is subject to cumulative errors. Advances in navigational aids that give accurate information on position, in particular satellite navigation using the Global Positioning System, have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, inertial navigation systems, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied. By analogy with their navigational use, the words dead reckoning are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities. Accuracy of DR depends on many factors: 1- Time since last position update. 2- Meteorological accuracy of the forecasted wind. 3- Accuracy of heading and speed (GS) flown. 4- Knowledge of pilots in Navigation.",

The distance-off track is required for the second correction, which is given by the 1:60 rule based formula: (Distance off track / Miles travelled) = (Degrees to parallel / 60). Solving for Distance off track we get: Distance off track = Degrees to parallel x Miles travelled / 60 = 4o x 45 NM / 60 = 3 NM. The second correction that must be so as to intercept position B, is given by the 1:60 rule based formula: (Distance off track / Miles to go) = (Degrees to intercept / 60). Solving for Degrees to intercept we get: Degrees to intercept = (Distance off track x 60) / Miles to go = (3 NM x 60) / (75 NM - 45 NM) = 6o left.

In our case, the altitude ½ from FL 290 to MSL is FL145 or 14,500 ft. Air temperature at FL145 in ISA conditions is: 15oC - (2oC x 14,500/1,000) = -14oC, but with average ISA deviation -8oC (air is colder by 8oC), the actual air temperature is: -14oC - 8oC = -22oC. Using the airspeed correction window of your nav computer, find the TAS at 14,500 ft. 1. Align Pressure altitude 14,500 feet with actual air temperature -22oC. 2. Opposite CAS 250 kt (inner disc), read TAS 308 kt (outer disc). Using the wind side of your nav computer find the Groundspeed, with TAS: 308 kt, Track: 210o(T) and W/V at 14,500: 310°(T)/45 kt. Set wind direction to 310º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 308 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 210º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 8ºL drift and a track of 202º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 210º. This occurs at a heading of 218º with 9ºL drift.

The 1:60 rule states that: \"For each degree of drift angle you will be one NM off-track having travelled 60 NM along track\". If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM. If so, 2 NM off-track must equate to a 6º drift angle and 3 NM off-track must equate to a 9º drift angle. For this question, the aircraft experiences the 2.4 NM off-track distance between the lake and the track, 11 minutes from the previous waypoint. So, the distance from the previous waypoint until the aircraft flies above the small lake is: Distance = GS x Flight time = 115 kt x 11/60 hr = 21 NM. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which is off-track 2.4 NM after 60 NM, will have a drift angle of 2.4º. Thus, after 21 NM, the aircraft will have a drift angle of: 2.4º x 2.86 (60/21)= 7º (rounded).",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS decrease. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 264 kt and a TAS of 365 kt, at a higher altitude during the climb, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be lower. Therefore, the option that gives both a CAS less than 264 kt and a TAS less than 365 kt is TAS at 356 kt and CAS at 233 kt.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Keep in mind, to determine the drift the reference is heading to track. True Track is 245º with drift 5º R, True Heading is 240º.

To re-join the original track at A, we must find the track correction to reach B. For that, we need to find the distance off-track first. We have been given the Track Angle Error (TKE) of 4° to the right. We can determine the distance off track by applying the following formula: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track 4° = (distance off track × 60) ÷ 48 distance off track = (4° x 48) ÷ 60 = 3 NM The correction to reach B will be: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 30 TKE = 6° ⇒ Turning 4° to the left will lead us to fly parallel to the original track. Turning an extra 6° to the left will direct us to \"B\". 4° + 6° = 10° to the left to go direct to \"B\".",

Accuracy of DR depends on: Time elapsed since last fix; Accuracy of the wind velocity used; Accuracy of headings and airspeeds; Skill and knowledge of the pilot. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.

Method 1: The Height difference is: 18 000 ft - 3 000 ft = 15 000 ft The Groundspeed is: TAS + Tailwind component = 130 kt + 30 kt = 160 kt 25 NM / 160 kt = 0.15625 hours 0.15625 hours × 60 minutes/hour ≈ 9.4 minutes 15 000 ft / 9.4 minutes ≈ 1 600 ft/min Method 2: The following formula can be used: Height difference (ft) = Glidepath Angle(o) x Covered Distance (ft) / 60. The Height difference is: 18 000 ft - 3 000 ft = 15 000 ft. So, solving for Glidepath Angle, we get: Glidepath Angle(o) = (Height difference (ft) x 60) / Covered Distance (ft) = 15 000 ft x 60 / (25 x 6080 ) ft = 5.9o. The Groundspeed is: TAS + Tailwind component = 130 kt + 30 kt = 160 kt. Thus, ROD = (Glide Angle/60) x (Groundspeed/60) x 6080 = (5.9/60) x (160/60) x 6080 = 1 594 ft/min, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 3: For a 3o glideslope angle only, the following formula states: ROD = 5 x GS = 5 x 160 = 800 fpm. Thus, for a 5.9o glideslope angle, the ROD will be: 800 fpm x 5.9o / 3o = 1 573 fpm, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 4 (using your Flight/Nav computer): Set the glide path angle 5.9º(59) over 60. Read out the ROD 1 600 ft/min (16) approximately over the GS 160 kt (16).",

Consequently, utilizing interpolation, we deduce: With an 8 000 ft increase in pressure altitude, wind direction decreases by 10°. With a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind direction decreases by x°. Calculating: x = (10° x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 8.75° ⇒ wind direction at FL170: 310° - 8.75° = 301.25°. Similarly, For an 8000 ft pressure altitude increase, wind velocity increases by 15 kt. For a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind velocity increases by y kt. Computing: y = (15 kt x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 13.125 kt ⇒ wind velocity at FL170: 5 kt + 13.125 kt = 18.125 kt. Consequently, the wind parameters at FL170 are: 301.25°/18.125 kt.

To calculate TAS, we can use the AIR SPEED window of our flight computer (we have used a CRP-5), and line up 7 000 ft against our OAT of +4ºC. Then on the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 160 kt and read off the TAS of 179 kt on the outer scale. To calculate groundspeed, we just add 12 kt to the TAS for our wind component. GS = 179 + 12 = 191 kt. We have our heading and track, but they are in Magnetic. We will keep them in Magnetic for now, and remember to apply the variation to our calculated wind velocity at the end (it reduces the number of calculations slightly this way). The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (low speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (156º) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (179 kt) under the central point Note the drift to the track (TRK = 150º, so drift = 6º Left) and place a dot where that drift line meets the groundspeed (191 kt). (we have shown a line for better viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre, and place the central dot over the zero point near the bottom of the slider. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top and the wind speed as the value under the dot that you added. Our magnetic wind velocity is 275º(M)/23 kt. (Mag. var. 8ºE) Using the phrase, \"Variation East, Magnetic Least\", the true wind direction is 8º greater. True wind velocity = 283º(T)/23 kt",

In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 10 TKE = 18º The result is greater than 15º and therefore inaccurate. Trigonometry: tan α = 3 NM / 10 NM α = tan-1 (3/10) ≈ 17º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 17° on top of that will direct us to the final destination.

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track.

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (4/40) x 60 = 6º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (4/60) x 60 = 4º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 6º + 4º = 10º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

(2) Place wind direction (020º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (60 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (070º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (483 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 442 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => approx. 6ºL. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, heading = TT - 6ºL = 070º - 6ºL = 064º Determine the magnetic heading: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

It also refers to the plane of this path and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent orbit of the Sun around the Earth. The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to this orbital path at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth’s equator is 23.5o. When we are at the Equator, the daylight does not vary significantly over the year, whereas if we are near the poles, the difference between summer and winter is very dramatic. When looking at total sunlight received, the poles generally have lower sunlight, because even in their summer, there is much lower land area relative to the equator. The tilt of the Earth of the Earth’s axis also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day except at high latitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of year higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter. The reason for the variation of the duration of daylight throughout the year is the inclination of the Earth’s axis of rotation to the ecliptic. Therefore, Cambridge, which has a relatively high latitude (52oN) will have more hours of daylight on the 1st July and fewer hours of daylight on the 1st January.",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant CAS, both TAS and Mach speed increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the climb the instruments' cross-check shows TAS at 336 kt and Mach speed 0.55, at FL280 both TAS and Mach speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and Mach speed higher than 336 kt and 0.55 correspondingly, is TAS 357 kt and Mach 0.59.",

So its actual Groundspeed is: GS = Distance / Time = 37 NM / (14/60) = 158 kt. Thus, it covers the distance of 50 NM from the aerodrome to the turning point in: Time = Distance / GS = 50 NM / 158 = 0.31 hr or 19 min. Therefore, the aircraft's Estimated Time of Arrival at the turning point will be: 22:14 + 19 min = 22:33. But the aircraft is not above overhead the aerodrome as planned, but 5 NM right off it, because the wind is not as forecast. Using your Navigation/Flight computer follow the steps below: Firstly, find the Track Error Angle, which is also the degrees to parallel: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance gone 37 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to parallel 8.1o (81) on the outer scale. Secondly, find the degrees to intercept at the next turning point: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance to go 50 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to get back to track at the turning point 6o (60) on the outer scale. Thus, the total correction to the heading must be: 8.1o + 6o = 14.1o. And since the aircraft is off track to the right, the total correction to the heading must be to the left. Therefore, the heading to intercept the turning point must be: 175o - 14.1o = 160.9o, which is close to 161o.",

Therefore, the required heading to reach at B is: 037⁰T + 12° = 049⁰T.",

For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. 1. The aircaft descends from FL200 to 2 000 ft. The 1/2 of the cruising altitude is at: [1/2 x (20 000 - 2 000)] ft + 2000 ft= 11 000 ft. 2. Air temperature at FL110 in ISA conditions is: 15oC - (2oC x 11 000/1,000) = -7oC, but with average ISA deviation -7oC (air is colder by 7oC), the actual air temperature is: -7oC - 7oC = -14oC. 3. Using the airspeed correction window of your nav computer, find the TAS at 11 000 ft. 1. Align Pressure altitude 11 000 feet with actual air temperature -14oC. 2. Opposite CAS 200 kt (inner disc), read TAS 234 kt (outer disc). 4. The Groundspeed can be found using your flight/nav computer with TAS 234 kt and the W/V at FL110: 060°(T)/45 kt (after interpolating the wind conditions at 2 000 ft and at 20 000 ft): Set wind direction to 060º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 234 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 165º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 10ºR drift and a track of 175º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 165º. This occurs at a heading of 155º with 11ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 242 kt.",

This solution has a few parts to it, so we will take you through the planning and then the actual calculations. Working backwards, we have a heading and TAS from the OFP, so need the actual track (Track Made Good, TMG) and groundspeed (GS) of the aircraft from Fruges windfarm to Wimereux. The ATA of 14:43 allows us to calculate the GS, and the position 1 NM right of Wimereux allows us to calculate the TMG. Groundspeed The ATA (Actual Time of Arrival) abeam Wimereux was 14:43, making the leg 12 minutes long from the ATA at the previous waypoint (14:31). The distance of the leg is 23 NM. 12 minutes long is 12/60 = 0.2 hours. Groundspeed (kt) = Ground Distance (NM) / time (hours) Groundspeed = 23 NM / 0.2 = 115 kt Track Made Good (TMG) 1 NM off track over a 23 NM leg distance, we can use the 1 in 60 rule to calculate the angle of drift off the expect track. 1 x (60/23) = 2.6° right of planned track. This gives a true track for that leg of 310° + 2.6° = 312.6°, but for further calculation we will just use TMG = 313° Wind Calculation (we have used the CRP-5 and wind-down method) With your flight computer on the wind side, set the true heading to 300° and the centre point over the TAS of 110 kt. Then make a mark where the line of 13° right drift (corresponding to the TMG of 313°) and the Groundspeed of 115 kt meet. Take this point and place it directly underneath the centre dot, then you may take the centre dot to the top of the vertical grid section and read off the wind direction and strength. All directions were in \"true\" so no variation required. The wind component is closest to 205°(T)/25 kt.",

Then, find the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 210 kt on the inner scale. Finally, read the True Airspeed (TAS) on the outer scale opposite the CAS of 210 kt on the inner scale. In this case, the True Airspeed (TAS) is 275 kt. Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: Move the slide until the center dot falls on the arc marked i.e. 275 (you can choose any arc you like as this will not affect the final result, we choose the TAS). Next, rotate the window disc to align the True Wind Direction (050°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. Draw a downward line starting from the ring along the centerline, with a length equal to the Wind Velocity (40 kt). Then, rotate the window disc to align the True Track (270°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. The end of the line should be approximately 5° to the Left of the centerline, which corresponds to a 5° Left (Port) Drift Angle. Therefore, WCA is 5ºR. To determine the Ground Speed, find the speed arc that passes under the end of the line drawn. In this case, the Ground Speed is 305 kt. Wind Correction Angle is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track. In this case, the WCA is 5º R (drift is 5ºL), the true heading = 270º + 5º = 275º (T). Let's determine the Magnetic Heading: True heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass heading (C) 275º 7ºE 268º Variation West, Magnetic Best. Variation East, Magnetic Least. Assuming a Ground Speed of 305 kt, which is equivalent to 305/60 NM/min, the time required to travel a distance of 300 NM can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance/Ground Speed In this case, the time would be (300 x 60) / 305 min = 59 min Given that the Time of Departure is 10:15 UTC and the estimated flight time is 59 min, the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) can be calculated as 10:15 UTC + 00:59 = 11:14 UTC.",

Therefore, we need to calculate the True Heading. To calculate the True Heading, both the Track and the Wind Direction must be referenced to the same North (either True or Magnetic). We will be converting the Track from Magnetic to True. By considering the provided magnetic variation: Variation = 5º W ⇒ Variation West, Magnetic Best ⇒ True Track = Magnetic Track - 005º = 007º - 005º = 002º. Given that True Track = 002º, TAS = 445 kt, and W/V: 050º/40 kt, we can use a flight computer to determine the true heading: Rotate the window disc until the True Wind Direction (050º) aligns below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Commencing from the center dot, draw an upward line along the centerline, with a length equivalent to the Wind Velocity (40 kt) - if you use TAS as reference, mark wind speed up from 445 kt, 485 kt. Rotate the window disc until the True Track (002º) falls below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Shift the slide until the center dot aligns with the arc corresponding to the True Airspeed (445 kt). Wind correction angle reads between centre line and Wind speed Mark => 4°R. 4ºR WCA means that the aircraft is experiencing a 4ºL drift. Therefore, Heading = Track + drift = 002°+ 004°= 006° Finally, applying the relationship above, we obtain: True Bearing from the aircraft to the Locator PY (at 1 003 UTC) = 266º + 006º = 272º.",

Thus, a distance of 500 NM along a meridian corresponds to 500' change of latitude or 8° 20'. Therefore, as it flies south on the northern hemisphere, its latitude will decrease, provided that it does not cross the Equator. Its new latitude at B point, after 500 NM south off A point, will be: 26°06'N - 8° 20' = 17°46'N. After B point, the aircraft continues eastwards (i.e. along the same parallel of latitude) for 500 NM along the 17°46'N parallel of latitude. The distance along a parallel of latitude is called \"Departure\" and is given by the formula: Departure(NM) = Change of Longitude(min) x cos Lat. Solving for Change of Longitude we get: Change of Longitude(min) = Departure(NM) / cos Lat = 500 NM / cos 17°46' = 525 or 8° 45'. Therefore, its new longitude, after 500 NM east off B point, will be: 004°11' + 8° 45' = 012°56' E. Finally, C position's coordinates will be: 17°46'N 012°56' E.",

CRP-5 flight computer: Adjust the window disc to position the True Heading (007º) below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Identify the Drift Angle by observing that the Drift Angle on the fixed scale opposite the True Track (022º) on the window disc is 15º right. Locate the point on the slide where the 15º Right Drift Angle intersects the arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (160 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline, positioning it BELOW the center dot. Calculate the Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the wind vector from the center dot to the pencil mark. Note that the center dot aligns with the arc for 165, while the pencil mark is on the arc for 122, resulting in a Wind Velocity of 43 kt (165-122=43). Determine the Wind Direction by identifying the value on the window disc aligned with the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. In this case, the value is 291º.",

The question provides a lot of data, but to find the True Airspeed (TAS), we only need the Ground Speed (GS) and the wind component. With a headwind, the TAS is higher than the GS because the wind is slowing you down. Therefore, you add the headwind component to the GS. With a tailwind, the TAS is lower than the GS because the wind is pushing you faster. Therefore, you subtract the tailwind component from the GS. Here's the formula to calculate TAS: TAS = GS ± Headwind/Tailwind Component - Use the plus sign if it’s a headwind (wind blowing against the direction of travel). - Use the minus sign if it’s a tailwind (wind blowing in the same direction as travel). Given: Ground Speed (GS) = 485 knots Headwind Component = 25 knots Since it's a headwind, you add the headwind component to the ground speed to find the TAS. TAS = GS + Headwind Component TAS = 485 kt + 25 kt TAS = 510 kt",

The interpolated values are approximately 191º/39 kt. While none of the available options precisely match these interpolated values, the most suitable choice from the provided answers would be 205º/40 kt for wind speed. To break down the interpolation: Interpolation: FL250: 190/40 FL180: 200/30 During a 7 000 ft descent (from 25 000 ft to 18 000 ft), the wind direction veered by 10º. Therefore, in a 500 ft interval, the wind would change by approximately 1º (191º). Similarly, during the same 7 000 ft descent, the wind speed decreased by 10 kt. Hence, in a 500 ft interval, the wind speed would decrease by roughly 1 kt (39 kt). Consequently, the most appropriate wind estimate, given these considerations, would be 205º/40 kt.",

Descent problems is the W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. 1. The aircaft climbs from 4 000 ft to 8 000 ft. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: [2/3 x (8 000 - 4 000)] ft + 4 000 ft= 6 667 ft. 2. With the data given, we cannot find the W/V at 4 000 ft and interpolate with the W/V at 8 000 ft for the 2/3 of the cruising altitude, but we can find through the flight/nav computer, the GS at 8 000 ft and interpolate with the GS given at 4 000 ft for the 2/3: Set wind direction to 200º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 240 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 259º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 241º with 8ºR drift. The groundspeed at 8 000 ft for this track is approximately 208 kt. 3. After interpolation, the GS at 2/3 of the cruising altitude (6 667 ft) is: 212 kt. 4. The time to climb from 4 000 ft to 8 000 ft is: Height difference / ROC = (8 000 ft - 4 000 ft) / 1 500 fpm = 2.67 min. 5. The Ground distance covered during the climb is: GS x Time = 212 kt x 2.67/60 hr = 9.434 NM.(9.4 is the closest)",

Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3.

When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true heading (265º) under the true index (5) Read the Groundspeed of 272 kt and a drift of 6ºR. Using drift angle and heading, determine track: Drift angle is how many degrees the heading is to the right or left of the track. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. Drift Angle: 6ºR True Track = True Heading + drift angle True Track = 265º + 6º = 271º",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 090º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 086º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 090º. This occurs at a heading of 094º with 5ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 130 kt. GS = 130 kts Planned track distance flown = 130 x 15 min = 32.5 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 32.5 + 2.5 = 35 NM. Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 35 TKE = 5° If we alter our heading by 5° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 5° + 12° = 17º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track).",

If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least The relationship between the different directions can be expressed by the following table: True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 356º 5ºW 001º 1ºW 002º Note: The TVMDC table can be used to relate both Heading directions or track directions.",

When a tailwind or headwind is experienced, the air distance will be affected, while the ground distance between the two points will remain the same.

At a height the air density reduces and therefore the same dynamic pressure reflects a higher TAS. The same thing would happen, if the air was warmer than standard. Conversely, at a lower height or in colder air than standard, the same dynamic presssure reflects a lower TAS. This means that at height we have two airspeeds, the CAS based on dynamic pressure and the higher TAS than CAS through the air. As an aircraft descends from one altitude to one other lower with constant CAS, but higher to Sea Level, the TAS will be in both cases higher than the CAS, but the difference between them increases as altitude increases and decreases as altitude decreases, until they become equal at Sea Level in ISA conditions. For this question, the TAS will be always higher than CAS during the descent (thus, 119 kt is excluded), but a few minutes later, after FL080, the TAS will be lower than 135 kt, 131 kt.",

Method using Flight/Nav computer: Rotate the disc until the OAT -49ºC is against the Mach Index. Below TAS 480 (48) kt on the outer scale, read Mach No 0.82 (82) on the inner scale.",

The Groundspeed can be found using your flight/nav computer and the W/V at FL140: Set wind direction to 260º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 150 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 300º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 14ºR drift and a track of 314º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 300º. This occurs at a heading of 286º with 10ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 113 kt.",

Based in the calculation of the position of airplane based in the direction and the ground distance traveled from a determined point. With the introduction of modern navigational techniques such as GPS and conventional radio navigational aids, this may seem outdated technique. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.
