            "explanation": "Magnetic Variation and Convergence of the Meridians Conventional magnetic compasses sense magnetic direction by detecting the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field. Since this horizontal component becomes very weak near the magnetic poles, magnetic compasses are highly unreliable near the poles. Within these areas, air navigation tasks are further complicated by very rapid changes in magnetic variation over small distances. For example, when flying between the magnetic North Pole and the true North Pole, a heading of true North results in a magnetic heading of South (a magnetic variation of 180 degrees). The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate system is such that all meridians converge to the pole. This convergence also presents additional directional complications. When flying a great circle courses at latitudes greater than 67º, convergence of the meridians can create rapid changes in true headings and true courses with small changes in aircraft position. As a result, relatively small errors in determining the aircraft's actual position can produce very large errors in determining the proper heading to fly and maintain the assigned flight path. When even small errors occur, very large navigation errors can develop over extremely short distances. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course can change several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantly altering the aircraft’s magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course.",

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 8 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADS-C and ADS-B transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly self-selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when non-normal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude-keeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as “Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)”",

Operations can increase the flight duty period by up to an hour if necessary, not more than 2 times per consecutive 7 days. Commanders can also use their discretion to extend the flight time up to 2 hours (3 hours with an augmented flight crew). However, this is where we run into the problem of the early report time. Due to the early report time being within the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL), between 02:00 and 05:59 hours, there are certain restrictions that occur to not only the flight duty period, but also any extensions. These restrictions become quite involved and complex, and do vary from operator to operator, so we cannot be sure precisely what extension EASA are allowing the commander to make using their discretion. We do know from EASA part ORO. FTL.205(f) that WOCL encroachment should be made part of any extension decision. The varying restrictions are not strong enough to reduce a 2 hour extension to 40 minutes only, so this leaves us only with the answer having the full 2 hours discretion, so 18:20 - 20:20 is the answer here For more information on flight duty period limitations and the WOCL see EASA part ORO.

In these circumstances, additional safety precautions are applied: The full number of cabin crew must be on board (the number corresponding to the minimum number of flight attendants for a flight). They must occupy their stations near the emergency exits (no catering handling, assisting passengers with baggage stowage, etc.). Passengers must be informed about fuelling in progress (by an on-board public address system and/or at the gate before boarding). The \"Fasten your seat belts\" sign must be switched off and passengers asked not to fasten their belts for quick evacuation. At least two escape paths depending on the size of the aircraft must be available (doors open with the bridge/airstairs connected or doors closed with an armed slide and the area below free from vehicles and objects for slide activation). Two-way communication maintained between personnel supervising refuelling and the cockpit for quick evacuation initiation. At most airports, fireman supervision or at least notification and monitoring through CCTV cameras is required. Such refuelling can only be done with low-risk fuels such as Jet A1. Wide-cute fuels and AVGAS are unsuitable due to their higher risk of ignition and hence can only be refuelled/de-fuelled if passengers are not on board, boarding nor disembarking.

Such ADS–C periodic reports, unlike event reports, contain wind and temperature data and thereby satisfy the MET authorities’ requirements for the provision of MET data. However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

Some systems will align in about 10 minutes, others can take 15 minutes or more; expect alignment to take longer in extreme cold or at higher latitudes or when the aircraft (and hence the inertial platform) is buffeted by winds or rocked during cargo loading. A rapid realignment feature is sometimes provided but should only be used if, during an intermediate stop, it becomes necessary to increase the system accuracy. The aircraft must be stationary during rapid realignment which typically will take about one minute. Since alignment of such systems can take some time, it is recommended to start the alignment process as soon as possible => for example, when the first person enters the cockpit.",

            "explanation": "CPDLC: Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications needs to LOGON prior to flight, which is the establishment of communications between the aircraft and ATC. This initial LOGON is considered a manual action, as the crew will need to input some data, such as the flight number. Once logged in, the CPDLC will now automatically transfer between ATC centres along the flight. It is only the initial LOGON that is manual. During flight, the crew will always have to select the new radio frequency when transiting between different ATC centres. In the NAT HLA this will be on HF radio, due to it's long range, which uses the 2.8 MHz to 18 MHz frequency band. Looking at the answers: 'The pilot is then required to contact Santa Maria Oceanic control using VHF radio in the 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz frequency band' --> INCORRECT. In the NAT HLA you will be using HF and not VHF due the ranges involved. 'Contact Santa Maria via radio communication, using HF radio in the 2.8 MHz to 18 MHz frequency band' --> CORRECT. As discussed above. 'You need to contact/log on with Santa Maria to confirm automatic change' --> INCORRECT. The logon on CPDLC will happen automatically, no pilot action is required. The pilot will need to select the correct HF radio frequency. 'Do nothing as contact via CPDLC is transferred automatically' --> INCORRECT. CPDLC will transfer automatically but the pilot still has to select the HF frequency for radio calls. The answer 'do nothing' is incorrect. NAT Doc 007 HF Voice Communications 6.1.3 Even with the growing use of data link communications a significant volume of NAT air/ground communications are conducted using voice on SSB HF frequencies and GP VHF frequencies. To support air/ground ATC communications in the North Atlantic region, twenty-four HF frequencies have been allocated, in bands ranging from 2.8 to 18 MHz. Additionally, Shanwick Radio, Santa Maria Radio, and Iceland Radio operate a number of Regional and Domestic Air Route Area (RDARA) frequencies in accordance with operating requirements and agreements between the stations. The integrity of the ATC service remains wholly dependent on establishing and maintaining HF or VHF voice communications with each ATS unit along the route of flight. Prior to or upon entering each NAT oceanic CTA, the flight crew should contact the appropriate aeronautical radio station.",

And Non-precision minima plus 200 ft /1 000 m” Incorrect => The question does not mention that the destination aerodrome is an isolated aerodrome. “Applicable precision approach procedure” means either CAT I or CAT II/III. According to Table 1 Planning Minima, the correct option should be: “NPA RVR/VIS, Ceiling shall be at or above MDH”. However, this is not an available answer. “RVR / visibility and ceiling at or above DH specified in accordance with AIR OPS, Part-CAT.” Incorrect => For this question to be correct, it must mention “NPA RVR/VIS” and “MDH” instead of “DH”. We are, therefore, left with only one available option: “RVR / visibility specified in accordance with AIR OPS, Part-CAT.” EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP. MPA.185 Planning minima for IFR flights — aeroplanes (a) Planning minima for a take-off alternate aerodrome The operator shall only select an aerodrome as a take-off alternate aerodrome when the appropriate weather reports and/or forecasts indicate that, during a period commencing one hour before and ending one hour after the estimated time of arrival at the aerodrome, the weather conditions will be at or above the applicable landing minima specified in accordance with CAT. OP. MPA.110. The ceiling shall be taken into account when the only approach operations available are non-precision approaches (NPA) and/or circling operations. Any limitation related to OEI operations shall be taken into account. (b) Planning minima for a destination aerodrome other than an isolated destination aerodrome The operator shall only select the destination aerodrome when: (1) the appropriate weather reports and/or forecasts indicate that, during a period commencing one hour before and ending one hour after the estimated time of arrival at the aerodrome, the weather conditions will be at or above the applicable planning minima as follows: (i) RVR/visibility (VIS) specified in accordance with CAT. OP. MPA.110; and (ii) for an NPA or a circling operation, the ceiling at or above MDH; or (2) two destination alternate aerodromes are selected. (c) Planning minima for a destination alternate aerodrome, isolated aerodrome, fuel en-route alternate (fuel ERA) aerodrome, en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome The operator shall only select an aerodrome for one of these purposes when the appropriate weather reports and/or forecasts indicate that, during a period commencing one hour before and ending one hour after the estimated time of arrival at the aerodrome, the weather conditions will be at or above the planning minima in Table 1.

An IRS sends it's data to the FMC for calculations. Therefore, the loss of an FMC means the loss of a LRNS. The Tango Routes, often referred to as the Three Sisters, are oceanic routes which are permanent and run north - south. As oceanic routes, they require 2 LRNS except for T9 and T290, which are close enough to shore to require only ONE LRNS. In this question, the failure of an FMC implies that the aircraft has only one LRNS remaining. As the aircraft is routing to the south, T9 is the only realistic option, other than to re-route via domestic airspace closer to shore. T9 is a south bound only track and T290 is north bound. Looking at the answers: 'Airway T16 may be used as planned since the aeroplane maintains Its navigation capability with the remaining FMS'. --> INCORRECT. T16 is further into the ocean and would need 2 LRNS. 'The aircraft should return to the departure aerodrome as flight with only one FMS means that NO redundancy exists and is forbidden'. --> INCORRECT. Flight is permitted with only 1 LRNS via T9, T290 or continuing via domestic airspace, ie, around the French coast. 'The pilots must request a reroute via T290 or T9 since the aeroplane has only one serviceable LRNS'. --> CORRECT. T9 requires only 1 LRNS and routes south bound as fits the scenario in the question. T290 is for north bound traffic but the examiner seems happy with this. 'The pilots must avoid NAT HLA since entry to NAT HLA is forbidden with only one serviceable LRNS'. --> INCORRECT. Flight in the NAT HLA is permitted with only 1 LRNS via T9 or T290.",

Friction generated as an aircraft moves through the air can cause a buildup of static electricity. The wick transfers that electricity back into the atmosphere to prevent it from interfering with navigation and communication radios. Static wicks dissipate precipitation static that can develop as you fly through areas of uncharged particles. These particles can exist as you fly through solid or liquid particles such as rain, snow, fog, dust or ash. As the airplane flies through the particles, positive charges deflect and negative charges attach to the airframe, building up and eventually discharging at certain points of the airframe where the static wicks are generally attached. Without the wicks, there is potential for audio disturbances, weak radio transmissions and even complete loss of communication.

Operators’ SOPs are generally consistent in regard to the importance of properly handing over, and taking control, and if adopted with due diligence, would forestall the development of an error. Note: The examiner seems to have chosen a very distinct use of English here, for the answer: 'The waypoints in the FMS are NOT correct and the FMS will provide Inaccurate guidance' The route should be changed towards PIKIL and track D. So, the current route is now wrong. The waypoints themselves are correct, you just need to amend the selection of waypoints. Saying the waypoints are not correct indicates that the waypoint is incorrectly labelled or positioned and there is a problem with the database. The FMS will provide accurate guidance as long as the pilot selects the appropriate waypoints to construct the desired route.",

            "explanation": "Lots of opportunity for confusion, so let's look at the phraseology needed for this exam: Skills Test: The flying test that completes training on a type rating course (with circuits to come). Licence Proficiency Check (LPC): Renewal of the type rating / IR - done every 12 months. Operator Proficiency Check (OPC): Effectively a mini IR and done between LPC's. The elements tested in an OPC are also done on the full LPC - so you end up doing 2 OPC's in every 12 months. For example: Complete the skills test and type rating 31st December. Now valid for 12 months. LPC must be done by the following 31st December, but can be done (for operational flexibility) anytime within 3 months prior to this date, ie in October, November or December. The new validity would be for 12 months from the original expiry though. Mid year, you will need to do an OPC. In this example, by 30th June. Again there is a 3 month window to complete this check, allowing for operational flexibility. Looking at the answer: 2 within a year, more than 3 months between checks --> CORRECT. You will do an OPC in mid year as it is valid for 6 months, and again as part of the annual LPC, so 2 in a year. Using the above example, it is possible to do the first OPC on the 30th June (at the latest) and then the second on the 1st October (at the earliest). There must always be at least 3 months between OPC's. Finally, regarding the OPC / 12 month questions: This relates ONLY TO SPECIALISED TASKS. For example, an operator is certified to carry out the spraying of detergent on oil slicks. This is clearly a specialised task as it involves low level flying and unique operating conditions. This skill is tested every year by the operator using an OPC. Here, the crew will have to fly a dummy run and demonstrate competency in this operation. Although this is also a check in proficiency by the operator (OPC), it is for a different skill set and by regulation, has a 12 month validity. More on this can be found below. Note: If the question mentions specialised tasks, the answer is 12 months. If not, then we are talking about the mini IR and so it's 6 months and 2 in a year. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) 2015/140 ORO. FC.230 Recurrent training and checking (a) Each flight crew member shall complete recurrent training and checking relevant to the type or variant of aircraft on which they operate. (b) Operator proficiency check (1) Each flight crew member shall complete operator proficiency checks as part of the normal crew complement to demonstrate competence in carrying out normal, abnormal and emergency procedures. (2) When the flight crew member will be required to operate under IFR, the operator proficiency check shall be conducted without external visual reference, as appropriate. (3) The validity period of the operator proficiency check shall be six calendar months. For operations under VFR by day of performance class B aeroplanes conducted during seasons not longer than eight consecutive months, one operator proficiency check shall be sufficient. The proficiency check shall be undertaken before commencing commercial air transport operations. EASA AIR OPS ORO. FC.330 Recurrent training and checking — operator proficiency check (a) Each flight crew member shall complete recurrent training and operator proficiency checks. In the case of specialised operations, the recurrent training and checking shall cover the relevant aspects associated with the specialised tasks described in the operations manual. (b) Appropriate consideration shall be given when operations are undertaken under IFR or at night. (c) The validity period of the operator proficiency check shall be 12 calendar months.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: We have received feedback that confirms the current correct option. Nevertheless, we aim to gather additional feedback to ensure absolute accuracy regarding the correct option. Therefore, if you encounter this question in your official exam, kindly inform us for further assessment. When a cabin crew member is detected with the smell of alcohol during the briefing, it is important for the commander to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of the flight. Option b) suggests asking the authorities to check the crew member's blood alcohol levels to determine if they are under the legal limit. This action is necessary because alcohol impairs cognitive and physical abilities, which can affect the crew member's performance and judgment during the flight. Flight safety is of paramount importance, and having a crew member under the influence of alcohol poses risks to the operation and the well-being of passengers. It is important to consider that certain medical conditions can lead to the smell of alcohol. For example, if your blood sugar remains consistently high for an extended period, it may cause your breath to have an odor resembling alcohol. Therefore, obtaining an accurate assessment is crucial to determine the actual cause of the smell and ensure appropriate actions are taken. By involving the authorities to conduct a blood alcohol test, the commander can obtain an objective and accurate assessment of the crew member's condition. This ensures that any decision made regarding their participation in the flight is based on factual information rather than subjective observations. If the crew member is found to have exceeded the legal limit for alcohol consumption, denying them access to the aircraft is crucial to maintain flight safety. It is essential to have a sober and alert crew to handle any emergencies or challenges that may arise during the flight. EASA AIR OPS GM1 NCC. GEN.105(e)(2) Crew responsibilities GENERAL In accordance with 7.g. of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 216/20081 (essential requirements for air operations), a crew member must not perform duties on board an aircraft when under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol or when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness or other similar causes.

You could be flying, in the sim, in ground school, doing office work, positioning etc. Flight duty time: Starts when you report to the reporting point (normally in the ops room) and continues until a certain time after flight (typically 30 minutes after parking on stand is allowed for completing the tech log, etc). ‘Flight time’: the time between an aircraft first moving from its parking place for the purpose of taking off until it comes to rest on the designated parking position and all engines or propellers are shut down. You need to know the flight time as it is the basis for determining the end of the flight duty and thus also the duty periods. Note: Flight duty time is an example of a duty time. Looking at the incorrect answers: Airborne time --> INCORRECT. This is the time from take-off until landing. If a flight is to be considered a cross-country flight --> INCORRECT. Cross country flights are any flight beyond a certain distance from the departure airfield. When the MEL cannot be applied --> INCORRECT. The MEL is intended to be used when parked on the ground and then the abnormal and emergency check lists are to used when the aircraft is in motion. However, the extent of the MEL states that it can be considered by the commander at any time to enhance situational awareness and safety decisions. More information can be found here: ICAO Annex 6 Chapter. Definitions Duty. Any task that flight or cabin crew members are required by the operator to perform, including, for example, flight duty, administrative work, training, positioning and standby when it is likely to induce fatigue. Flight time - aeroplanes. The total time from the moment an aeroplane first moves for the purpose of taking-off until the moment it finally comes to rest at the end of the flight. Flight duty period. A period which commences when a flight or cabin crew member is required to report for duty that includes a flight or a series of flights and which finishes when the aircraft finally comes to rest and the engines are shut down at the end of the last flight on which he/she is a crew member.",

It is therefore expected that continuous monitoring of the serviceability of the aircraft’s height keeping systems will have been undertaken. Nevertheless, in view of the significant change of operating environment (i.e. to indirect surveillance and communications) it is recommended that a final confirmation of the aircraft systems serviceability is performed immediately prior to entering the NAT HLA. Check to ensure the two primary altimeters are reading within 200 feet of each other (or lesser value if specified in your aircraft’s flight manual). Conduct this check while at level flight. You should also note the stand-by altimeter reading. The readings of the primary and standby altimeters should be recorded to be available for use in any possible contingency situations.",

The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: (.) 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or Note: Descent below FL 290 is considered particularly applicable to operations where there is a predominant traffic flow (e.g. east-west) or parallel track system where the aircraft’s diversion path will likely cross adjacent tracks or routes. A descent below FL 290 can decrease the likelihood of: conflict with other aircraft, ACAS RA events and delays in obtaining a revised ATC clearance. b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.",

The regulations require an evacuation to use at least 50% of the exits. The use of an air-bridge or stairs allows for evacuation, otherwise the area must be clear for slide deployment. This allows the right hand side of the aircraft to be used for refueling, baggage loading, loading of catering etc, which blocks some evacuation areas. 'All flight crew remain at their station.' --> INCORRECT. The minimum required number of cabin crew should be on board and be prepared for an immediate emergency evacuation, but there is no need for all flight crew to be at their station. 'The fire brigade truck is close to the aircraft, ready for fire fighting.' --> INCORRECT. The fire brigade do not attend an aircraft refueling during normal operations. At major airports in particular, this would require a lot of fire trucks! 'All the aircraft doors are completely open.' --> INCORRECT. 50% of the exits must be available, not all doors being open. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 AMC1 CAT. OP.

(b) The deployment of integral aircraft stairs or the opening of emergency exits as a prerequisite to refueling is not necessarily required. OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES — AEROPLANES (c) Operational procedures should specify that at least the following precautions are taken: (1) one qualified person should remain at a specified location during fueling operations with passengers on board. This qualified person should be capable of handling emergency procedures concerning fire protection and firefighting, handling communications, and initiating and directing an evacuation; (2) two-way communication should be established and should remain available by the aeroplane's inter-communication system or other suitable means between the ground crew supervising the refueling and the qualified personnel on board the aeroplane; the involved personnel should remain within easy reach of the system of communication; (3) crew, personnel and passengers should be warned that re/defueling will take place; (4) ‘Fasten Seat Belts’ signs should be off; (5) ‘NO SMOKING’ signs should be on, together with interior lighting to enable emergency exits to be identified; (6) passengers should be instructed to unfasten their seat belts and refrain from smoking; (7) the minimum required number of cabin crew should be on board and be prepared for an immediate emergency evacuation; (8) if the presence of fuel vapour is detected inside the aeroplane, or any other hazard arises during re/defueling, fuelling should be stopped immediately; (9) the ground area beneath the exits intended for emergency evacuation and slide deployment areas should be kept clear at doors where stairs are not in position for use in the event of evacuation; and (10) provision is made for a safe and rapid evacuation.",

            "explanation": "Let's run the scenario to explain this: An aeroplane is en route to the oceanic entry point BEGAS. About 40 minutes before reaching the ocean, you need to call for an Oceanic clearance. 40 minutes away from the ocean means you are somewhere over the UK, France etc. You call for this oceanic clearance on comms 2. You are working the European domestic controller (British, French etc.) on comms 1. Your oceanic clearance is to enter via point BERUX. This is a clearance to enter the oceanic airspace at this point only. The oceanic controller does not control you until you enter their airspace, some 40 minutes away. You now need to speak with domestic ATC on comms 1, to request a re-clearance to turn towards BERUX. Looking at the answers: 'Request and obtain a re-clearance from ATC to fly to BERUX' --> CORRECT. As described above. 'Fly to BEGAS, and when reaching BEGAS fly on to BERUX' --> INCORRECT. Flying to BEGAS and then along the oceanic boundary to BERUX is a waste of time and fuel. 'Turn towards BERUX 5 minutes before reaching BEGAS' --> INCORRECT. This is a randomly made up time. In reality, you would look to turn sooner to save track miles by obtaining the re-clearance from the domestic ATC. 'Programme the FMS to fly direct to BERUX from the way-point BEGAS' ---> INCORRECT. As with another answer, flying to BEGAS and then along the oceanic boundary to BERUX is a waste of time and fuel. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL CHAPTER 5: OCEANIC ATC CLEARANCES 5.1.8 If any of the route, flight level or Mach Number in the clearance differs from that flight planned, requested or previously cleared, attention may be drawn to such changes when the clearance is delivered (whether by voice or by data link). Pilots should pay particular attention when the issued clearance differs from the Flight Plan. (N. B. a significant proportion of navigation errors investigated in the NAT involve an aircraft which has followed its Flight Plan rather than its differing clearance). 5.1.9 Furthermore it must be recognised that if the entry point of the oceanic route on which the flight is cleared differs from that originally requested and/or the oceanic flight level differs from the current flight level, the pilot is responsible for requesting and obtaining the necessary domestic re-clearance to ensure that the flight is in compliance with its Oceanic Clearance when entering oceanic airspace.",

This question references Learning Objective 071.01.02.02.07 which states: 'Explain which are the operator requirements regarding the management system.' An operator is considered non-complex or complex depending on the size and scale of the operation. One of the important aspects of this distinction, is the requirement for management structure. For example, a start up company with one owner / pilot and one aircraft is clearly non-complex and the owner / pilot will have to fulfil many of the management functions. A large, complex company such as Air France, British Airways etc will require a very different management structure covering areas such as flight operations ground operations maintenance training AMC1 ORO. GEN.200(b) Management system SIZE, NATURE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTIVITY (a) An operator should be considered as complex when it has a workforce of more than 20 full time equivalents (FTEs) involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200848 and its Implementing Rules. (b) Operators with up to 20 FTEs involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200849 and its Implementing Rules may also be considered complex based on an assessment of the following factors: (1) in terms of complexity, the extent and scope of contracted activities subject to the approval; (2) in terms of risk criteria, the extent of the following: (i) operations requiring a specific approval; (ii) high-risk commercial specialised operations; (iii) operations with different types of aircraft used; and (iv) operations in challenging environment (offshore, mountainous area, etc.).",

As prevailing visibility is usually used, which is approximately the average visibility in all directions from the station, this can be a bit inaccurate, as the visibility can vary massively between two different directions, due to different density of obscuration, perhaps. This is why, when the visibility is below 1500 m, the RVR is reported also, as the RVR (Runway Visual Range) is a measure of the exact visibility directly down the runway, and usually is measured at 3 different places on the runway, touchdown zone, midpoint, and stop-end. This is almost always higher than the prevailing visibility, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers). In terms of this question, the runway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of centreline markings or lights that can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so those two answers must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is the runway edge lights, which you should be able to see also. The other options are either to the side of the runway (in a direction where visibility is not assured), or behind the aircraft when lined up.",

            "explanation": "PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM The cabin’s fixed oxygen system supplies oxygen to the occupants, in case of cabin depressurization. Most air transport aircraft use Chemical generators to provide passengers with oxygen (Boeings use gaseous). Generators and masks are in containers above the passenger seats, in the lavatories, in each galley, and at each cabin crew station. OPERATION For Chemical Oxygen Systems, each container has an electrical latching mechanism that opens automatically to allow the masks to drop, if the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15 000 ft. The flight crew can override the automatic control. A manual release tool allows crewmembers to manually open the doors in case of electrical failure. The generation of oxygen begins when the passenger pulls the mask towards the passenger seat. Once the generator is activated, the flow of oxygen is constant (whether or not the mask is being worn) for approximately 15 minutes, until the generator is exhausted. In line with the oxygen supply to the passenger mask, there is a small bag. This should partially inflate during use, indicating that there is a supply of oxygen. A mixture of oxygen together with cabin air will be supplied. Thus the masks will not protect the passenger from smoke and fumes. The chemical reaction used for oxygen generation creates heat (the generator itself incorporates a heat shield). Therefore, the smell of burning or smoke, and cabin temperature increase, may be associated with the normal operation of the oxygen generators.",

II - ARO - requirements for the national authorities. III - ORO - how an operator is organised, management structure, safety management etc IV - CAT - how an operator carriers out commercial air transport, ie. the carrying of passengers and freight. V - SPA - specific approvals for ETOPs, Dangerous Goods, Low Visibility Operations etc VI - NCC - non commercial with complex aircraft, operating private jets etc. VII - NCO - non commercial with non complex aircraft, operating a Piper Warrior for example VII - SPA - specialised operations for aerial work, such as pollution spraying, banner towing, crop spraying etc. For a commercial airline, annexes III, IV and V are the most relevant. If the operator plans on carrying dangerous goods (DG) then all 3 annexes contain relevant information to obtain this approval. Note: Sometimes the question simply mixes up the annexes, for example giving annex III as ARO instead of ORO. Knowledge of the annexes as shown above will enable you to avoid these mistakes.

            "explanation": "There are 2 aspects to be clear on, in order to answer this question: 1. After take-off, the requirement is to use the operating minima only. The ceiling is taken into account only for ETOPS, Non-Precision & Circling approaches in planning minima. The following table is a summary for the application of planning and operating minima. Stage of flight? Pre-flight (in the ops room) Dispatch / taxiing After take-off / en-route Which minima? Planning minima Planning minima Operating minima Time? +/- 1 hour ETA ETA Operating minima is Visibility / RVR only. 2. Continuation of approach: Under European regulations, you can always commence an approach. However, to continue the approach below the outer marker (not below 1000 ft above the aerodrome) then the reported visibility / RVR must be the same or greater than what is required for the approach. For example: you are flying a CAT I ILS, with a DH of 200 ft and an RVR of 550 m. On the approach, ATC report RVR 400 m - you may not descend below 1000 ft. If they report RVR 600 m, then you may descend below 1000 ft agl and continue down to DH. At DH, further descent is based on seeing the required visual references. The idea behind this regulation is to prevent low approaches in visibility conditions that will likely result in a go-around. Cloud base and ceiling are not a factor - only visibility / RVR. Note: Once below 1000 ft agl, if the visibility / RVR now decreases to below minima, then you can continue down to DH anyway. In this question - you are flying a non-precision approach, but the ceiling / MDH are not relevant as you are using operating minima. The reported visibility of 1800 m exceeds your required 1500 m so you may continue down to minimums. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP. MPA.305 Commencement and continuation of approach (a) The commander or the pilot to whom conduct of the flight has been delegated may commence an instrument approach regardless of the reported RVR/VIS. (b) If the reported RVR/VIS is less than the applicable minimum the approach shall not be continued: (1) below 1 000 ft above the aerodrome; or (2) into the final approach segment in the case where the DA/H or MDA/H is more than 1 000 ft above the aerodrome. (c) Where the RVR is not available, RVR values may be derived by converting the reported visibility. (d) If, after passing 1 000 ft above the aerodrome, the reported RVR/VIS falls below the applicable minimum, the approach may be continued to DA/H or MDA/H. (e) The approach may be continued below DA/H or MDA/H and the landing may be completed provided that the visual reference adequate for the type of approach operation and for the intended runway is established at the DA/H or MDA/H and is maintained. (f) The touchdown zone RVR shall always be controlling. If reported and relevant, the midpoint and stop end RVR shall also be controlling. The minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 125 m or the RVR required for the touchdown zone if less, and 75 m for the stop end. For aircraft equipped with a roll out guidance or control system, the minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 75 m",

The problem is that the weather at the destination in Milan is below minima. With Milan below minima, the commander must find 2 destination alternates where the weather is above the planning minima. Note: If the destination aerodrome is below minima, some operators will elect to delay the flight. However, by regulation the aircraft can depart if 2 alternate airfields meet the planning minima. This would mean a likely divert, but may be the choice of an operator. The following table is a summary for the application of planning and operating minima. Stage of flight? Pre-flight (in the ops room) Dispatch / taxiing After take-off / en-route Which minima? Planning minima Planning minima Operating minima Time? +/- 1 hour ETA ETA This question states 'the pilot may not take-off'. This is describing an aircraft that has dispatched, is off stand and now taxiing, but is yet to depart. Planning minima remains in effect but now the crew have an accurate ETA, and so this is used, rather than the +/- one hour of the pre-flight planning stage.

(b) On IFR flights, the commander shall only continue towards the planned destination aerodrome when the latest information available indicates that, at the expected time of arrival, the weather conditions at the destination, or at least one destination alternate aerodrome, are at or above the applicable aerodrome operating minima.",

Should the radio altimeter fail during the autoland procedure, the height indication is removed and replaced by a warning flag. As the individual steps of the automatic landing procedure are triggered by radio heights, this situation requires the aircraft to go around and be landed manually. ED Decision 2022/012/R - AMC2 SPA. LVO.100(b) Low-visibility operations and operations with operational credits INSTRUMENT APPROACH OPERATIONS IN LOW-VISIBILITY CONDITIONS — CAT III OPERATIONS For CAT III operations, the following should apply: (a) For operations in which a DH is used, the DH should be determined by the use of a radio altimeter or other device capable of providing equivalent performance and be not lower than: (1) the minimum DH specified in the AFM, if stated; (2) the DH to which the flight crew is qualified to operate.

            "explanation": "This question has similarities with other questions. Be careful to understand exactly what it is asking. Accountable Manager: Holds ultimate responsibility and authority for the safety and compliance of the operator. Safety Manager: Manages the day to day operation and effectiveness of the operator's Safety Management System (SMS). Here we are asked who would be the post-holder responsible for the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programme. This is describing the safety manager. The safety manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SMS safety management system, which includes FDM. For a smaller operator (Non complex) this is typically the accountable manager or a line Captain. Both of these positions offer sufficient relevant experience in operational roles to be an effective safety manager. For a larger operator (Complex) this position would now need a more dedicated specialist due to the size or type of operation. Now the operator will need a safety manager and safety review board. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) 2015/1329 ORO. AOC.130 Flight data monitoring – aeroplanes (a) The operator shall establish and maintain a flight data monitoring programme, which shall be integrated in its management system, for aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-off mass of more than 27 000 kg. (b) The flight data monitoring programme shall be non-punitive and contain adequate safeguards to protect the source(s) of the data. AMC1 ORO. AOC.130 Flight data monitoring – aeroplanes FLIGHT DATA MONITORING (FDM) PROGRAMME (a) The safety manager, as defined under AMC1-ORO. GEN.200(a)(1), should be responsible for the identification and assessment of issues and their transmission to the manager(s) responsible for the process(es) concerned. The latter should be responsible for taking appropriate and practicable safety action within a reasonable period of time that reflects the severity of the issue.",

To assist the OAC in pre-planning optimum airspace utilisation, when requesting an oceanic clearance the pilot should notify the OAC of the maximum acceptable flight level possible at the boundary, taking into account that a climb to the assigned oceanic flight level must be achieved prior to entering oceanic airspace and normally whilst the aircraft is within radar coverage. The pilot should also notify the OAC of any required change to the oceanic flight planned level, track or Mach Number as early as practical after departure. If requesting an OTS track, the clearance request should include the next preferred alternative track. 5.1.12. An example of a pilot voice request for Oceanic Clearance is as follows: “ACA 865 request Oceanic Clearance. Estimating PIKIL at 1131. Request Mach decimal eight zero, Flight Level three five zero, able Flight Level three six zero, second choice Track Charlie”. 5.1.13. If the request also includes a change to the original flight plan, affecting the oceanic segment, then it should be according to the following example: “BAW 123 request Oceanic Clearance.

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1)aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2)the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3)the direction to an alternate airport; 4)any strategic lateral offset being flown and, 5)terrain clearance 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK If possible maintain the assigned flight level until established on the 9.3 km (5.0 NM) parallel, same direction track or route offset. If unable, initially minimize the rate of descent to the extent that is operationally feasible. 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.

The effect of these flows is to concentrate most of the traffic uni-directionally, with peak westbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 1130 UTC and 1900 UTC and peak eastbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 0100 UTC and 0800 UTC. 2.1.2 The flight levels normally associated with the OTS are FL310 to FL400 inclusive. These flight levels, and their use have been negotiated and agreed by the NATS ATS providers and are published as the Flight Level Allocation Scheme (FLAS). (See Attachment 5). The FLAS also determines flight levels available for traffic routing partly or wholly outside of the OTS as well as flights operating outside of the valid time periods of the OTS; often referred to as “transition times’. 2.1.3 The hours of validity of the two Organised Track Systems (OTS) are as follows: (Westbound) Day-time OTS 1130 UTC to 1900 UTC at 30°W (Eastbound) Night-time OTS 0100 UTC to 0800 UTC at 30°W",

Flight crews intending to fly on a random route or outside the OTS time periods may plan any flight level(s) in accordance with the NAT FLAS. Note: The FLAS is published in the UK and Canadian AIPs and described in Attachment 5. 4.1.11 Flights which are planned to follow an OTS track for its entire length (during the OTS periods) may plan any of the levels published for that track, keeping in mind PBCS and DLM requirements. Note: PBCS tracks will be identified in Note 3 of the OTS message. Operators planning to operate in the altitude band FL350-390 on the PBCS OTS are subject to equipage and authorization requirements as outlined in NAT OPS Bulletin, “Implementation of Performance Based Separation Minima”. 4.1.12 Operators may include climbs in the flight plan, although each change of level during flight must be requested from ATC by the flight crew. Approval of such requests will be entirely dependent upon potential traffic conflicts. ATC may not always be able to accommodate requested flight level changes and prudent pre-flight fuel planning should take this into consideration",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Once the descent has been initiated, it is standard procedure to confirm that all required actions have been completed by referring to the appropriate checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and an emergency shall be declared. It is most important to emphasize that crew protection must be the highest of priorities.

            "explanation": "Looking at the answer options: 1. High wind velocity --> CORRECT. This can disturb the anti-icing fluid or even blow it off the aircraft. 2. Light wind velocity --> INCORRECT. Light or calm winds will not disturb the protective fluid. 3. Ambient temperature above 0 degrees Celsius --> INCORRECT. Warm temperatures are good news for hold over times. 4. High relative humidity --> CORRECT. The higher the water content of the air, the more contamination on the aircraft as it cools on the surface. 5. Aeroplane skin temperature above the ambient temperature --> INCORRECT. If the aircraft is warmer than ambient, this will discourage contamination. Be careful, a cold soaked wing is detrimental to hold over time, as an aircraft following a long cruise will have a very cold skin and low temperature fuel in the tanks. 6. Low concentration of anti-icing fluid in the anti-icing fluid/water mix --> CORRECT. The more the anti-icing fluid is diluted, then the less effective it is. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.2 HOT is the estimated time the anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of ice and frost and the accumulation of snow on the protected (treated) surfaces of an aeroplane. These HOTs are generated by testing fluids under a variety of temperature and precipitation conditions that simulate the range of weather experienced in winter. 4.3 Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the ACAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during an ACAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. When there is a collision danger between two aircraft, the ACAS systems of these aircraft will inform the pilots in the form of Resolution Advisory (RA) giving them instructions to follow. The ACAS systems of the two aircraft are communicating with each other in order to provide the pilots with non-contradicting instructions (i.e one aircraft may instructed to climb and the other to descend). The ATC is usually unaware of the onset of a Resolution Advisory (RA) and the respective instructions given to the pilots. That is the reason why after following the Resolution Advisory (RA), the pilot shall notify the ATC as soon as possible. Note: After the response to an ACAS RA is completed, a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated. (ICAO Doc 4444)",

A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing engine trouble.

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

            "explanation": "Ground de-icing / anti-icing can be carried out either in one stage or two stages. De-icing is reactive, removing icing. Anti-icing is pro-active, stopping it from forming later on. One stage de-icing / anti-icing is where heated anti-icing fluid is applied to the aircraft surfaces; the heat de-ices the aircraft, and the fluid remains on the aircraft to provide sufficient anti-icing capability. The holdover time begins at the start of the single stage. Two stage de-icing / anti-icing means that the first stage applies a dedicated de-icing fluid, and then the second stage applies a dedicated anti-icing fluid. The holdover time begins at the start of the second (anti-icing) stage. The given holdover time is the time that the aircraft is sufficiently clear of icing and contaminants for, and if the aircraft does not take off within this time, they must return to be de-iced / anti-iced again. It is usually found using a table, and depends on variables like temperature, type and severity of precipitation, type and concentration of fluids used.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "Because the wear mechanisms are different between carbon and steel brakes, different taxi braking techniques are recommended for carbon brakes in order to maximize brake life. Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear. Landing with a tailwind will increase the landing distance, since the runway length is limited, it requires greater brake energy. Wear mechanisms are different between carbon and steel brakes. In carbon brakes, one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications but in steel brakes, maximum lifetime can be achieved by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for cooling between applications. From this point of view, using carbon brakes when landing with a tailwind is more favorable.",

            "explanation": "A difficult question as there are 2 possible scenarios being asked: 1. The formation of the vortex - outward along the span under the wing, then upwards around the wingtip towards the lower pressure above the wing. 2. The path of the vortices once formed - outwards and downwards from the wing tips, descending typically 1000 ft over 3 minutes before dissipating. Feedback over several years confirms the examiner is asking about the first scenario - the formation of the vortices. WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off.

WINDSHEAR ESCAPE There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

NADP 1 prioritises noise abatement for areas close to the airport, by keeping the take-off flap/slat setting the same until 3000ft, but doing a thrust reduction at or above 800ft (can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). The aircraft only accelerates to remove flaps when 3000ft has been reached, as the act of accelerating the aircraft reduces the climb gradient, which makes the aircraft closer to the ground in a potentially noise sensitive zone. NADP 2 prioritses noise abatement for areas further from the airport, by doing a flap reduction and acceleration at 800ft (or slightly above) then reducing power immediately after that has occurred. This procedure does remove flaps and slats early, and allows acceleration to a better climb speed, which allows the aircraft to gain a better average rate of climb for noise abatement further from the aerodrome. Note: Thrust reduction occurs at or above 800ft, as stated above, it can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). However, acceleration occurs only when 3 000 ft has been reached (not before). The option \"Reduce thrust at 800 ft and accelerate.\" suggests that at 800 ft, the aircraft will accelerate, which is incorrect.",

Learning objective 071.02.02.01.05: Interpret the guidelines for fluid holdover times and list the factors which can reduce the fluid protection time. Source: ICAO Doc 9640 ‘Manual of Aircraft Ground De-icing/Anti-icing Operations’, Chapter 5: 5.1, 5.2 and Attachment ( 5 tables) ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.2 - HOT is the estimated time the anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of ice and frost and the accumulation of snow on the protected (treated) surfaces of an aeroplane. These HOTs are generated by testing fluids under a variety of temperature and precipitation conditions that simulate the range of weather experienced in winter. 4.3 - Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. Some further explanation can be gained from studying the example guideline table for holdover times, which includes differences due to OAT, fluid/water ratio, cold-soaked wings (skin temperature lower than ambient), etc.",

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

There is no requirement for it to be used for passengers, however, it must still be available. The amount of supplemental oxygen to be carried depends on whether the aircraft is pressurised, in which case its use is in emergency only, or unpressurised, where the amount has to correspond to the length of flight planned above these altitudes. In this case, the aircraft is above 13 000 ft at the moment, so supplementary oxygen is required continuously, but when the aircraft descends below 13 000 ft, the flight crew will only be obliged to use it after 30 minutes at that level. For pressurized aircraft, the following amount is required: For flight crew: The entire flying time when the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 13 000 ft. The remainder of the flying time when the cabin pressure altitude is between 10 000 ft and 13 000 ft after the initial 30 minutes at these altitudes, but in no case less than: • 30 minutes' supply for aeroplanes certified to fly at altitudes not exceeding 25 000 ft. • 2 hours' supply for aeroplanes certified to fly at altitudes of more than 25 000 ft. For unpressurized aircraft, the following amount is required: For flight crew: The entire flying time at pressure altitudes above 10 000 ft.",

Regular observations on thirteen airfields showed that birds were fewer and occurred less frequently on long grass (15 - 20 cm) than on short grass (5 - 10 cm) areas. The growing of long grass does not eliminate birds but generally reduces numbers and is therefore an effective component of bird control measures on airfields.

A reduction in thrust to increase the rate of descent and/or a change in pitch attitude may counter this. - A downdraught that increases the rate of descent and decreases the IAS, thereby causing the aircraft to drop further below the glidepath. The situation worsens if the nose is still high and the thrust setting low. To counter this, power is re-applied, but with transport-category aircraft, the thrust does not increase instantaneously because the engines take time to speed up and the IAS continues to fall. - On leaving the downdraught, increasing tail winds cause a further reduction in IAS (Temporary Energy Loss). The rate of descent may lessen due to increased thrust availability. To counter this: - Apply full power whilst increasing pitch attitude rapidly and smoothly, but not aggressively, and consider pulling full backstick, if necessary, to minimize height loss - Do not change the configuration (except speed brakes), until the aircraft is out of the windshear, because operating the landing gear doors causes additional drag A successful recovery from a microburst encounter depends on the altitude, thrust, and speed reserves available. In addition to these effects, severe wind, turbulence, heavy rain, and blinding flashes of lightning often accompany microbursts.",

The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. In calm air, the vortices remain parallel behind the aircraft and descend slowly. For aircraft flying along the same route or approach path, calm wind increases the chances of flying into the vortices of preceding traffic. Wake encounter could cause catastrophic inflight structural damage to an aircraft. The usual hazard is associated with induced rolling moments that can exceed the roll-control authority of the encountering aircraft. During inflight testing, aircraft intentionally flew directly up trailing vortex cores of larger aircraft. These tests demonstrated that the ability of aircraft to counteract the roll imposed by wake vortex depends primarily on the wingspan and counter-control responsiveness of the encountering aircraft. These tests also demonstrated the difficulty of an aircraft to remain within a wake vortex. The natural tendency is for the circulation to eject aircraft from the vortex.",

            "explanation": "How To Cope With Wind Shear Here are the best ways a pilot can prevent a hazardous encounter with wind shear: • Know wind shear is there. • Know the magnitude of the change. • Be prepared to correct or go around immediately. WINDSHEAR ESCAPE There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

At the wing tip the high pressure air flips over to the low pressure air, and this creates the rotational element of the vortex. The more lift is generated at the wing tip, the stronger the vortex will be. In a clean configuration, the higher lift requirement is fullfield by a higher angle of attack.

Please read the real question carefully and consider all the options. Do let us know if you come across this one in the exam so we can verify it, thank you! Cold-Soaked Fuel Frost (CSFF) The wings of aircraft are said to be “cold-soaked” when they contain very cold fuel as a result of having just landed after a flight at high altitude or from having been re-fuelled with very cold fuel. Whenever precipitation falls on a cold-soaked aircraft when on the ground, clear icing may occur. Even in ambient air temperatures up to +15°C, ice or frost can form in the presence of visible moisture or high humidity if the aircraft structure remains at 0°C or below. The following factors contribute to cold-soaking: temperature and quantity of fuel in fuel tanks, type and location of fuel tanks, length of time at high altitude, temperature of re-fuelled fuel and time since re-fuelling. In this question, it may be useful to go through each option: \"Your pitot tubes will become blocked.\" Pitot tubes can be heated so ice does not block them. \"Icing will appear on the wings when the OAT is below 0ºC.\" Whilst this can happen, cold-soaked fuel frost is very common at outside air temperatures above 0ºC, so this is not fully correct. \"Icing may appear on the wings if the wing temperature is below 0ºC.\" This is absolutely true. If the wing temperature is lower than 0ºC, cold-soaked fuel frost may occur from the high humidity in the air accreting directly to the cold wing surface through the process of deposition (sublimation if you are American). \"Icing will appear on the wings when the fuel temperature is above 0ºC.\" Whilst the skin temperature of the wing can be different from the fuel temperature, they are often very close together, and the wing skin temperature needs to be below 0ºC for CSFF to occur.",

This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

This version states that \"all radios were destroyed.\" With this in mind, let's examine the answer options: Try to contact ATC via CPDLC. There is more information on CPDLC below, but this is certainly one of it's functions. Assuning that the CPDLC is not included in \"all radios\" being destroyed then this is the correct answer. Try to contact ATC via ADS-B. ADS is for reporting aircraft position etc, not for communications. It does have an emergency function however, so is a possible answer, but is not as strong an option here as using CPDLC. You should not contact ATC. Obviously you should try to, being able to in this situation is something else. Try to squawk \"7600\" on your mode A transponder. 2 things here: 7600 is for radio problems, which you certainly have but squawking \"7500\" for unlawful interference or indeed \"7700\" for emergency would be better options. Secondly, were the transponders destroyed as part of \"all radios\"? If not, it's still a wrong answer due to the choice of squawk code. CPDLC is covered fully in the Instruments syllabus but here is more information… Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) using the FANS 1/A network has become the primary means of communicating with ATC in oceanic regions around the world and is also implemented in several domestic regions as well. One function of FANS CPDLC no crew ever wants to have to use is emergency reporting. During an emergency, the flight crew would normally revert to voice communications. However, the crew may use CPDLC for emergency communications if it is either more expedient or if voice contact cannot be established.",

Quickly identifying the source and taking prompt action significantly reduces the risk of an onboard fire. The main priorities are: Identify the source of the smoke. Rapidly assess the situation. Take immediate action to access fires that may be behind interior panels. Land as soon as possible at the nearest suitable aerodrome. One of the first signs of a hidden fire could be smoke coming from areas that are not easily accessible, such as sidewalls, overhead panels, air ducts, ceiling panels, or cargo compartments. These areas often have limited or no access, making monitoring difficult or even impossible. Smoke from these hidden areas is a serious warning sign. Given that the question already indicates there is no visible source, it is crucial for the crew to immediately inform the Captain. For example, smoke escaping from the seams of a wall panel could indicate electrical arcing that has ignited nearby material. In such cases, the pilots must quickly isolate any related electrical systems and plan to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome.

EASA is referring to a micro-burst when they say \"downdraft\". A micro-burst is a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm. For these questions involving wind shear and micro-bursts, the scenario can be considered in 3 parts: Position 1 on the figure: An increasing head wind which increases the energy of the aircraft. The airspeed increases and the aircraft floats up above the flight profile. Position 2 on the figure: The aircraft now flies under the wind shear / micro-burst. The previous headwind decreases and the airspeed decreases. The aircraft now sinks due to the loss of energy and also the down draft. The angle of attack will decrease as the relative airflow is now coming from a higher orientation. Position 3 on the figure: The aircraft leaves the down draft but now encounters an increasing tail wind. This steals more energy and the airspeed decreases and the aircraft sinks further. Note: It is perhaps better to consider these questions in terms of the aircraft's energy: Headwind increasing / tailwind decreasing = gain of energy Tailwind increasing / headwind decreasing = loss of energy",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

This is one of the rules that pilots should live by! This is a common approach to all flying situations, especially emergency conditions. Before anything else, remember to fly the aircraft and maintain it under control. Only when time permits, communicate with ATC. Then the appropriate drill for the aircraft type must be carried out, which normally would include a shutdown checklist. When the fire has stopped, the engine should never be restarted, and an emergency landing follows in case of single-engine aircraft or loss of all engines. With regards to the landing itself, remember that flaps steepen the descent angle - in other words, you run the risk of falling short of the runway. So in a glide you keep the flaps up until you can be certain of making the landing point. Once the landing is guaranteed, you can then deploy gear as well as flap to slow down as much as possible - being aware that these actions will further reduce the gliding range, so constant reevaluation is required. Note: A precautionary landing is an expedited landing to a nearby airport when an immediate assistance and landing is not required, yest to continue the flight to its destination is considered unsafe. => This not the case. An emergency landing is required.",

                "Upwind - the wind is “hitting” your airplane first and then the other"
            ],
            "explanation": "Wing tip vortices tend to sink below the flight path of the aircraft that generated them and flow outwards. Therefore, the succeding aircraft should stay above and upwind from the other aircraft's flight path. Upwind - the wind is “hitting” your airplane first and then the other. Downwind - wind is hitting the large plane first and, therefore, will move the vortices in the direction of your airplane (which is undesirable). If the wind is coming from the left, you should fly on the left side (and above) of the track of the preceding aircraft. Further info on WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

A cold weather start is a perfect scenario for an engine fire, particularly if we get carried away with the primer. Excess fuel makes its way into the carburetor intake, then the engine backfires through the carburetor, igniting the fuel along with the dirty air filter. The normal procedure is to keep cranking the engine if this happens. This should suck the flames back through the carburetor and extinguish the blaze, and if the engine starts, let it run for a minute or so, then shut it down and inspect the damage. If the engine doesn't start after cranking it for the time recommended by the checklist, shut down, evacuate the aircraft, and, if it's not already extinguished, use the extinguisher to put out the fire.",

By keeping the nose high, the entire bottom of the plane can cushion your initial impact, as well as keeping branches from breaking through the windshield. When it comes to choosing the right trees to land on, you want to try to pick trees that are low and closely spaced, as opposed to tall trees with thin tops.

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

The expected attitude of the aircraft in the water is almost always “nose up”, so that the rear doors will not be usable for evacuation. After the cabin crew identify all the usable exits and check that the slides/life rafts are deployed and inflated, the objective for them is to maintain an evenly distributed flow of passengers towards all available exits. Life jackets should be donned by all, but not inflated until outside the aircraft. If life rafts are carried, passengers should be briefed on the procedures for detachable escape slides at exits. Passengers should directly embark in the life rafts and not first in the water. When a person suddenly comes into contact with extremely cold water, they experience a cold shock response. The person will hyperventilate and take uncontrollable, deep and fast breaths for the next one or three minutes. If one goes underwater in this state, he/she could swallow water and drown. Whenever possible, after evacuation, link all the rafts together to maximize the visual target for the search parties. Cabin crew should ensure that passenger raft count does not exceed recommended raft capacity and attempt to assign crewmember(s) to each raft to establish command. Groups should be kept together and away from the aircraft, spilt fuel and debris. Split fuel could possibly be ignited, leading to a post-impact fire. Even if ignition sources were suppressed by the water, the inhalation and ingestion of fuel vapours can pose severe health risks to survivors. Each cabin crew member should check for any remaining passengers, and as soon as their assigned area is empty, evacuate the aircraft with survival kits.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

            "explanation": "Ground de-icing / anti-icing can be carried out either in one stage or two stages. One stage de-icing / anti-icing is where heated anti-icing fluid is applied to the aircraft surfaces; the heat de-ices the aircraft, and the fluid remains on the aircraft to provide sufficient anti-icing capability. The holdover time begins at the start of the single stage. Two stage de-icing / anti-icing means that the first stage applies a dedicated de-icing fluid, and then the second stage applies a dedicated anti-icing fluid. The holdover time begins at the start of the second (anti-icing) stage. The holdover time (HOT) is the estimated duration during which de-icing/anti-icing fluid remains effective. The aircraft must begin its takeoff roll within this time frame; otherwise, the entire process of de-icing followed by anti-icing must be repeated. Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. Note: High humidity often correlates with increased precipitation rates (e.g., rain, snow, sleet). Higher precipitation rates can overwhelm the fluid's ability to keep ice from forming, thus reducing its effective duration.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 9817 Manual on Low-level Wind Shear Take-off precautions Thrust setting 4.3.13 Maximum rated take-off thrust should be used for take-off. This shortens the take-off roll and reduces overrun exposure. Full thrust also provides the best rate of climb, thus increasing altitude available for recovery if required. Lastly, full thrust take-offs may eliminate resetting thrust in a recovery, thereby maximizing acceleration capability and reducing crew workload. Runway selection 4.3.14 Use the longest suitable runway that avoids suspected areas of wind shear. The choice of a suitable runway involves consideration of exposure to obstacles after lift-off and crosswind and tailwind Chapter 4. Effect of Low-level Wind Shear on Aircraft Performance 4-25 limitations. This assures maximum runway available to accelerate to rotation speed and may result in more ground clearance at the end of the runway and during the climb profile. Should the decision be made to reject the take-off, more runway is available on which to stop the aircraft. Take-off flap selection Take-off flap selection 4.3.15 The choice of take-off flap setting is dependent on the aircraft type. The flap settings in Table 4-2 should be considered unless limited by obstacle clearance and/or climb gradient. Studies of available take-off flap settings showed that the greater flap setting provided best performance for wind shear encounters on the runway. However, lesser flap settings showed the best performance for in-air wind shear encounters. The take-off flap settings given in Table 4-2 offered somewhat better performance over a wide range of conditions; however, it must be pointed out that the performance difference between flap settings is small. Increased airspeed 4.3.16 Increased airspeed at rotation improves the ability of the aircraft to negotiate a wind shear encountered after lift-off. Increased airspeed improves the flight path, reduces potential exposure to flight near stick-shaker speeds, and reduces pilot workload. 4.3.17 Delaying rotation to a higher airspeed may appear to increase the risk of overrunning available runway. However, because of the manner in which increased rotation speed is calculated, it is simply using the runway as if the aircraft was loaded to the field length limit mass for that runway. If the take-off is at field length limit conditions, the risk of overrunning the available runway is increased because there is no extra runway available. The overrun exposure is also increased if the wind shear reduces the airspeed below the minimum airspeed required for lift-off at the maximum available (body contact) attitude. However, initiating rotation no later than 600 m (2 000 ft) from the end of the usable runway surface reduces the probability of overrun and maximizes the available energy after lift-off Note: Table 4-2 suggest flap settings for different aircrafts.",

A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, gradually developing engine trouble, darkness approaching faster than anticipated (when the pilot does not have night flying experience).

'Have the aircraft inspected as the flight control surfaces might be jammed by frozen water residues in the tracks.' --> CORRECT. Not the greatest answer but the only possible correct one here. A pre de-icing check is valuable to confirm the amount and type of contamination and to determine what type and concentration of fluid etc to use.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. The wear of carbon brakes is primarily determined by the total number of brake applications. A single firm brake application causes less wear compared to multiple light applications. To minimize wear and maximize the lifespan of carbon brakes during taxi, it is recommended to employ a strategy of using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications rather than frequent, light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing the taxi speed to increase and then utilizing a single firm brake application to reduce the speed. If necessary, this process can be repeated as needed, instead of maintaining a constant taxi speed through numerous brake applications. By following this approach, the minimum wear and maximum longevity of carbon brakes can be achieved during taxi operations. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

Looking at the answers: 'Accelerate to move through the layer in the least possible time' --> INCORRECT. The safest way to avoid CB's is to avoid them laterally. Flying faster does not necessarily help, it would enhance any turbulence. 'Try to climb above the clouds' and 'Climb to a optimum FL and increase your pitch' --> INCORRECT. Climbing is not really an option as being able to out climb such weather is very unlikely. Furthermore, increasing the pitch, only puts the aircraft closer to the critical angle of attack. 'Maintain present FL, knowing also that ice may form and give you unreliable altitude and airspeed readout' --> CORRECT. Of course flying through at the current level is uncertain, but it is the best option available if unable to circumnavigate around CB's.",
