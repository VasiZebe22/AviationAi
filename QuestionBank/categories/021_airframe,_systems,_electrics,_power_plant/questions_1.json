The performance of atmospherically exposed metals depends on five main factors: temperature, humidity, rainfall, sulfur dioxide (pollution) concentration in the air, and air salinity. Temperature - an increase in temperature will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. A rule of thumb is that temperature increases of 10°C will double the corrosion rate. Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap. It is incorrect because flaps can be made as strong as you like. They could manage up to +15G if the manufacturer wants to. There are minimum values to their strength though, defined in the certification specifications.",

They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component.

Safe-Life: This is de minimum life during which it is known that no catastrophic damage should occur. The life of such a structure can be defined in different ways, cycles, flight hours, pressurization events or calendar time. After this interval has been reached the structure should be replaced, inspected or overhauled per manufacturers recommendations. Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan.

Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",

Redundancy is another word for additional, or duplicate, and means that there is not just one load path or one source for any system. Essentially, to provide the correct amount of safety in the case of a failure under the \"fail-safe\" design concept, there needs to be another option to stop a catastrophic event occurring. For structural items, this is usually multiple load paths, so that if one breaks, the other can take the required forces without fully breaking. For systems, there are usually extra sources (electrical power, hydraulic pressure, etc.) to stop a complete failure of the more essential systems, such as flight controls or landing gear extension.",

Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment.",

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. \"Pilots need to log every landing in order to know when cyclic load limitations may be exceeded.\" Correct. By keeping a record of landings, pilots and maintenance personnel can ensure that the aircraft remains within safe operating limits. Exceeding cyclic load limitations can lead to structural fatigue or damage, compromising the safety and airworthiness of the aircraft.",

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer. The other options are both substances that are contained by metal, so are certainly not corrosive to it.",

            "explanation": "Operators must follow a constant cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation, and lubrication to prevent corrosion. Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

Buckling is similar, but that indicates that significant compression has occurred, also a form of stress. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as turbulence, excessive vibration, or high loads during takeoff or landing. Over time, the stress can cause the material to weaken, which can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed. The above image was apparently the result of a hard landing, which makes sense as it is around the main gear. Paint wear and bulges, impact dents and scratches, and faded paintwork may all be cosmetic issues that do not necessarily indicate stress on the airframe. While impact dents may cause localized stress, they do not necessarily indicate continuous stress on the entire airframe. It is important to regularly inspect the aircraft for signs of stress and take appropriate maintenance and repair actions to ensure safe and reliable operation.",

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you!

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

            "explanation": "Since pressurisation forces are to be resisted by flight deck windows as well as the cabin structure, the windows need to be strong. To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

Flutter is caused by the interaction of aerodynamic forces, inertia forces and the elastic properties of the surface or structure and can lead to the catastrophic failure of the structure. An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards. If the aircraft is subjected to a gust it will shake up and down with the wings flapping at a certain frequency. If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge). Poorly maintained aircraft, particularly those with excessive control surface backlash (play) or flexibility may mean that flutter could occur at speeds below the limit airspeed.",

When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

            "explanation": "An airframe is the combination of the whole structure of an aircraft. It undergoes many forces during flight, the largest being the lifting force from the wings. Whatever the weight of the aircraft, the wings have to be able to suspend that amount of force with lift, and the vast majority of that force goes through the two wing roots. Hence, they are usually the strongest place on the entire aircraft. A very high stress scenario for the aircraft is pulling any sort of G-force, which requires increasing the load factor of the wings, and that means the lift of the wing has to increase. Large transport aircraft (CS-25) have a \"limit load factor\" of 2.5 G, and must be able to pull 150% of this (3.75 G) before complete structural failure occurs. This means that an aircraft will have to show during testing that the structure (mostly the wing spar and wing root) can withstand a lifting force of 3.75 times its own maximum take-off weight, which can be an incredible amount of force, before failing. Any G-force over the limit load factor is an \"overload\". An aircraft increases its loading during manoeuvres, so in banked turns (the greater the bank, the higher the wing loading), and any abrupt changes in direction, pitch, etc. Also, the loading increases in turbulence and any windshear. Aircraft stress obviously increases with weight, but the limiting load factor is set for the MTOW, so it can only get better as the aircraft gets lighter. VA is the manoeuvring speed, and if flying below VA, the aircraft will be unable to pull its limit load factor during a manoeuvre, as it will stall first, and therefore will not overload the airframe. Headwinds and tailwinds do not affect loading, as the aircraft just flies through the air mass it is in, and the head/tailwinds simply move the air mass forwards or backwards, increasing or decreasing groundspeed. As long as the winds do not change rapidly (windshear), this should not affect aircraft loading.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

If the hole was in the passenger cabin, then the cargo hold high pressure would push up on the floor, again causing it to buckle.

            "explanation": "Ensuring accurate calculation of take-off performance data is crucial for reducing the chance of a tail strike during take-off. Knowing the correct rotation speed allows pilots to smoothly lift the aircraft's nose at the right moment. If the rotation speed is too high, it can lead to an excessively steep climb angle, increasing the likelihood of a tail strike as the aircraft leaves the ground. Conversely, if the rotation speed is too low, the aircraft may not achieve the desired pitch attitude for liftoff, potentially causing a tail strike as well. The two major threats for tail strikes to occur are during the landing flare/touchdown and during rotation on take-off. As many large jet transport aircraft are extended in length for larger passenger numbers, the long tail leaves very little tail margin during rotation, and factors such as crosswinds, gusty head/tailwinds and different weight and CG locations can lead to the potential for reduced tail clearance or tail strike. To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

Materials all have different properties, such as their strength, elasticity, resistance to corrosion, weight, cost, heat resistance, etc. The material that is chosen for the vast majority of aircraft construction is usually metal (composites are becoming more widely used in the sector, but metal is still the bulk of the industry). Different metals have different levels of strength, they are different to work with, and are used in different sections of the aircraft. For instance, the fuselage is usually made from an easily manufactured aluminium alloy, but sections of the hot engine are made from the very expensive, but incredibly heat resistant titanium. Alloys are a clever way of combining the different properties of two or more metals to make them better for the required usage. Now to answer this question. In general, metal has a high strength to weight ratio (in that it is strong but also light). The only better type of material for strength to weight ratio is composites. Composites such as carbon fibre, aramid (Kevlar), fibreglass, and plastic composites can be made incredibly strong, but far lighter than metals. Their fibres can also be aligned to create strength in particular directions, which is much harder to do in metal. The answer is not composites though, because they are very resistant to corrosion. Metal, however, is highly susceptible to corrosion, and it is a large part of what engineers check for and treat when they maintain an aircraft.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. Heating elements are added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. The heating elements usually heat the windows into this temperature range, switch off so they do not overheat, then switch back on again if the window is going to cool down too much, cycling like this throughout every flight. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly that restriction is to be not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

Strength-to-weight ratio is an important factor, as materials with a high strength-to-weight ratio are either stronger or lighter than other materials, both of which are useful for aviation. This is why metal and composites are so commonly used for aircraft construction, due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. As for the other options, susceptibility to corrosion is bad as it will weaken the airframe and potentially lead to failure. We want the material to be strong, but being brittle is not good, as it will be likely to snap or shatter instead of bending.",

Corrosion is unlikely to remove rivets on its own, as they are fused to the skin, and corrosion would have to be incredibly severe (and therefore noticeable) to start removing them completely. Hard landings and high manoeuvring loads can remove rivets, screws, and other fasteners through shearing forces, for example, if the \"improper maintenance or installation\" option is not present in the exam, this option should be chosen. With the options as they are, hard landing and manoeuvring loads are less likely to cause the complete loss of rivets than improper maintenance or installation. Engine failure or malfunction has nothing to do with the rivets really, and they should easily be able to deal with the forces involved.",

They also sometimes contain layers of toughened (tempered) glass, as it is incredibly strong, and protects well against small impacts at high speed. The layering of different materials help to provide better impact resistance than one type of material only, combining the best features of all the materials. Aircraft windshields also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds.

The appropriate action to take if an operator notices corrosion on metal parts of their aircraft fleet is to repair, prime, and paint the damaged parts. This is important because corrosion can weaken the metal and compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft, which can be a safety hazard. Replacing the metal parts with plastic or composite materials may be an option, but it can be expensive and may not always be feasible. It is also important to note that different materials have different properties, and they may not be suitable for all applications. Washing the aircraft thoroughly after each flight may be important for general maintenance but may not prevent corrosion. A notable point is that washing the aircraft after every flight could cause some water based corrosion or rusting over time, so is not a good idea to fight corrosion. Painting over the corrosion to protect the area and add strength is not a recommended practice as it does not address the underlying corrosion issue and can lead to further damage. Therefore, the best course of action is to have the affected parts assessed by a qualified technician and have the corrosion removed and repaired, and then properly primed and painted to protect against further corrosion.",

There are many potential weak points in this, including windows, hatches, and doors. Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage. They can be manually operated, and often are.",

The performance of atmospherically exposed metals depends on five main factors: temperature, humidity, rainfall, sulfur dioxide (pollution) concentration in the air, and air salinity. Temperature - an increase in temperature will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. A rule of thumb is that temperature increases of 10°C will double the corrosion rate. Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap. It is incorrect because flaps can be made as strong as you like. They could manage up to +15G if the manufacturer wants to. There are minimum values to their strength though, defined in the certification specifications.",

Aircraft landing gear is designed to withstand landing at a particular aircraft weight and vertical descent velocity. If either of these parameters are exceeded during a landing then damage may have been caused to the landing gear or supporting structure and these loads can be transmitted to the fuselage and mainplanes - Overstressing the structures.",

They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.01.02.01.01: Explain how stress and strain are always present in an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component.

After this interval has been reached the structure should be replaced, inspected or overhauled per manufacturers recommendations. Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan. This question simply wants you to know that there are constantly loads of all types occuring on an aircraft at all times. static loads also occur whilst in flight, and dynamic loads occur on the ground, even when parked (wind, boarding, etc.), so the two statements are both incorrect.",

We have received some feedback that this is one of the options, but do not know which the examiner is choosing as correct with this new option present. We are keeping the original answer to this for now (\"white spots.\"), but require any further feedback that anyone can remember from their exam, thank you!",

Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",

The aircraft must be capable of withstanding 150% of this \"limit load\" before failure occurs (which is the \"ultimate load\"). CS-25 aircraft, for instance, have a limit load factor of 2.5G at the minimum, meaning that they must be tested to 3.75G (150% of 2.5) without failure. Any forces higher than 2.5G can begin to cause irreversible bending of the airframe and are not assured to be withstood by every airframe in a fleet, so it is never recommended to exceed this limit load factor unless extreme circumstances make it necessary for safety.",

Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment.",

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

The Safe-life philosophy indicates that a component in the aircraft has a given time period or life cycle that it should withstand without any failure. The life of such a structure can be defined in different ways, cycles, flight hours, pressurization events or calendar time. The Safe-life philosophy requires parts to be replaced at the end of their specified life, regardless of their condition. A Fail-safe structural element is designed so that the part distributes the load in a way that it goes through multiple load paths. This means that in the case of a crack in the structural element appearing, the rest of the structure is still able to withstand the prescribed loads for a limited amount of time until the crack is detected by maintenance and the element replaced. This principle is called redundancy.",

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer. The other options are both substances that are contained by metal, so are certainly not corrosive to it.",

            "explanation": "Operators must follow a constant cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation, and lubrication to prevent corrosion. Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

It is strictly forbidden to allow components to remain in service after the conclusion of their hard-time period. On-condition maintenance: refers to predictive maintenance that involves replacement or overhaul of components before a failure happens. Regular inspection of components gives maintenance teams records about the condition of each monitored part on an aircraft. This type of maintenance is based on monitoring of critical parameters of a component or piece of equipment and its replacement if a limit value is exceeded. The inspections are often done without completely tearing down each component, as indicators of wear or damage can be seen quickly, without excess work or aircraft down-time. The two maintenance processes are more or less useful for different components of an aircraft, dependent on their wear, risk of failure, etc. This means that an aircraft will often have hard-time maintenance tasks on some components, and on-condition maintenance tasks on other components. If the aircraft has a CRS (Certificate of Release to Service), it has been checked and is considered airworthy until a defect is found or the time/cycle limits given are reached.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials.

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you! NOTE: The answer with the UK CAA is not yet confirmed.",

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

Due to the pressure from inside, the skin stretches (tension) and the circumference increases (obviously the circumference of the fuselage only increases fractional – compared to the balloon)",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

Flutter is caused by the interaction of aerodynamic forces, inertia forces and the elastic properties of the surface or structure and can lead to the catastrophic failure of the structure. An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards. If the aircraft is subjected to a gust it will shake up and down with the wings flapping at a certain frequency. If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge). Poorly maintained aircraft, particularly those with excessive control surface backlash (play) or flexibility may mean that flutter could occur at speeds below the limit airspeed.",

Cross section 2 => shows a circular fuselage which is the most suitable for a pressurised cabin as forces/pressure are distributed in the most even manner over the fuselage. Cross section 3 => depicts a double bubble sort of fuselage which is second most suitable because forces are almost distributed equally over the fuselage. These kinds are often used because of the space it can provide for passengers or cargo. Cross section 4 => represents largely one circle which is inturrupted by another shape.

When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

            "explanation": "An airframe is the combination of the whole structure of an aircraft. It undergoes many forces during flight, the largest being the lifting force from the wings. Whatever the weight of the aircraft, the wings have to be able to suspend that amount of force with lift, and the vast majority of that force goes through the two wing roots. Hence, they are usually the strongest place on the entire aircraft. A very high stress scenario for the aircraft is pulling any sort of G-force, which requires increasing the load factor of the wings, and that means the lift of the wing has to increase. Large transport aircraft (CS-25) have a \"limit load factor\" of 2.5 G, and must be able to pull 150% of this (3.75 G) before complete structural failure occurs. This means that an aircraft will have to show during testing that the structure (mostly the wing spar and wing root) can withstand a lifting force of 3.75 times its own maximum take-off weight, which can be an incredible amount of force, before failing. Any G-force over the limit load factor is an \"overload\". An aircraft increases its loading during manoeuvres, so in banked turns (the greater the bank, the higher the wing loading), and any abrupt changes in direction, pitch, etc. Also, the loading increases in turbulence and any windshear. Aircraft stress obviously increases with weight, but the limiting load factor is set for the MTOW, so it can only get better as the aircraft gets lighter. VA is the manoeuvring speed, and if flying below VA, the aircraft will be unable to pull its limit load factor during a manoeuvre, as it will stall first, and therefore will not overload the airframe. Headwinds and tailwinds do not affect loading, as the aircraft just flies through the air mass it is in, and the head/tailwinds simply move the air mass forwards or backwards, increasing or decreasing groundspeed. As long as the winds do not change rapidly (windshear), this should not affect aircraft loading.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

Floor vents (blow-out panels) exist in an aircraft to provide a location for easy flow of air in the event of a depressurisation between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. If a rapid depressurisation event occurred from a hole in the cargo hold, then the high pressure in the passenger cabin would push down very strongly on the floor, causing it to buckle. If the hole was in the passenger cabin, then the cargo hold high pressure would push up on the floor, again causing it to buckle. The floor vents are panels in and around the floor that easily break/open, leaving a gap where the air can equalise pressure without further damage.",

            "explanation": "Ensuring accurate calculation of take-off performance data is crucial for reducing the chance of a tail strike during take-off. Knowing the correct rotation speed allows pilots to smoothly lift the aircraft's nose at the right moment. If the rotation speed is too high, it can lead to an excessively steep climb angle, increasing the likelihood of a tail strike as the aircraft leaves the ground. Conversely, if the rotation speed is too low, the aircraft may not achieve the desired pitch attitude for liftoff, potentially causing a tail strike as well. The two major threats for tail strikes to occur are during the landing flare/touchdown and during rotation on take-off. As many large jet transport aircraft are extended in length for larger passenger numbers, the long tail leaves very little tail margin during rotation, and factors such as crosswinds, gusty head/tailwinds and different weight and CG locations can lead to the potential for reduced tail clearance or tail strike. To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

Materials all have different properties, such as their strength, elasticity, resistance to corrosion, weight, cost, heat resistance, etc. The material that is chosen for the vast majority of aircraft construction is usually metal (composites are becoming more widely used in the sector, but metal is still the bulk of the industry). Different metals have different levels of strength, they are different to work with, and are used in different sections of the aircraft. For instance, the fuselage is usually made from an easily manufactured aluminium alloy, but sections of the hot engine are made from the very expensive, but incredibly heat resistant titanium. Alloys are a clever way of combining the different properties of two or more metals to make them better for the required usage. Now to answer this question. In general, metal has a high strength to weight ratio (in that it is strong but also light). The only better type of material for strength to weight ratio is composites. Composites such as carbon fibre, aramid (Kevlar), fibreglass, and plastic composites can be made incredibly strong, but far lighter than metals. Their fibres can also be aligned to create strength in particular directions, which is much harder to do in metal. The answer is not composites though, because they are very resistant to corrosion. Metal, however, is highly susceptible to corrosion, and it is a large part of what engineers check for and treat when they maintain an aircraft.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. Heating elements are added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. The heating elements usually heat the windows into this temperature range, switch off so they do not overheat, then switch back on again if the window is going to cool down too much, cycling like this throughout every flight. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly that restriction is to be not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

Corrosion is unlikely to remove rivets on its own, as they are fused to the skin, and corrosion would have to be incredibly severe (and therefore noticeable) to start removing them completely.

They also sometimes contain layers of toughened (tempered) glass, as it is incredibly strong, and protects well against small impacts at high speed. The layering of different materials help to provide better impact resistance than one type of material only, combining the best features of all the materials. Aircraft windshields also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds.

The appropriate action to take if an operator notices corrosion on metal parts of their aircraft fleet is to repair, prime, and paint the damaged parts. This is important because corrosion can weaken the metal and compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft, which can be a safety hazard. Replacing the metal parts with plastic or composite materials may be an option, but it can be expensive and may not always be feasible. It is also important to note that different materials have different properties, and they may not be suitable for all applications. Washing the aircraft thoroughly after each flight may be important for general maintenance but may not prevent corrosion. A notable point is that washing the aircraft after every flight could cause some water based corrosion or rusting over time, so is not a good idea to fight corrosion. Painting over the corrosion to protect the area and add strength is not a recommended practice as it does not address the underlying corrosion issue and can lead to further damage. Therefore, the best course of action is to have the affected parts assessed by a qualified technician and have the corrosion removed and repaired, and then properly primed and painted to protect against further corrosion.",

There are many potential weak points in this, including windows, hatches, and doors. Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage. They can be manually operated, and often are.",

It is not used on the ground, nor would it be useful without any airflow through it.

Whilst this is an awful question, which pilots would usually have no business dealing with, it can still be worked out with the normal knowledge from the syllabus. A hydraulic accumulator is a device used to store hydraulic pressure, for the purposes of smoothing out hydraulic pressure changes, and storing the pressure in case there is a loss of hydraulic pump, so a finite amount of pressure remains for further uses. It works by compressing nitrogen inside the accumulator with the force of the hydraulic fluid, and then the high pressure nitrogen is where the energy is stored. There are a few different ways to do this, via diaphragm, with a moving piston between the fluid and the nitrogen, and with no separation at all, just gravity. These are the types of gas charged accumulators, but there are also spring accumulators and even weighted accumulators that can be used. We do not normally look into these though. If an accumulator was mounted horizontally, the gravity option would not keep the fluid in the lines, so would not work. Therefore only a diaphragm or (more likely) a moving piston would be used in this orientation. This should mean that there is no cross-contamination of nitrogen and hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid stays on one side of the piston/diaphragm, the nitrogen stays on the other side. If, as in this scenario, there is an amount of hydraulic fluid leaving the nitrogen release valve, then there must have been some sort of leak between the two, for hydraulic fluid to enter the nitrogen section.",

In this case, hydraulic pressure is a gauge pressure, and is therefore measured against atmospheric pressure. We can also work this out by thinking about what happens when you de-pressurise a hydraulic system completely. The hydraulic pressure will read 0 PSI, as the fluid is exerting the same amount of pressure on its surroundings as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 PSI greater than a vacuum (i.e. its absolute pressure is 14.7 PSI, or 1013 hPa). For instance, manifold pressure gauges read out MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure), so show the absolute ambient pressure when the engine is off. Other systems rarely read out absolute pressure.",

Nitrogen gas is widely prevalent in hydraulic systems for various reasons.

This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. Note: The wording is unconfirmed on this question as it came from limited feedback, but we don't expect any significant differences to the real exam, certainly nothing that will change the answer.",

An active hydraulic system is used for braking (and many other things) on large aircraft, where a system is constantly pressurised and the brakes are operated by action on the brake pedals effectively turning a valve to allow more or less of that pressure to work on the brakes.

Hydraulic Accumulators are usually installed in hydraulic systems to store energy, in the form of hydraulic fluid under pressure (which will allow limited operation of hydraulic services when the pump is not operating or in case of an emergency) and to dampen out pressure fluctuations within the system. They are often used after a pump in a hydraulic system to do both these jobs, and by doing so increase efficiency and reduce the stresses on the hydraulic system. They can use a diaphragm or a movable piston, with one side connected to the hydraulic lines and containing hydraulic fluid, but with the other side filled with gas (usually nitrogen), which can compress to the same pressure as the system.

On some large aircraft (such as the Airbus A320 family), the cargo doors are very heavy and are therefore lifted by hydraulics. They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc. Power transfer units are used to transfer hydraulic pressure (not fluid) from one system to another, but one system has to be pressurised for this to work, and that is not the case in this scenario. External hydraulic power units do not exist for this kind of scenario. That is a fake option, playing on the fact that external air carts and external ground power units can feed the aircraft pneumatic systems and electrical systems, but not hydraulics.",

A single acting cylinder produces linear motion in one direction. Operation described in the attached figure. A Double Acting Actuator is an actuator in which fluid acts on both sides of the piston.

Early aircraft had a single braking system with no backup or redundancy, meaning that any failure could result in total loss of braking capability. Nowadays, most large passenger aircraft have braking redundancy which is achieved by multiple, independent hydraulic systems backed up by accumulators. These systems allow for several layers of failure without resulting in total loss of braking capability. In most cases, the right hydraulic system supplies the normal brakes. If this is lost, there is an automatic switchover to Alternate Brakes powered by the center system. In addition to supply system redundancy, the brake accumulator is also an emergency source of power for the brakes in many power brake systems. The accumulator is pre-charged with air or nitrogen on one side of its internal diaphragm. Enough hydraulic fluid is contained on the other side of the diaphragm to operate the brakes in case of an emergency.",

Only the simplest hydraulic systems, such as the brake circuit on a light aircraft, are powered by human effort. All advanced hydraulic systems use some form of pump to increase hydraulic pressure and facilitate fluid flow under pressure. Hydraulic systems can be classified as either: Low-pressure systems: Typically operating up to 2000 PSI. High-pressure systems: Typically operating at 3000 PSI, though some aircraft may use hydraulic pressures of 4000 to 5000 PSI. High pressure reduces fluid volume and component mass. However, even at higher pressures, hydraulic fluid is considered incompressible. Very high pressures can induce shear stresses in the fluid, leading to adverse hydraulic effects. Additionally, there is a slightly increased risk of fluid leaks at joints in the lines. Properties High Pressure Low Pressure Weight (similar size aircraft) Lighter due to smaller actuators Higher Force Able to apply extremely large forces Unable to apply larger forces Construction Complex Simple Pressure Yes No",

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It runs at a constant RPM and modulates its volumetric flow output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. In terms of hydraulic pressures, most large transport aircraft have hydraulic pressures in the range of 3000 - 5000 psi as this is a good amount to power heavy control surfaces and landing gear systems, etc. Larger aircraft tend to have higher pressures in general, and the Airbus A380 runs hydraulic pressures of 5000 psi, whereas Boeing 737s run at 3000 psi.",

The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability. Hydraulic fluids are also \"irritating to skin and eyes\" according to the Learning Objectives. This is another reason that we believe that the corrosion answer is most correct. The internal workings of the hydraulic system will be metal, perhaps with special coatings, but certainly not paint. The aircraft is covered with paint though, and anyone who has carelessly bled brakes before will know that brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) is corrosive to paintwork. Whether it will harm the bodywork underneath would depend on the material and the individual fluid. Whilst it should have good anti-corrosion properties, who knows how good those are, especially against different materials. Important Note: We have received conflicting feedback about this question. Any further exam feedback would therefore be very useful to help us verify this question, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments.

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure.",

An accumulator is fitted to store hydraulic fluid under pressure, dampen hydraulic pressure fluctuations, allow for thermal expansion and provide an emergency supply of hydraulic fluid under pressure to the system in the event of a pump failure. The gas side of the accumulator is charged to a predetermined pressure with air or nitrogen. As the accumulator is fitted and the hydraulic pressure in the system builds up, the gas in the accumulator will be compressed until fluid and gas pressures equalise at normal system pressure. That is why the accumulator gauge will read the same as the hydraulic system is pressurised to. The correct answer mentions that it provides \"hydraulic power\" in the event of a system failure or emergency, which is correct, as the gas is compressed to store energy which keeps the fluid pressurised in order to provide power onto hydraulic actuators if the pumps fail. This is often used for things such as brake applications in the event of a complete hydraulic failure.",

            "explanation": "Axial piston pumps are constant pressure pump (variable volume). This pump supplies fluid at a variable volume and can control the pressure. The cylinder and the drive-shaft are coaxial and rotate taking the pistons which can move up and down in the cylinder. The pistons are a connected to shoes to the non-rotating yoke or swash plate. The angle of the swash-plate and thus the piston stroke is varied by the position of the control piston. This piston is controlled by the outlet pressure on one side of it and a spring on the other. If the pump is stationary there will be no hydraulic pressure and so the spring will push the control piston to the right and the swash-plate angle will be maximum. As the pump begins to rotate the pistons will start moving up and down because of the angle of the swash-plate. If the required operating pressure is reached, the control piston will be pushed back to the left causing the swash-plate to be almost vertical and therefore the pistons’ stroke will be minimal. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 2 shows the pump at maximum stroke and picture 3 shows the pump at minimum stroke.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap. It is incorrect because flaps can be made as strong as you like. They could manage up to +15G if the manufacturer wants to. There are minimum values to their strength though, defined in the certification specifications.",

Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.01.02.01.01: Explain how stress and strain are always present in an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times.",

The life of such a structure can be defined in different ways, cycles, flight hours, pressurization events or calendar time. After this interval has been reached the structure should be replaced, inspected or overhauled per manufacturers recommendations. Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan. This question simply wants you to know that there are constantly loads of all types occuring on an aircraft at all times. static loads also occur whilst in flight, and dynamic loads occur on the ground, even when parked (wind, boarding, etc.), so the two statements are both incorrect.",

Unfortunately, the wording makes this question rather difficult to answer at all, and the answer we evaluated as \"most correct\" is not correct in the exams. Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",

Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment.",

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer.

            "explanation": "Operators must follow a constant cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation, and lubrication to prevent corrosion. Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

The above image was apparently the result of a hard landing, which makes sense as it is around the main gear. Paint wear and bulges, impact dents and scratches, and faded paintwork may all be cosmetic issues that do not necessarily indicate stress on the airframe.

It is strictly forbidden to allow components to remain in service after the conclusion of their hard-time period. On-condition maintenance: refers to predictive maintenance that involves replacement or overhaul of components before a failure happens. Regular inspection of components gives maintenance teams records about the condition of each monitored part on an aircraft. This type of maintenance is based on monitoring of critical parameters of a component or piece of equipment and its replacement if a limit value is exceeded. The inspections are often done without completely tearing down each component, as indicators of wear or damage can be seen quickly, without excess work or aircraft down-time. The two maintenance processes are more or less useful for different components of an aircraft, dependent on their wear, risk of failure, etc. This means that an aircraft will often have hard-time maintenance tasks on some components, and on-condition maintenance tasks on other components. If the aircraft has a CRS (Certificate of Release to Service), it has been checked and is considered airworthy until a defect is found or the time/cycle limits given are reached.",

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you!

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

To secure the windows, they are fastened to the frame using bolts that pass through the edges of the windscreen. To counter ice formation and enhance bird strike resistance, an electrically conducting coating is applied to the inner surface of the outer glass panel, providing the window with heating capabilities.

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards.

If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge).

The fuselage is most susceptible to fatigue, but the wings are too, especially on short hauls where an aircraft goes through pressurization cycles every day.

Aircrafts designed for long-haul flights typically are designed for flight cycles involving long cruises, between take-off/landing.

This kind of fuselage would only be used on a light unpressurised aircraft suitable because of the easy construction. Cross section 2 => shows a circular fuselage which is the most suitable for a pressurised cabin as forces/pressure are distributed in the most even manner over the fuselage. Cross section 3 => depicts a double bubble sort of fuselage which is second most suitable because forces are almost distributed equally over the fuselage. These kinds are often used because of the space it can provide for passengers or cargo. Cross section 4 => represents largely one circle which is inturrupted by another shape. In this case, forces are distributed better than in a squared fuselage, however, it is not as strong as a double bubble construction. Correct sequence: 2, 3, 4, 1 (decreasing stability)",

When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

Cantilever wings are built so that no external bracing is needed. They are supported internally by structural members assisted by the skin of the aircraft. Stationary on the ground the wings are drooping under gravity, streching the top skin (tension) and compressing the bottom skin. In flight lift, lift is pulling the wings up (bent upwards), stretching the bottom (tension) and compressing the top.",

The outside skin gives the fuselage its aerodynamic shape and can support a major portion of the flight loads. Longerons hold the bulkheads and formers. The longerons are supplemented by other longitudinal members known as stringers. Stringers stiffen the skin and assist the sheet materials to carry loads along their length. Stringers and longerons prevent tension and compression stresses from bending the fuselage. The vertical structural members are referred to as bulkheads, rings and formers (frames). The bulkheads, rings and formers hold the stringers. All of these join together to form a rigid fuselage framework.",
