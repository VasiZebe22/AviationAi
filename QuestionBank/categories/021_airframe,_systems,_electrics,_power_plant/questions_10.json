Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance. In addition to the main optimised braking function, anti-skid systems offer other functions including: The ASU prevents brake application before touchdown on landing. It will prevent any brake pressure even if brake pedals are pressed before touchdown to allow the stationary wheels to spin-up to speed on contact. Only after spin-up does the ASU allow brake preassure application. The ASU protects against the locking of any wheel during the braking process by avoiding excessive wheel-slip values. The ASU protects against the effects of hydroplanning.",

            "explanation": "Brakes on a car are operated by the driver pushing on the brake pedal, which uses a piston to squeeze hydraulic fluid into the brake lines, which then applies a force on the brake pads, pressing the pads onto the spinning disks to create friction, which gives braking action. This is, of course, a hydraulic system. Hydraulic systems are an excellent way to transfer forces around a vehicle like a car or an aircraft. The main benefit of hydraulics is that the fluid is not compressible, so the force from the brake pedal piston is immediately (and completely) transferred onto the brake pads. This applies to an aircraft as well, as the only difference is that large aircraft brakes use multiple brake pads (stators) and brake disks (rotors), and the braking systems are usually supplemented by the high pressure hydraulic systems that run the rest of the aircraft's systems to gain higher forces than just the pilot's feet can produce. The emergency braking system that is mentioned in this question is to be used in the case of a loss of hydraulic pressure, and extra pressure can be gained by firing a single burst of high pressure gas into the brake lines, which then allow the brakes to be used (not nicely, but better than nothing). Because of the gas (most likely Nitrogen to reduce fire risk) now inside the hydraulic brake lines, the force applied to the pedals is not going to be completely applied to the brakes, as some of the pressure is absorbed by the compression of the gas in the lines. This makes the brakes feel \"soft\" or \"spongy\" underfoot, and not nearly as reactive or sensitive. After this is used, the brake lines will have to be bled again to remove the remaining air in the system, and replace it completely with hydraulic fluid. The gas canister will be replaced for emergency brake system use in the future. Mention of the anti-skid system is there to throw you off. Anti-skid improves braking by stopping the wheels from locking up, so actually increases brake temperature (or does not affect it, depending on the conditions).",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.08: Describe the sequence for emergency gear extension: unlocking; operating; down-locking. All aircraft are different in their emergency gear extension, but on the whole, the concept is the same. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. Many system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. We are assuming that \"activating the uplocks\" in this sense refers to the mechanical unlocking process of the gear uplocks. This is usually a cable that is pulled from the flight deck by some means, which overcomes the spring tension on the uplock, releasing the gear (and/or gear doors) to extend by gravity. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure (not the selector valves, they are different) Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

REJECTED TAKEOFF (RTO) The RTO mode can be selected (armed) only when on the ground. The RTO mode will engage when a few conditions are met, such as being above 88kts and setting the thrust levers to idle (B737). The airbus A320 doesn't have a named RTO mode, but MAX is only ever used for RTOs and it engages when the ground spoilers deploy, which is at or above 72 kt and with thrust levers set to idle. They are all very similar systems, with small variations. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually. It does not provide a constant rate of deceleration as the landing autobrake modes attempt to do. You could argue that it \"applies the anti-skid maximum braking\" as anti-skid would reduce the brake pressure if the traction is not good enough, but this is not mentioned and we would consider this a less correct answer, particularly after looking at the learning objectives and previous questions.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is quite similar to Q215119, but has a couple of small changes to the question and options, so we have added it separately. The correct answer is the same. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). Autobrakes have quite a simple logic system, depending on their mode of operation, they use the wheel brakes to slow down the aircraft at a pre-determined, constant rate of deceleration (you can think of it as a constant G-force, or a constant amount of knots lost per second). This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

            "explanation": "The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this is done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A means of extending the landing gear and locking it in the down position in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks and hydraulic locks through a mechanical linkage. These can be used to allow the gears to free-fall under their own weight. The weight of the gears will push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position by mechanical means, these down-locks work automatically and mechanically once the gear reaches the down position. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure. Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

As bad as the wording in this question is, the first part is simple. In all aircraft, the landing gear is an active system, in that it requires a power source to function, in this case it is hydraulic pressure that powers it. The landing gear in some aircraft can be lowered passively (gravity extension), but cannot be raised passively. So now for the second part of the question. The power for the hydraulic system in all large aircraft comes from engine driven pumps. These pumps are driven by the auxiliary gearbox connected to one of the engine shafts. Electric hydraulic pumps are also present, and provide the same amount of pressure, but have a much lower displacement as they are much smaller, weaker pumps. Therefore, when landing gear is raised, the vast majority of the load is placed on the engine driven pumps, and is therefore fed by power from the auxiliary gearbox.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objectives 021.04.03.04.04: Describe how an autobrake system setting will either apply maximum braking (RTO or MAX) or result in a given rate of deceleration, where the amount of braking applied may be affected by: the use of reverse thrust; slippery runway. While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

With the wheel connected to the inner cylinder of the oleo, and the aircraft connected to the outer cylinder, there would be no mechanical connection between the two, only a little friction. The torsion link provides that mechanical connection between the inner and the outer cylinder (the wheel and the aircraft) in only one direction, preventing sideways movement, whilst still allowing shock absorption by the oleo in the up and down direction, as it moves in and out due to its \"scissor link\" design. The torsion link does carry lots of stress, therefore, when the aircraft wants to turn and the wheel does not. For example, a main wheel (without steering capability) going round a tight corner where the aircraft wants to twist sideways but the wheel does not. Even more than this, a bogie beam with multiple attached landing gear going round a similarly small corner, would have huge amounts of stress through the torsion link.",

There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

            "explanation": "Pre-flight inspections must confirm whether the condition of the tyre is suitable for operation. Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Note: If you find cuts in the tire, it’s important to make sure that they haven’t cut into the ply of the tire. Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. \"5. Oil contamination on the tyre surface\" Correct. Oil contamination (i.e. brake oil, fuel, tar oil, solvents, chemicals) can degrade the rubber of the tire. Typically, the standard approach involves cleaning the tire with Isopropyl Alcohol. However, if the tire becomes sticky, it becomes necessary to replace the wheel. Hydrocarbons have a detrimental effect on rubber, causing it to lose its essential properties, thereby reducing tire performance.",

            "explanation": "“When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides the capability to select a fixed landing distance” INCORRECT. Only a few aircraft do that, I believe the A350 and A380 – where you can actually go into the computer and say “this is the runway we are landing on, and I actually want to vacate at this specific exit” because it has the runway in the database and all the different taxiways off the runway and, therefore, you can use the autobrake and select to vacate at a certain exit and it will make sure you have the right speed to vacate => but that is not the majority of the aeroplanes. Ultimately, it is not very practical because there are a lot of different factors. On most aircrafts, it just provides a fixed deceleration rate but not a fixed landing distance (seen it is subjected to wind as well). You can never say it will precisely take this xxx amount of distance. Hopefully, this makes sense. “The achievable deceleration levels of full manual braking and the auto-brake RTO mode are the same” CORRECT. So if you press on the pedals as hard as you possibly can, it’s going to give you a maximum deceleration rate and it will also ensure that the wheels don’t lock up – which is exactly the same as autobrake max/RTO. If you look at the pushbutton, it says MAX - maximum amount of braking so it is the same as if you push on the pedals as hard as you can. (Don’t forget that you’ve got antiskid which works in conjunction with autobrake as well) => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. But the thing with the autobrake is that, as soon as the pilot decides to reject the take off and closes the thrust levers, then the maximum braking pressure gets applied immediately. Whereas, if you were to take off without autobrake, and then decided to abort the take-off, you’d first think about “right, I have got to close the thrust levers” and then you’ve got to think to press on the brake pedals => so, there’s obviously an element of delay in that. And that is why the stopping distance in the event of a manual rejected take off would be greater, even though the brake pressure on the brakes, would be exactly the same under both circumstances. Hopefully that kind of makes sense. Video Explanation:",

All the tire needs is a new tread. Airplane tires can be expensive: there is no logical reason to scrap a tire for an aircraft when it can be safely and economically reconditioned with a new tread. This is why retreading has been standard practice in the aviation industry for decades. The maximum retread level for the part number is set only after extensive testing and analysis. Some airplane tyres can be safely retreaded up to seven or more times, but there is always a limit and the limit is always set with an abundance of caution. The retread process is easy to understand. A worn tyre is removed from an aircraft. It is sent back to a retreading firm, often a manufacturer of airplane tires. When the firm receives a tire for retreading it is carefully inspected to ensure that it is safe and economical to retread. The tyre is scrapped if technicians consider there to be doubt about its airworthiness.",

A skid not corrected can quickly lead to a tire blowout, possible damage to the aircraft, and control of the aircraft may be lost. One of the important issues to realize is that the anti-skid system greatly increases the effectiveness of braking. In very simplified terms, the anti-skid system provides the greatest possible brake pressure while not allowing the wheels to lock due to an excessive brake pressure being applied. Without the anti-skid system (manual braking) the braking effectiveness is reduced. \"The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed to provide a slip ratio for maximum braking performance.\" Correct. These systems use a computer that, during ground movement when braking, which constantly compares the measured values of individual wheels (actual rotational speed) with the desired optimum parameters, providing a slip ratio for maximum braking performance. \"If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will be able to achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with anti-skid.\" Incorrect. A pilot will never reach the same performance as a properly functioning anti-skid system. The anti-skid system senses when a brake starts to skid and will reduce braking pressure to avoid the wheels from skidding, a pilot won’t come close to the same performance.",

            "explanation": "“When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm.” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides a constant deceleration during landing on a dry runway. (ignoring possible transition effects when the system begins to function)” CORRECT. The autobrake system varies the brake pressure to achieve a deceleration rate (about 1.7 m/sec2 on the A320 in low autobrake mode). So, when you select “low” autobrake mode in flight, on the landing roll out – it varies the brake pressure to achieve that deceleration rate always. If it is a contaminated runway and it can’t achieve that rate, fundamentally, it will just achieve what it can achieve. “When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed, because maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in the RTO mode.” INCORRECT. I would say that this is a bit type specific. However, saying that the maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in RTO IS NOT CORRECT. => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. The same amount of pressure is accomplished, the only benefit of autobrake is that the braking happens immediately, you do not have to wait for a pilot to respond to it. And, therefore, the braking distance without an autobrake is longer => because of the reaction time. BOTTOM LINE: same deceleration is accomplished, stopping distance in manual braking is greater due to the reaction time.",

The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main hydraulic system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. This is common for large aircraft as their gear are very heavy. Unfortunately, in light aircraft, the gear components are not as heavy, so can get jammed in place with not very much force. This includes the \"blowdown\" system using compressed gasses. The action of emergency gear extension is often a one-way movement, and cannot be reversed. In order to activate the system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through one of the following systems. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. Some emergency extension systems (as mentioned above) use bottles of compressed air or compressed nitrogen to extend the gear, thereby overcoming any small jams that would otherwise keep the gear in the up position. Nitrogen is better as it is non-flammable, and air contains oxygen, which will feed a potential fire. Compressed air is easier (and cheaper) to bottle though. The gear will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical down locks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. The shuttle valve mentioned in this question is a way to feed one actuator with two different pressure sources. When one pressure source loses pressure, the piston can slide across from blocking the emergency source to blocking the usual source, allowing out the emergency pressure to feed the actuator. This can be automatic or manually controlled. A diagram of the shuttle valve is shown in the annex above.",

Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance.",

Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. Manual braking When the anti-skid is inoperative the braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never be as consistent and efficient as the auto-brake with anti-skid would.",

Autobrake For normal operation of the autobrake system, select a deceleration setting. Settings include: MAX - Used when minimum stopping distance is required. Deceleration rate is less than that produced by full manual braking on a dry runway 3 or 4 - Should be used for wet or slippery runways or when landing rollout distance is limited 1 or 2 - These settings provide a moderate deceleration effect suitable for all routine (i.e., not slippery or contaminated runway) operations On a slippery runway the autobrake deceleration rate of 3, 4, although selectable, may not be achievable.

The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

After touchdown, the autobrake will begin braking as soon as the throttle is moved to idle and the wheels start spinning. By utilizing reverse thrust and a low autobrake setting, the brake temperature can be reduced. The use of thrust reversers can help reduce the brake cooling time by reducing the amount of braking required to slow down the aircraft during landing. By using thrust reversers, the engines can be used to help slow the aircraft down, thereby reducing the amount of braking required from the brakes.",

The sidewall is the bit on the side of the tyre that connects the tread to the \"bead\", which is fitted to the wheel rim, it is a very vulnerable section of the tyre, with less protection. Objects embedded in the tyre cause obvious damage to the structural integrity, which could lead to blow outs or slow punctures, both of which are very bad for any ground movements, take off and landing. Note: We are well aware that the pilot should check for both embedded objects and tyre creep when performing their walk around, so would be inclined to appeal this question if it came up in this format. We believe that embedded items are worse than tyre creep, but they should certainly both be checked.

            "explanation": "Important Note: This question is slightly modified from the original feedback received. The original feedback did not compare the multi-disk steel brakes to anything, so was very difficult to answer as the options require comparison to other brakes, however, it was clear from the options that sometimes the examiner was asking about the multi-disk vs single disk element, and sometimes about steel brakes vs carbon brakes. Therefore, We chose to compare them to single disc carbon brakes. The only difference in answer can occur if they compare multi-disc steel brakes to multi-disc carbon brakes directly, in which case the carbon brakes have higher braking strength usually. Please let us know what was actually on the exam if you do see this, and we can adjust it as necessary, thanks! The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them many times, but softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible, and because their wear is more linked to amount of applications, rather than total heat input. In most transport aircraft, the brakes need to absorb vast amounts of heat during landings, rejected take-offs and taxiing, much more than could be absorbed by a single disk and pair of brake pads. Therefore, their brakes are usually made up of multiple (spinning) brake discs separated by multiple (static) rings of brake pads. These multiple rings of stators and rotors can provide much stronger braking and absorb far more heat than a single disc and pair of pads alone, steel or carbon.",

Statement 2: when reverse thrust is activated. Incorrect, the autobrake remains active also when reverse thrust is activated.

There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Please let us know if you see either in the exam, and whatever you can remember about them, thank you! FLY-BY-WIRE In a Fly-By-Wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, moving the flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which significantly enhances safety. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft can change the effect of control inputs to make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. For instance, in the Airbus A320, above 33°, force is needed to maintain the bank angle. The aircraft will not allow bank angles past 67° in normal law. In this question the bank angle protections have activated improperly at 30° AoB, so more force will be required to maintain or increase the angle of bank.",

            "explanation": "As a fully manual flight control system is reversible the pilot feels all forces acting on the control surfaces in the controls. So the pilot must be able to exert sufficient force to overcome the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Normal law is the system mode which is active throughout the flight and is terminated when system failures occur that prevent its use. The highest reduced mode of operation in Airbus FBW systems is the Alternate Law, which provides most features of normal law. Some features such as automatic stall protection are lost and replaced by conventional warnings for the pilots to manually correct the condition. This means that flight envelope protection is degraded as avionics no longer limit the pilot input to avoid stall. Should failure conditions prevent operation in Alternate Law, an even more basic Direct Law is available. Autopilot functions are lost, along with flight envelope protection. As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power. As we have stated above, a system degradation results in a loss of protection features, so the required alertness of the crew increases and leads to a higher workload.",

The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting.

Thankfully, this topic is not particularly complicated so the more questions about this, the better. In a fly-by-wire system such as the Airbus A320, amongst others, both pilots have a sidestick which is a major input into the fly-by-wire control system. As these sidesticks are not mechanically linked like other, there needs to be a way for both pilots to make inputs at once. The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own priority button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

            "explanation": "Fly-By-Wire systems A Fly-By-Wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of a late go-around like this one, the recommended way to go around remains the same amongst all aircraft, apply TOGA thrust (or sometimes less if full TOGA thrust is not required), pitch up to a suitable go-around attitude (somewhere around 15° initially), retract flaps if necessary, and begin climbing, then \"clean up\" the rest of the aircraft (gain speed, gear up, retract flaps further, etc.). For that initial reaction though, Fly-By-Wire flight envelope protections could perhaps be useful. Because of the stall protection of a fly-by-wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply TO/GA thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will likely go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), so the aircraft will climb, but the system will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: This would be a very aggressive manoeuvre, and similar to terrain or windshear escape manoeuvres, which would cause the pilots far more issues later on than if they just performed a normal go-around, so this is not the way a pilot should actually fly a go-around in a fly-by-wire aircraft, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing Fly-By-Wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems. Whilst pulling back on the stick with caution is quite advisable (as per one of the other options), it does not need to be gentle, particularly for a late go-around, and it is not to stop the aircraft stalling really, as the Fly-By-Wire stops that.",

Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer would could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional computers and hydraulic systems.",

Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed inscreases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder peddals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system reduces the rudder deflection for a given rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Incorrect. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted.",

Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "\"I. A gust lock can be used in flight to reduce the effects of turbulence.\" Incorrect. A gust lock is essentially a device which limits the movement of a control surface while the aeroplane is parked, preventing damage when it is unattended. It stops aicraft's surfaces from being slammed back and forth in a strong wind/gusts. Typically it is the ailerons, the elevator and the rudder that are of concern. In many aircraft, the control column that supports the yoke can be immobilized in the cockpit with a heavy pin that slides through aligned holes in the column itself, thereby restarting the elevator and ailerons from moving at all. There is also a style of gust lock that attaches directly to the base of the rudder and holds it immobile. It is clearly essential that all flight control locks are removed/disengaged before flight. \"II. Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock.\" Correct. A reversible control system is a power assisted system in which the pilot is connected directly to the controls, feeling part of the load. It is called \"reversible\" because if someone moves the external surfaces, the stick (or control column) and the peddals move inside the cockpit. Control surfaces move freely and in case of strong wind, for example, they may be slammed back and forth, which may cause aircraft damage. For that reason, a gust lock system should be used, inside the aircraft and/or outside.",

Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. This means that flap asymmetry will roll the aircraft towards the cleaner wing (fewer flaps), as the wing with flaps down is producing much more lift than it. It also means that the aircraft will have asymmetric drag, and will want to yaw towards the wing with flaps down, as the flaps are causing extra drag that the clean wing is not producing. This means that the yaw is in the opposite direction from the roll.",

This is to allow for redundancy in the system, and no \"one point of failure\".

Flight envelope protection is what is being discussed in this question. An aircraft with fly-by-wire operating in normal law will have a full suite of stall protections. These mean that the system will not let the pilot stall the aircraft by pulling back too hard or too far with the sidestick. It also protects the aircraft from pulling more than the limit load factor. This means that during a terrain escape manoeuvre, when the aim is to gain as much altitude as possible in the shortest distance, the pilot can just pull back on the sidestick to full deflection, and the fly-by-wire system will ensure a controlled pitch up to a high (but safe) pitch angle, allowing the speed to reduce to the point where the aircraft reaches \"max alpha\", and then the aircraft will pitch down to maintain that angle of attack. Whether this is an approved way of performing a terrain escape manoeuvre is irrelevant to the question, which is simply testing your technical knowledge of fly-by-wire systems.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer.",

Secondary flight controls such as flaps, slats, and spoilers often contain maximum speed limits for their use, due to the fact that they stick into the airflow, which will exert significant force on them due to dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure exerted is proportional to the square of the air velocity, so for a doubling of speed, the dynamic pressure increases by x4. If the secondary flight controls were extended past their maximum speed, the devices and the mechanisms keeping them in place could be overpowered or may be permanently damaged. For spoilers, they are subject to huge amounts of dynamic pressure as part of their job \"spoiling\" the airflow over the wing, so are particularly susceptible to this. Note: The spoilers/speedbrakes on an aircraft wing are usually secondary flight controls, but when roll spoilers are active, the roll spoilers are actually classed as primary flight controls because they are acting as ailerons.",

A full stabilizer deflection could prevent the aircraft from returning to a safe landing. A Runaway Pitch Trim can be fatal in flight because it would run the horizontal stabilizer either up or down to its mechanical stops, and the use of the elevators would not be sufficient to overcome this force. In most Electrical Trim systems, two toggle switches are required for a stabilizer trim system, where one of them releases the trim brake and the other one drives the motor. You must use both to activate the stabilizer trim - they are designed in such a way on the control column that if you trim, you will always push them together. The reason you need double trim switches is primarily to prevent Trim Runaway on the stabilizer, if one switch runs away then the other can be used to stop it.",

Modern transport aircraft must be equipped with safeguards to prevent loss of control in the event of hydraulic or electrical failure. This is typically achieved by incorporating redundancy into the control system. One common method of redundancy is splitting control surfaces into two or three sections, each powered by separate actuators and hydraulic systems. In addition, computer system redundancy is also provided in some modern transport aircraft, such as Airbus aircraft. In a large transport aircraft with fully powered primary flight controls, redundancy can be achieved by having multiple flight control computers linked to multiple actuators supplied by different power sources. This configuration ensures that, in the event of a single-point failure, the aircraft's control surfaces remain operable and the pilots can continue to control the aircraft safely.",

CORRECT: The zero force position will not change when using pitch (elevator) trim Statement 2: The zero force position of the control wheel does not change when using the aileron trim. INCORRECT: The zero force position will change when using the aileron trim. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This computer’s output will be the input for an electrically controlled hydro-mechanical unit, a hydraulic motor, which drive the transmission which moves the flaps. The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed.

            "explanation": "Boeing and Airbus call these a bit different but the principle stays the same. Airbus has the following laws: Normal law Flight control Normal Law provides three axis control, flight envelope protection and manoeuver load alleviation. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode, Flight Mode, Flare Mode Alternate law Alternate Law 1 (ALT1) combines Normal Law lateral mode with Alternate Law pitch modes. Low Energy Protection is replaced by Low Speed Stability meaning that the aircraft no longer has automatic stall protection. At low speed, a nose down demand is introduced based on IAS (instead of AOA) and Alternate Law changes to Direct Law. In addition, an audio \"STALL\" warning is introduced. α-Floor protection is not available so conventional pilot stall recovery action is required. Load Factor and Bank Angle Protections are retained. High Speed and High Angle of Attack Protections enter Alternate Law mode. Pitch Attitude Protection is lost. ALT1 control law degradation will result from some faults in the horizontal stabilizer, a single elevator fault, loss of a yaw-damper actuator, loss of slat or flap position sensors or a single air data reference fault. Dependent upon the failure, autopilot may not be available. In Alternate Law 2 (ALT2), Normal Law lateral mode is lost and is replaced by roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch mode is in Alternate Law. Load factor protection is retained. In addition to those protections lost in ALT1 (Pitch Attitude and Low Energy Protection), Bank Angle Protection is also lost. In some failure cases, High Angle of Attack and High Speed Protections will also be lost. As is the case with ALT1, some failure cases that result in ALT2 will also cause the autopilot to disconnect. ALT2 is entered when both engines flame out, with faults in two inertial or two air-data reference units, with faults to all spoilers, certain aileron faults or with a pedal transducers fault Direct law In Direct Law (DIR), lateral modes are the same as ALT2; that is roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch control degrades to Direct Law and automatic trim is inoperative requiring stab trim to be adjusted manually by the pilot. Control surface motion is directly related to the sidestick motion. ALL protections are lost. In Direct Law, autopilot function is always lost. DIR is entered if there is failure of all three inertial reference units or all three primary flight computers, faults in both elevators or flame out of both engines concurrent with loss of PRIM 1. Boeing uses: Normal mode In Normal mode during manual flight, the ACEs receive pilot control inputs and send these signals to the three PFCs. The PFCs verify these signals and utilise information from other airplane systems in order to compute control surface commands. These commands are then sent back to the ACEs which then send the enhanced signals to the flight control surface actuators which convert them into analog servo commands. Full functionality is provided including all enhanced performance, envelope protection and ride quality features. When the autopilot is engaged, the autopilot system sends commands to the PFCs. The PFCs generate control surface commands which are sent to the ACEs in the same manner as pilot control inputs. The autopilot commands move the flight deck controls to provide autopilot feedback to the pilots. If a pilot overrides the autopilot with control inputs, the PFCs will disengage the autopilot and utilise the pilot control inputs. Note that the autopilot is not available should reversion to Secondary or Direct mode occur. Secondary mode Boeing Secondary mode is somewhat similar to the Airbus Alternate Law. When the PFCs cannot support Normal mode operation due to internal faults or to loss of information from other aircraft systems, they automatically revert to Secondary mode. Reversion to Secondary mode results in the loss of the autopilot and the pilots must control the aircraft manually. The ACEs still receive pilot control inputs and send the appropriate signals to the PFCs. However, due to the degraded mode of operation, the PFCs use \"simplified\" computations to generate the flight control surface commands. These commands are sent back to the ACEs from where they are sent to the flight control surfaces in the same manner as during Normal mode operations. Aircraft handling qualities are affected by the simplified computations or PFC control laws that are utilised in Secondary mode. While all flight control surfaces remain operative, the elevator and rudder are more sensitive at some airspeeds. The following functions are inoperative or degraded during Secondary mode operations: autopilot auto speedbrakes envelope protection gust suppression tail strike protection thrust asymmetry compensation yaw damping Direct mode The ACEs automatically revert to Direct mode when they detect the failure of all three PFCs or when they are unable to communicate with the PFCs. Direct mode can also be manually selected by selecting the DISC position on the Primary Flight Computers Disconnect switch. In Direct mode, the PFCs no longer generate control surface commands. Pilot inputs are received by the ACEs and sent directly to the flight control surface actuators. Direct mode allows for full aircraft control while in flight and during the landing phase. Aircraft handling characteristics are very similar to those encountered while in Secondary mode. In addition to those functions lost during Secondary mode operations (as listed previously) the manual rudder trim cancel switch is inoperative.",

            "explanation": "Refer to the figure The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. In the figure in the annex you can see the schematic of a feel system. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Therefore, in a Fly-By-Wire system, the control surfaces are moved indirectly by the pilot inputs via a computer, which makes the system irreversible.

Advantages of Fly-By-Wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure G forces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer, which could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional sensors, computers and hydraulic systems. A flight control system must not be allowed to have a single point of failure, so there is a large amount of extra redundancy built-in, which allows multiple different failures before the FBW system becomes inoperative.",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control).

CORRECT: If an aircraft would take off with a gust lock engaged one or more flight controls would not work. Statement 2: There is no need for a gust lock on reversible flight controls. INCORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed.

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with even a medium sized flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps/slats from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, which will hydraulically deflect a flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to FBW systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW also enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which, provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft has the ability to change the control inputs to keep the aircraft within its safe flight envelope, and can therefore make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. The system would not override the pilot too much, and in dire situations the pilot may require high bank angles, which would still be possible in a FBW aircraft, as not to degrade safety.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-By-Wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

Priority takeover is added as the sidesticks are not mechanically linked so the pilots must be able to decide who is controlling the aircraft manually, as dual inputs can otherwise occur. to disconnect the autopilot when engaged in \"command\" (i.e. the aircraft is automatically flying), this red button can be pushed, the autopilot can be de-selected on the control panel (the flight-deck glareshield panel), or the pilot can simply make a large enough input on the sidestick, which will also disengage the autopilot and allow the pilot to control the aircraft manually. The pilot cannot and must not disconnect the FBW system entirely, as this would leave the aircraft with no elevator or aileron control, and very limited mechanical reversion control.",

CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: There is no need for a gust lock on a fully manual flight control system. INCORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Normal law is the system mode which is active throughout the flight and is terminated when system failures occur that prevent its use. The highest reduced mode of operation in Airbus FBW systems is the Alternate Law, which provides most features of normal law. Some features such as automatic stall protection are lost and replaced by conventional warnings for the pilots to manually correct the condition. Should failure conditions prevent operation in Alternate Law, an even more basic Direct Law is available. Autopilot functions are lost, along with flight envelope protection. As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power. As we have stated above, a system degradation results in a loss of protection features, so the required alertness of the crew increases and leads to a higher workload.",

They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and Fly-By-Wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals. That would be the case for any irreversible control system, but the rudder pedals would also move if the system were reversible.",

Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with a large flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. The figure above shows the allowed deflection of a particular aircraft. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer. The reason that statement 2 is incorrect is that it says the limitations to rudder/rudder pedal deflection occur with decreasing airspeed, but actually it is with increasing airspeed.",

The A320 is a typical example of an aircraft with a FBW system in which all surfaces are actuated hydraulically and are electrically or mechanically controlled. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY (figure 2) Safeguards to eliminate the possibility of loss of control in the event of hydraulic or electrical failure must be provided on modern transport aircraft. This is generally achieved by building some form of redundancy into the control system. Splitting the control surfaces into two or three sections, each powered by separate actuators and hydraulic systems is the usual method. The A320 (EASA's usual favourite aircraft) has 2 actuators per aileron aswell, an active and a \"damping\", which can be used in the event of the failure of the active. Important Note: This question is far too ambiguous about the aircraft in question and the fault that has occured. We have to go to the level of the learning objectives, and try to see what the examiner wants from us. They want us to know that there are multiple computers for each system, so in this event, the system can switch computers, and redundancy in the rest of the system allows us to use a different actuator aswell. This is not true for all FBW aircraft, but going off the feedback, this is what EASA want from us.",

FBW systems can be lighter than a conventional system as FBW does not require the heavy control cables. Including FBW provides a significant reduction in fuel consumption. The FBW systems also provide flight envelope protection by preventing the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack. It will also allow the pilot to operate the controls positively up to the 2.5g limit without fear of overstressing the aircraft.",

Fly-By-Wire flight controls offer many benefits to an aircraft, one of the largest being the addition of flight envelope protection. Provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, this significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, Fly-By-Wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, from automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed (alpha prot.) all the way up to alpha max, which the pilots cannot physically exceed (whilst in normal law). These protections reduce pilot workload, by allowing the pilots to think about things other than flying the aircraft near the stall. This could allow the pilots to complete checks or drills and secure the situation.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-by-wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted (partially powered) control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

            "explanation": "A fully manual flight control system would be a reversible control system, meaning the forces applied on the controls are the forces moving the control surfaces and vice versa. This are connected by mechanical links only and aren’t powered in any way. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Flight spoilers Flight spoilers are fitted on the upper side of the surface of the wing which can be raised. They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

For large transport aircraft the most used is the slotted Fowler flaps. (see different types in the image in the annex) In the cockpit there will be a selector where the pilot selects the desired flap setting, the input from this selector will be the input for the slat/flap control computers which control, test and monitor the operation of the flaps and slats. This computer’s output will be the input for an electrically controlled hydro-mechanical unit, a hydraulic motor, which drive the transmission which moves the flaps. The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting. If the main hydraulic system fails, the emergency operation might be via an alternate hydraulic system or an electric motor which operates the same gear train as the normal operating system.",

The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own prioirty button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Statement 1: There is no need for a gust lock on irreversible flight controls. CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: A fully manual flight control system should have a gust lock. CORRECT: fully manual flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This is the system in operation during normal flights. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode Flight Mode Flare Mode Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability, load factor and stall protections. Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft. Note: Type related questions are out of the scope of ATPL learning objectives.

            "explanation": "On some aeroplanes, take-off is prevented with a gust lock engaged. This is the correct answer and to reply to the comments, some aircraft have gust locks in place which prevent the movement of the throttle. So this is what’s meant with take-off is prevented. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed inscreases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder peddals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system limits both rudder and rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Correct. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted.",

This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (the same as powered steering in a car). The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals. That would be the case for any irreversible control system, but the rudder pedals would also move if the system were reversible. Therefore, the flight controls on the aircraft described must be fully powered, out of that selection of options.",

Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft. Note: Type related questions are out of the scope of ATPL learning objectives.

Each flap setting has a VFE speed, which is the maximum flaps extended speed. Above this speed, the flaps will take too much load, and could be damaged. Modern jet transport aircraft often have a flap load relief system, which detects flap overspeed, and can disengage the flap lock, allowing the airflow to push the flaps to a lower setting, or some intermediate value, so that the flaps do not get damaged. Some systems use hydraulic pressure and physically move the flaps using the standard system, whereas others use the \"blowback\" system mentioned above.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.05.05: Explain the concept of a rudder deflection limitation (rudder limiter) system and the various means of implementation (rudder ratio changer, variable stops, blow-back). One of the problems with rudders is that they need to be very large and have a large maximum deflection for adequate directional control in the case of an engine failure during take-off or at low speeds, when there is very little airflow, but if this large rudder had a large deflection at the high cruise speeds of a jet aircraft, it could easily break the tail of the aircraft off with the extreme forces. There are a few methods to remove this problem, rudder ratio changers, variable stops, and blow-back. Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. This rudder ratio changer can be continuous, as described above, or can be a discreet change at a certain airspeed, like changing gears in a car. If this automatic reduction in rudder authority is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Conversely, if the rudder remains in the high-speed, low deflection mode, then there will be insufficient rudder authority to handle engine failures and crosswind landings at low speeds. This means that the approach will have added limitations, such as a higher minimum approach speed and a reduced crosswind limit. The annex above is an extract from the ATR 72 FCOM, an aircraft which does have a discreet rudder ratio changer (called a TLU - Travel Limiting Unit - in the manual) that changes rudder deflection at 180 kts, and the procedure for if a fault occurs. Notice that within the area of the red box, the procedure for if the fault is not resolved (or unsure if resolved) is to increase the VAPP (approach speed) by 10 kt (with associated increased landing distance) and land at an airport with the lowest crosswind, max demonstrated crosswind is 15 kt. To address the other options: The maximum operating speed will not increase, only the minimum. The rudder authority will be less than usual. The flap setting would not need to be greater, as the approach will be faster, so if anything, less flaps may be needed.",

But here we go, statement 1 is definitely incorrect: \"1) disengage FBW.\" INCORRECT. FBW describes those flight control systems which use computers to process the flight control inputs made by the pilot or autopilot, and send corresponding electrical signals to the flight control surface actuators. It is definitely not possible to disengage the FBW. \"2) press and hold priority button.\" CORRECT. The sidestick priority logic is only valid when the autopilot is disconnected as it manages who has control when sidestick inputs are made on both sidesticks at the same time. If you press that button at any time it disconnects the autopilot. Press and hold it you have priority. Computers will disregard the other sidestick’s inputs. Press it continuously for 40 secs and it permanently locks the other sidestick out unless the other pilot presses his button. \"3) disengage on MCP.\" CORRECT. I believe they might be referring to the A/P disengage bar which is found on the MCP of Boeing airplanes. If you press this bar down, the A/P disengages. \"4) forcefully move the control column.\" CORRECT.

            "explanation": "Flight controls Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trim wheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Fly-By-Wire (FBW) systems have several advantages over conventional mechanical flight control systems. Wires and electronic connections are significantly lighter than mechanical structural elements. The reduced weight allows for fitting redundant components, most sophisticated systems feature redundant flight control computers and separate computer systems for flight control without making control systems too heavy. Moreover, FBW system computers offer very sophisticated flight-envelope protections. The computers limit the orders to ensure the protection limits are not exceeded. FBW control systems incorporate redundancy on all levels of the control system. Increased number of systems allows safe continuation of flight in case of a system loss.",

When using the elevator (pitch) trim, the entire horizontal tail moves and therefore the zero force point will stay the same. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Note: We think that the different authorities have different versions of this question. Some mention that it is a Fly By Wire aircraft, some saying Airbus, and some saying specifically A320. It is the same answer for all these, and EASA are usually talking about A320s when they mention Fly By Wire anyway. We think the questions are similar enough to warrant only this one in the bank, but if further feedback says otherwise, we will add separate questions. Fly By Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of Fly By Wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. This question used to be very ambiguous, but over the past year it has changed a few times, and now we know it is an Airbus (we believe it says A320 in some exam authorities) and it is flying at the critical angle of attack. As it is at its critical angle of attack, pulling back on the sidestick would make it initially attempt to climb, but as this would further increase the angle of attack and slow the aircraft, the flight envelope protections would step in and stop this pitching backwards. Therefore the only thing that can save us from this scenario is actually adding thrust. This will allow us to increase our speed, decreasing our AoA, and subsequently, the flight controls will allow us to begin a climb. This is the only way to induce any sort of climb from the very low energy state of the question. In fact, the Airbus A320 actually has a set of limiting angles of attack, where different measures will be taken one by one to stop an impending stall. One of those measures is automatically applying TO/GA (Take off/Go around) thrust. You are not expected to know this for the question, so do not assume that the aircraft will automatically do this if you keep pulling back. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.03.05: Explain the operating principle of rudder and aileron trim in a fully powered control system. There are two basic types of flight controls, reversible and irreversible. Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor is that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against, the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. There are pros and cons to both, but one benefit of irreversible controls such as fly by wire, is that trimming can be made easier. All a simple trim system needs to do is adjust where the system considers the \"zero\" point to be. Therefore the rudder (in this case) will sit naturally at the new \"zero\" point, which will produce a constant trim in a particular direction. Pitch trim can differ from this method though, and some manufacturers take their own stance on trimming, such as if the rudder pedals are supposed to move with the trim or not, etc.",

The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of severe windshear, the recommended way to gain altitude and escape the windshear is to apply maximum thrust and pitch up to a high attitude until reaching near the stall speed, then maintain that speed. In theory, a Fly-By-Wire aircraft can actually perform some of that for the pilot. Because of the stall protection of a Fly-By-Wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply full thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), but will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: this is not the way an Airbus pilot should actually fly a windshear escape manoeuvre, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing fly-by-wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems.",

            "explanation": "(Elevator gust lock, Aileron gust lock, Rudder gust lock) Statement 1: There should be suitable design precautions to prevent flight with the gust lock engaged. CORRECT: If an aircraft would take off with a gust lock engaged one or more flight controls would not work. Statement 2: Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock. CORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

As Fly-By-Wire control systems have no manual back-up systems, and flight controls can be lost due to loss of power, loss of computers, loss of hydraulics, etc., they have multiple redundant systems to prevent this. In reality, they end up having more redundancy than some simpler systems, in the amount of separate systems that can be used as backups. For this question then, the correct answer is actually that FBW aircraft benefit from increased damage tolerance. Now we strongly believe that it very much depends on the type of damage and its location, but when you consider that FBW aircraft usually have 3 hydraulic systems and 3-4 flight control computers, you can see where the examiner is coming from.

Slats Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed-wing aircraft which, when deployed, allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack. At high angles of attack they allow the air over the wing to have much greater energy, allowing the aircraft to fly at much higher angles of attack without stalling. This allows the wing to produce a higher maximum coefficient of lift, and can therefore fly slower whilst still balancing the weight force with lift. Slats, like flaps, are therefore used for take-off, landing and slow flight, thereby reducing take-off and landing distances. Slats are still retracted for normal flight as they increase drag, similar to flaps. They are hydraulically powered, just like the flaps and other flight controls on large aircraft. Some aircrafts are equipped with an Auto-Slat System. This system enhances the airplane stalling characteristics. Upon receiving a signal from the stall warning system that the aircraft is close to the stall (high AoA), the auto-slat system automatically operates the slats, extending them from the midrange position to the fully extended landing position. The slats retract a few seconds after the signal is removed. This is a bit like a \"get out of jail free\" card, and allows a few extra degrees angle of attack before the wing completely stalls.",

Means of control The pressurization can be controlled either automatically or manually. When the system is set to automatic, the system uses the pressure controllers which in most commercial aircraft are electronic. When the cabin pressure changes the controller sends a signal to the outflow valves whether to open or close. These valves are then positioned to a position to achieve a selected rate of pressure increase or decrease. Some aircraft have a ditching mode which will close all valves to avoid water flowing into the cabin in the event of a forced landing on water. The outflow valves are fitted with two AC motors, these are used with automatic control, and one DC motor for manual or emergency operation. When the pressure is controlled manually all automatic functions will be disabled and enables the outflow valves to be positioned with the DC motor. So manual mode has a separate circuit for the operation.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

The outflow valves are positioned to regulate the release of air from the cabin at the pre-selected rate to achieve the required differential pressure and eventual stabilization at the selected cabin altitude.

Often referred to as \"air conditioning packs\". In Air Cycle Machines, high-pressure bleed air from the engines is first pre-cooled in the primary heat exchanger. The bleed air is then compressed in the compressor section and is then fed through to the secondary heat exchanger to remove as much heat as possible before being expanded and introduced to the turbine section which is used to drive the compressor. After passing through the turbine section, the air is then ducted through a water separator to remove excess moisture from the conditioned air before it enters the cabin and cockpit via a one way check valve. Finally, the air passes through a humidifier to increase the moisture content of the conditioning air. As discussed above, the temperature reduction of the air inside the system is accomplished by air passing through heat exchangers. Heat exchangers normally use ram air as the cooling medium. In flight, ram air doors are modulated to increase or decrease ram air flow to the exchanger. During slow flight or when on the ground, a \"ground cooling fan\" is responsible to draw air through the ram air duct so that the heat exchange is possible when the aircraft is stationary.",

Often referred to as \"air conditioning packs\". In Air Cycle Machines, high-pressure bleed air from the engines is first pre-cooled in the primary heat exchanger. The bleed air is then compressed in the compressor section and is then fed through to the secondary heat exchanger to remove as much heat as possible before being expanded and introduced to the turbine section which is used to drive the compressor. After passing through the turbine section, the air is then ducted through a water separator to remove excess moisture from the conditioned air before it enters the cabin and cockpit via a one way check valve. Finally, the air passes through a humidifier to increase the moisture content of the conditioning air. As discussed above, the temperature reduction of the air inside the system is accomplished by air passing through heat exchangers. Heat exchangers normally use ram air as the cooling medium. In flight, ram air doors are modulated to increase or decrease ram air flow to the exchanger. During slow flight or when on the ground, a \"ground cooling fan\" is responsible to draw air through the ram air duct so that the heat exchange is possible when the aircraft is stationary.",

Pressurization System control methods The way the pressure in the aircraft is controlled is by having a constant mass of air entering the cabin through the airconditioning system. This mass of air is kept constant by the mass flow controller. The pressure is regulated by the amount of air which is discharged back to the atmosphere by the outflow valves. So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential. These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed.",

The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control.

            "explanation": "Most jet aircraft have pneumatic systems with 2 separate air conditioning packs. These usually use bleed air that has been taken from that side engine's compressor, thereby having a left pack which runs from left engine bleed air, and a right pack which runs off air from the right hand engine(s). The APU also feeds bleed air into the pneumatic system (usually to the left side). In the air, the system should operate normally with no interaction between the left and right side. There is an isolation valve between the two systems to either make them interconnected or completely separate. This is usually open on the ground when the engines are off to provide APU bleed air to both packs for cooling and to both engines for starting. It is closed in the air for split operation, unless an abnormal situation occurs, such as a loss of engine bleed air, pack failure, etc., when the isolation valve will either automatically be opened or the flight crew will open it to balance the load within the system. A significant pressure difference between the two sides of an isolation valve in the air is likely to mean that one of the sides has an issue that the other does not have. In the case of the Boeing 737 specifically (image shown above), the isolation valve opens automatically if any of the pack or engine bleed switches are NOT in their normal locations (bleeds on, packs auto) as the system knows that the pneumatics will become unbalanced in that case (bleed off, pack off, or pack set to high flow, etc.). It can be manually forced open or closed though by positioning the switch each side of the \"AUTO\" position. It is not good to feed bleed air into a leaky duct, though, so that is something to be careful of with pressure differentials. As for the other options: \"They close when the system pressure equals the environmental pressure.\" This is talking roughly about the pressurisation outflow valve. That is what controls the pressure in the cabin. \"They open when there is a leak in one of the systems.\" This is a bad thing, as we do not want to feed hot bleed air into a leaky air duct, due to overheating and potential loss of pressurisation. \"They close when the engines are at maximum thrust.\" Engines at high thrust produce more bleed air, but they will produce it to both sides of the pneumatic manifold, so isolation valve open or closed, it shouldn't make too much difference.",

It makes use of engine bleed air or APU pneumatic air during the conditioning process. Another system is electrically powered air conditioning which can be found in Boeing 787. Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Reduced fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no guidance on whether the initial cost of the electric-pneumatic system is cheaper than similar bleed air systems, and any engine system that reduced the take off distance would increase (not reduce) the climb gradient. The change in de-icing capabilities depends on the system. Ease of use also depends on the system. Bleed air pneumatic systems are quite easy to use so the difference will be minimal if there is one.",

Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 an 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude.",

It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. This is why there are often a few sensors throughout the aircraft, placed near to the pneumatic pipes, which detect an overheat and inform the flight crew of a likely leak. Note: The correct answer here seems remarkably easy, but it is direct from the feedback wording. We think other similar correct options could be a bleed leak sensor, duct overheat sensor, body overheat sensor, or something of that manner. Certainly read all the options in the exam to make sure none are possible (the bleed air pressure and temperature would NOT rise, and the oil temperature has no connection at all).",

Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Improved range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There are no significant control differences between two systems, a similar control panel is used and they have similar anti-icing/de-icing capabilities.

It makes use of engine bleed air or APU pneumatic air during the conditioning process. Another system is electrically powered air conditioning which can be found in Boeing 787. Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Improved fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no significant control differences between two systems, similar control panel is used and de-icing capabilities. An electrically driven air conditioning system does not increase take off distance.",

Vapour Cycle air is used on most nonturbine aircraft that are equipped with air conditioning. However, it is not a source of pressurising air. The vapour cycle system only cools the cabin. It differs from the other systems in that the cooling of the charge air is mainly achieved by a refrigerant. \"Air from the turbine of the turbocharger\" is incorrect because the air from the turbine is already highly compressed and hot, which makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose. \"Ram air and an electric fan\" is incorrect as the vapor-cycle system does not operate using ram air or an electric fan for its cooling process. \"A vapour-cycle machine is a closed system, therefore a separate air source is not required.\" is incorrect because a vapor-cycle system necessitates an external source of high-pressure and high-temperature air to facilitate the cooling of the refrigerant and other components.

Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 and 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude. Control. Achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10 000 ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000 ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500 ft/min for the climb and 300 ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

In piston engine aircraft, different sources of air supply can be used, such as compressors, blowers or vacuum pumps. Those devices are driven by small electrical motors or directly by the engine and provide air for some instruments, de-icing and cabin. Compressors are able to handle more air while blowers and vacuum systems are used for lower demands. Ram air turbine may be used on larger aircraft as a backup hydraulic power source. Bleed air provides air supply for a gas turbine engine. Turbocharger is not necessarily running all the time and therefore would be of no use as air supply. Note: Superchargers can be used to provide pneumatic pressure, as they are effectively the same thing as an air compressor, just one that is usually used to provide extra Manifold Pressure to the engine intake air. This is why some textbooks and questions do refer to them as possible pneumatic pressure sources, but compressor pump is much more correct than turbocharger here, as turbochargers are not always working in an engine.",

Locate the value of 38 000 ft in the first column on the left => continue horizontally to the right and read the corresponding pressure 2.99 PSI. The maximum allowed pressure differential is 8.17 PSI - that means that the cabin pressure is \"outside air pressure (2.99) + differential pressure (8.17)= 11.16 PSI\" Cabin altitude corresponding to 11.16 psi is found by interpolating 7000-8000 ft and 11.34-10.92 PSI. For the 0.42 PSI change between 11.34 PSI (7000 ft) and 10.92 (8000 ft) PSI, the change in altitude is 1000 ft in total. So each 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft. We can calculate 11.16 PSI cabin pressure based on 11.34 PSI or 10.92 PSI. Let's base it on 11.34 PSI. The difference between this and the cabin pressure we calculated is 0.18 (11.34 - 11.16) PSI. Since every 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft, a change of 0.18 PSI causes an altitude change of 429 ft (23.81 x 18). If we add this value to our base altitude (7000 ft), the result is 7429 ft. (We added it because the altitude increases as the PSI decreases) The closest answer is 7430 ft.",

As both would actually be covered by the same correct answer, there is no problem. We strongly believe that it is talking about pressure control, but we can cover all bases here anyway. Temperature control of the air conditioning system in a jet transport aircraft comes from controlling the mixing of two streams of air - hot and cold - whch come from different stages of the bleed air conditioning packs. Some aircraft have automatic valves to control the internal temperature of the air, if this does not work, the valve can sometimes be manually controlled from the flight deck. This all depends on the aircraft type of course. PRESSURISATION SYSTEMS Cabin pressurization is achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. The operation of the outflow valves is governed by the pressure controller when in automatic control => as the cabin pressure changes, the controller automatically transmits a signal to the outflow valves. If the automatic control fails, the position of the outflow valve can be controlled by the flight crew in manual mode => the outflow valve position can be varied by means of the main outflow valve control and with reference to the cabin altitude gauge and the valve position indicator.",

So the difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure. With a drop in cabin pressure the difference between the cabin pressure and ambient pressure will decrease. Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10000ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500ft/min for the climb and 300ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

Therefore, the usual (and very easy) answer of the bleed air duct leak indicator light is no longer correct, because there is no such light in the cabin, only in the flight deck. The bleed air in the pneumatic system is usually fed from a \"bleed air source\" in a gas turbine engine, which is effectively just air that has already gone through some of the compressor stages and is siphoned off to pressurise the system (not burnt). It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. Thankfully, it is usually kept far away from passengers, for just this reason, so the first sign of a duct leak in the cabin would likely be reduction in airflow coming through the vents. This is because less air is fed into the air conditioning packs (as some of it has leaked out), so less air is able to be cooled and sent to the cabin vents. The cabin pressure will not drop rapidly as the loss of pressurisation is small, depending on the location of the duct leak, and the outflow valve will close naturally to keep the remaining pressure inside. It could be argued that the cabin temperature could rise above normal limits, but this is highly dependent on the location of the leak. The majority of the bleed air lines exist in the wings and underbelly of the aircraft (mostly unpressurised areas) so the chance of the passenger cabin being heated by this is quite slim, but some aircraft equipment could certainly be damaged.",

Most aircraft are equipped with a defroster consisting of vents that direct heated air across the windshield on the inside of the cabin. To prevent ice formation, most windshields are electrically heated: small wires or electrically conductive materials are embedded in the windshield or in a panel of glass installed over the exterior of the windshield. By passing electric current through the windshield or panel, sufficient heat is produced to prevent ice formation. OTHER ICE CONTROL SYSTEMS.

On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. Anti-ice systems in turbine-type engines often use engine bleed air to prevent ice formation by heating or otherwise managing the temperature of critical components to ensure safe and efficient engine operation.",

Piezoelectric sensors are very interesting. They create a linkage between movement and electric signals via the stress of a particular \"piezoelectric\" crystal. In this case, they are used to measure vibrations of an ice detection sensor. This is usually a small rod that sticks out from the aircraft fuselage and vibrates at the natural frequency of the rod, but any ice buildup will cause that natural frequency to change, and this change will be sensed by the piezoelectric crystal, triggering a warning for the pilots that ice buildup has been detected.",

On many reciprocating-engine and turboprop airplanes, de-icing boots are pneumatically inflated to break the ice, which allows it to be carried away by the airstream.

The different parts of the aircraft that require ice protection are the wing leading edges, the tail leading edges, any probes or vanes, the windscreen, the engine inlets and the propellers (if fitted). All these components can be de-iced when ice is detected, except for the engines, which have to be anti-iced, as any ice build up could fall into the engine when dislodged and potentially cause a flame out or even damage. On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. As for this question, the answers beginning with \"prevents\" are correct (anti-icing rather than de-icing), and the ice does not form on the trailing edge of a wing (it can flow over the trailing edge in extreme cases but does not \"form\" there), so therefore the correct answer has to be that it \"prevents the formation of ice on engine inlets.\"",

Learning Objective 021.07.02.01.02: Describe the principle of operation of ice warning systems. Some aircraft are fitted with ice detection systems which show the pilots a warning when ice acccumulation has been detected, often on a small probe. Some aircraft rely simply on visual references, such as the buildup of ice on the windshield wipers, or other items within view of the pilots. This is a design consideration of the aircraft, and the pilots must be able to see indications of ice accretion as they occur, particularly in large jet aircraft where the pilot cannot see the wing easily. As the ice warning is a design consideration, the indications of icing should be visible when the pilot has the correct eye reference position. If they do not have the correct eye position, then they may not be able to see the ice build up, preventing them from performing the correct procedures.",

In fact, the mass flow of air will be reduced, which will increase the engine’s overall temperature, especially the turbine temperature since less air is available for cooling. It also increases specific fuel consumption and the EGT and the power output (or thrust) will be decreased, in other words, aircraft, and more precisely engine performance will greatly be decreased. Because of all this, it is normal to see PACKS OFF take-off, since all the available power is needed during this critical stage of the flight.

In this system, air is diverted “bled” from one of the later stages of the compressor section of the engine and piped through ducts to the leading edges of the aerofoil to be protected. Engine inlets can also be protected with hot bleed air, or can be electrically heated.",

This fluid runs back over the surface, forming a thin liquid film that prevents structural ice from forming.

            "explanation": "SMITHS ICE DETECTOR The Smiths ice detector (also known as a differential pressure ice accretion detector) consists of a hollow tube which contains a series of small holes and one large hole positioned in its leading edge and a separate series in its trailing edge. The detector monitors pressure differential between the two edges. In flight under normal conditions, the holes remain open and, consequently, the pressure differential is zero. In icing conditions, holes in the leading edge rapidly become blocked by ice. This causes a change in the pressure differential - a decrease in dynamic pressure is sensed, causing the relay unit to give a warning. A heater element is fitted around the tube to dissipate accumulated ice, which heats up the small holes first causing the indications to turn off.",

Many large and high-performance turbine aircraft use a resistance type electric fuel temperature sender in a main fuel tank for this purpose. Fuel Pressure. Monitoring fuel pressure can give the pilot early warning of a fuel system related malfunction. Verification that the fuel system is delivering fuel to the fuel metering device can be critical. Simple light reciprocating-engine aircraft typically utilize a direct reading Bourdon tube pressure gauge. A more complex aircraft may have a sensor with a transducer located at the fuel inlet to the metering device that sends electrical signals to a cockpit gauge. Fuel Quantity. All aircraft fuel systems must have some form of fuel quantity indicator. These devices vary widely depending on the complexity of the fuel system and the aircraft on which they are installed. Simple direct reading indicators is possible only on light aircraft in which the fuel tanks are in close proximity to the cockpit. Other light aircraft and larger aircraft require electric indicators or electronic capacitance type indicators.",

We need it to have a low freezing point, so the fuel does not freeze in the tanks when at cruising level with a very low outside air temperature. We also prefer it to have a flash point high enough that the fuel will not be able to burn on the ground, whilst refuelling etc. Jet A has a freezing point of -40°C Jet A-1 is very similar but with some additives, to make the freezing point -47°C, which is slightly better. Jet B is much rarer, but is used for aircraft that operate in very cold climates, and has a freezing point of -60°C. Jet B has a lower freezing point, but also a lower flash point, meaning that it could set on fire if lit at normal ground temperatures. This is why it is known as a \"wide cut fuel\", and it is not approved for commercial air transport in the EU. Jet A and Jet A-1 have a minimum flash point of 38°C, which means that they are not too likely to be flammable during refuelling, etc.",

In a 4-engine aircraft, the loss of one engine means you now have a little thrust assymetry and 75% of the aircraft's maximum thrust avialable. If at cruising level, this might not be enough to maintain altitude, and a drift-down procedure may be required. Remember that this is a lot less bad than losing one engine out of two. One thing to think about is that the right hand engines are usually fed from the right hand wing tanks, and the left hand engines from the left wing tanks. If an engine fails and the aircraft is not going to land immediately, then it is a good idea to make sure all available fuel pumps are on and open up the crossfeed valve (if available) to make sure that the engines all have access to fuel, and that one tank does not run dry before the others. This also helps to keep the aircraft balanced. None of the other options are really necessary in the situation, and descending would make the engines less fuel efficient (though would allow for higher thrust output).",

Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have wet wings. RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

Jet fuel is kerosene based, and is very similar to diesel fuel in many ways, but lacks the same lubricating effect of motor diesel, so the diesel piston engines are specially modified or developed to remove this issue. In terms of which jet fuels can be used in a diesel aero-engine, please see the above annex for the generic AFM for a Diamond DA-42 which uses diesel based aero-engines. You will note that there are different fuel names and specifications for different world regions, but in Europe and the US, Jet A-1 is by far the most common. Even diesel itself can only be used in the DA42 if certain modifications are in place. The inclusion of AVTUR in the options is a little troubling. Please understand that Jet A-1 is certainly most correct, both theoretically and in reality when flying around Europe, but AVTUR (aviation turbine fuel) is a word that can mean a few different things. It can be an umbrella term for all aviation turbine fuels, but its first use was as a term for JP-1, an early jet fuel developed by the US military, which is not still used today.",

            "explanation": "The HP fuel pump receives fuel from the LP fuel filter, strategically placed to prevent debris from entering the pumps or other system components. These filters are typically installed at the fuel tank outlet. Subsequently, the HP fuel pump elevates the fuel pressure to fulfill the requirements of the engine-driven fuel pump and fuel injectors. Meanwhile, the FUEL CONTROL UNIT (FCU) acts as a precise fuel metering device, regulating fuel flow to the engine. Due to their high precision, it's crucial for the fuel supplied to them to be clean and free of contaminants. Micronic filters, positioned before the FCU, ensure this cleanliness. These fuel filters are positioned upstream of the FCU to safeguard the delicate components within both the HP fuel pump and the FCU. Examples of potential fuel supply configurations include: LP pump ⇒ oil coolers ⇒ fuel filter ⇒ HP pump ⇒ FCU LP pump ⇒ oil cooler ⇒ fuel heater ⇒ fuel filter ⇒ HP pump ⇒ fuel filter ⇒ FCU",

            ],
            "explanation": "1. In a piston engine, the fuel supply must be gravity-fed fuel. - incorrect In piston-engine aircraft, fuel can be supplied to the engine through either gravity-fed or pump-fed systems. Gravity-fed fuel systems are typically found in high-wing aircraft, where the fuel tanks are positioned above the engine. Gravity allows the fuel to flow naturally from the tanks to the engine without the need for fuel pumps. However, many piston-engine aircraft, especially those with low-wing configurations, use fuel pumps because the fuel tanks are located below the engine. In these cases, mechanical or electric fuel pumps are essential to supply fuel to the engine. Therefore, it is not mandatory for piston-engine fuel supplies to be gravity-fed; the fuel supply method depends on the aircraft's design. 2. In gas turbine engines, fuel tanks must be in low wing configuration. - incorrect Gas turbine engine aircraft can have fuel tanks in various configurations, not exclusively in low-wing designs. While many jet aircraft feature low-wing configurations with fuel tanks integrated into the wings, there are numerous exceptions. High-wing aircraft, such as some turboprop and cargo planes (e.g., the C-130 Hercules), also use gas turbine engines and have fuel tanks located in the wings or fuselage. The placement of fuel tanks in gas turbine engine aircraft is determined by factors like aircraft size, purpose, and design requirements—not solely by the engine type. Therefore, it is not a necessity for gas turbine engine fuel tanks to be in a low-wing configuration.",

RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is almost exactly the same as question 218090, but the correct answer is very slightly different. The answer to question 218090 is slightly more correct in our opinion, but this one is also sufficiently correct, in comparison to the other options. The priming system consists of a priming pump that will deliver fuel to the induction manifold. Its whole purpose is to inject additional fuel in the cylinders intake ports to assist the engine start. As this extra fuel now lines the intake ports/inlet manifold to one or more of the cylinders, and is very volatile, it will evaporate into the air flowing into the cylinders, giving the necessary fuel/air mixture to start the engine. The \"inlet manifold\" is the area just before the intake air gets split up to each individual cylinder, so priming this area will prime the fuel to all cylinders, but we consider this to be almost exactly the same meaning as injecting fuel into the intake ports. In the absence of such a system, it is possible (but more likely to cause a fire hazard) to deliver more fuel to the cylinders by pumping the throttle lever which will act on the accelerator pump and deliver more fuel from the carburettor. Unfortunately, this method coats the earlier intake lines with fuel, and may therefore catch fire unintentionally if the excess fuel drips onto hot components, etc. The priming pump may be electrical or manual, and will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the nozzles at the inlet manifold/intake ports. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs. Whilst pumping the throttle can work, it is not really made for \"priming\", more providing extra fuel to the engine once running, and is therefore not preferred. There is no hole in the spark plug for fuel, and please, please don't rotate a propeller with the throttle wide open. If the magnetos are unintentionally on or the engine has a hot spot then a cylinder could fire and cause serious injury.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question isn't very good, and there are two slightly correct answers here (none that we consider fully correct), but we believe that one is more correct than the other. AIRCRAFT FUEL TANKS INTEGRAL TANKS: Integral Tanks are used on all modern large passenger aircraft and, as its name suggests, a tank is formed as an unit within the airframe structure by sealing part of the structure of the wings or fuselage with a fuel resistant two-part sealant. The sealed skin and structural members provide the highest volume of space available with the lowest weight => this is otherwise unused space inside the wings. Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have \"wet wings\". RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accommodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. They are common on light aircraft. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. So out of these options then, both mentioning maintenance are incorrect. Fuel bladder tanks are great for maintenance as they can be removed completely if necessary. Of the other two options, \"easily punctured\" is neither fully correct nor incorrect, as yes, they can be punctured, of course, but they are often made puncture resistant and may even be self-sealing against punctures. The wrinkles are the only potential problem here, and whilst they are relatively unlikely due to the fixing of the bladder to the aircraft structure, badly designed or incorrectly fixed tanks could easily wrinkle, at which point a few precious litres of fuel become unusable by the engines, and this is certainly a problem.",

Fuel flow meters can indeed measure the mass of fuel passing through them per unit of time. Mass flow measurement is often preferred in aviation because it provides more accurate information about the actual amount of fuel being consumed by the aircraft's engines. \"Fuel flow can be measured by using a fuel flow meter, which measures the volume of fuel passing through it per unit of time.\" This statement is correct. While some fuel flow meters may provide volume measurements, they are less common in aviation applications. Volume measurements are less accurate for fuel flow because the density of fuel can vary, particularly with changes in temperature and altitude. Mass flow measurement provides a more consistent and accurate indication of fuel consumption. In light aircraft with reciprocating engines, systems have been designed to measure fuel volume.",

To address the incorrect options: The fuel is not transferred between tanks, fuel balancing will usually be done by feeding an engine from the other side fuel tank to burn more fuel from that side. Unusable fuel being used for engine cooling would be a terrible idea, as the fuel could ignite and cause an engine fire.

The octane rating of AVGAS is denoted by its grade; for instance, AVGAS 100 indicates a fuel with a 100 octane rating. High-performance engines with elevated compression ratios typically require higher octane fuels to operate efficiently and effectively.

Given the statements, we think the question will be laid out in this way, but this is not assured yet. It could also be a choice of which statements are correct (1, 2 and 4, etc.) with different wording for the statements. For a gravity fed fuel system to work, there is no pump needed to get the fuel to the engine from the tanks (booster pumps are often fitted for use during critical phases of flight), so the fuel is pressurised and fed from the tank(s) to the engine by gravity. The fuel must therefore be stored above the carburettor and engine, such as in a high wing aircraft like a Cessna 152. The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options; A fuel gauge is just as required as it would be in any fuel system. In fact, in some gravity fed aircraft, you can actually see the fuel in the tanks, so they act as their own fuel gauges. We're not sure if the examiner is saying that gravity fed aircraft don't need fuel gauges, or they don't need them any more that pump-fed aircraft do. As mentioned above, the engine could still be fuel injected. The fuel would be gravity fed from the tanks to the high pressure pump just before the fuel injectors. We would say that this is not \"true\" gravity feeding, but it seems to still count, particularly as a low pressure pump is not required to get the fuel out of the tanks. They don't need an electric fuel pump to operate (but may have a boost pump fitted for crucial phases of flight).",

This means that the fuel tanks can be located underneath the engines, and that any engine can be fed from any tank, via pressurised crossfeeding. This is particularly useful with multi-engine aircraft which can have engine failures, to allow fuel balancing in that eventuality. Pressure feed fuel systems are the opposite of purely gravity fed fuel systems, where the tank must be sufficiently over the engine to push the fuel through the lines to the engine. Pressure feed systems have a few advantages over gravity fed fuel systems: The aircraft can be more manoeuvrable as the fuel feeding will not stop if the local gravity changes (during harsh manoeuvres). The fuel flow is more consistent due to higher pressure, less chance of vapour lock and also during manoeuvring the fuel flow will not cut out. The fuel tanks can be anywhere in the aircraft and be pumped to engines which can be anywhere, unlike gravity fed systems which have obviously very strict requirements. Fuel can also be cross-fed, etc. to balance tanks. This makes the aircraft design much more flexible. Disadvantages of pressure feed systems include the fact that gravity fed systems are less complex and therefore reduce weight. They are also not reliant on electric or engine driven fuel pumps.",

As yet we are happy with this as the correct answer, but confirmation would be very useful, thank you! The wording of this question is very misleading in our opinion, as without type-specific knowledge, this is very difficult to answer, but we will try and give you the best information we can. Fuel jettisoning systems are required on an aircraft when there is a large difference between the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and the maximum landing weight (MLW). For a B737 for instance, there is a large difference between these two figures, however overweight landings are approved up to the MTOW of the aircraft if necessary, so no fuel jettison system is required, as any issues in flight, the crew can just perform an overweight landing as soon as necessary. On a larger aircraft, however, the maximum landing weight can be 100 tonnes less than the MTOW, so fuel jettison systems are necessary. Fuel jettison systems are obviously an inherent threat, as anything that removes fuel (and therefore airborne time) from the aircraft is at a high risk of a small error having big consequences. This is why there are protections in place. For starters, jettison systems are usually separate systems from those which feed the engines. Checking some aircraft types which have fuel jettisoning, the B777 has separate jettison pumps that go through specific jettison lines to the jettison valves, and the A340 has jettison valves placed on the refuelling/transfer system. This means that there is no single point of failure which causes unwanted jettisoning of fuel, as if the valves became fixed open, the pumps could be switched off, etc. We have been able to attach a replication of the fuel schematic for a 4 engine aircraft above, notice that the two fuel systems (refuelling/transfer/jettison vs the engine feed) are separate. Also, there is a further method of protection in the tanks, and there is usually a standpipe or other mechanical method that prevents fuel being jettisoned below a certain fuel tank level. This means that there is always enough fuel left for approach and landing (likely also a missed approach), even if the fuel jettison system got rid of everything. This protects for multiple system failures and some amount of human error.",

It vapourises because the fuel pressure is too low, and this allows the molecules to very easily break apart into a gas (remember that some types of fuel are very volatile and prone to becoming a gas anyway). This is effectively the same as the fuel \"boiling\", but due to low pressure rather than very high temperature. This is quite similar to how water boils at a much lower temperature at high altitudes, and you'll struggle to get a good cup of tea on top of Mount Everest, as the water never gets hot enough, boiling at around 65ºC. Low pressure reduces boiling points, as the molecules don't want to be together as much. To prevent vapour locking and cavitation, a low-pressure pump is fitted to the feed line and will supply fuel from the tanks at suitable pressure and flow. Under certain circumstances when the engine is very hot, vapor lock can also occur in the injector lines and prevent the fuel from being correctly delivered to the cylinders.",

FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

            "explanation": "Often aircraft will have a CG that changes significantly during flight, mostly due to fuel burn. This has an affect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is oposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually tranferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Conversely, light aircraft gauge quantity by measuring volume (in liters and gallons) through the adjustment of resistance using a float. However, this method is susceptible to maneuvering inaccuracies and cannot adjust for density fluctuations. Further reading: The working principle of a capacitance-type fuel gauging system is based on the variation of the capacitor’s dielectric. The dielectric is the solution found between the two plates of the capacitor, so in our system, they are the fuel and the air. The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. The float-type fuel gauging system consists of a simple mechanical float sitting on the fuel level and linked via a mechanical arm to a gauge indicating the volume. One of the main limitations of the volume indicating systems is that temperature variations will impact the reading of the tanks’ actual fuel quantity. The reading will also be imprecise during maneuvers, accelerations, and turbulence; the reading will only be reliable in straight and level flight.",

The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options, they are just as necessary (or less so) in a gravity fed system as in a fuel pump driven system.

This question poses the scenario of having low fuel in the left tank for some reason, and asks how to deal with this. Of course, as with any imbalance, crossfeed is usually the way forward. It is important to note that crossfeed does not transfer fuel between tanks, but instead allows both engines to be fed from the other tank. By opening the crossfeed valve, either engine can take fuel from either tank, so how do we stop the system from running out of fuel in the left tank? We have to make sure that the pressure of fuel being pumped out of the right tank is significantly higher than the pressure of fuel from the left tank. We do this by turning the Low Pressure AC fuel pumps from the left tank off completely, and leaving the fuel pumps on from the right tank, so the fuel is taken from the right tank as priority. None of this fuel can flow into the left tank due to the non-return valves, so just feeds both engines at once, burning down the amount of fuel in the right tank until the tanks are equal. Note that in the crossfeeding scenario, if the right tank pumps failed, then both engines could be fed from the suction of the HP engine pumps from either tank, without any AC pumps required, it is just less ideal and more prone to problems. Note: do not worry that the cross-feed valve is open in the question figure, it is just a figure to help you see the layout of the fuel system.",

Remark: For completion of list, please see 021.08 01.02 (02). Often aircraft will have a CG that changes significantly during flight, mostly due to fuel burn. This has an effect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is opposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually transferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Some vents allow excess fuel to escape if the tanks have been overfilled or if the fuel has expanded due to heating. All vents provide atmospheric pressure to the fuel tank, so the space inside doesn't form a small vacuum as the fuel is burnt. Any such vacuum effect could cause problems with taking the fuel out of the tank towards the engines. Most vents provide slightly more than atmospheric pressure by pointing forwards and making use of the ram air to put a \"head of pressure\" on the fuel tank, helping the fuel pumps and reducing cavitation.",

It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment.

            "explanation": "In a large aircraft fuel system, there are usually 2 stages of fuel pumps. Just before the engines are the high pressure (HP) pumps which provide the correct pressure to the fuel nozzles. The suction from these pumps can suck fuel straight out of the tanks, through the fuel lines, however, this is usually supplemented by the addition of low pressure (LP) fuel pumps to suck fuel out of the tank and push it into the fuel lines. This pressurises the fuel in the lines, preventing vapour lock and cavitation. Cavitation is where an object moves through a liquid too quickly, and \"tears\" the liquid, creating gas bubbles in the liquid, even when no gas is present. This can reduce the output pressure of the pumps and therefore reduce fuel flow to the engines. It is much harder to do when the liquid is under pressure, so is more likely at high altitude when the air pressure is not pushing down on the liquid as much inside the fuel tanks. As discussed above, cavitation is reduced by pressurising the fuel, in smaller aircraft by using ram air to push down on the fuel in the tank, and in larger aircraft with LP pumps to pressurise the fuel lines. The failure of LP pumps does not stop the engines from receiving fuel, but cavitation and vapour lock (gas bubbles in the fuel lines) can cause fuel interruptions to the engine.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on student feedback, the official question includes an attachment illustrating the conditions mentioned in the question text. However, we have not yet obtained access to this official attachment. Whenever there is an unexpected fuel quantity indication, a message related to fuel in the FMC or engine display, or an imbalance condition arises, it's essential to consider the possibility of a fuel leak. Detecting a fuel leak can be aided by maintaining a fuel log and comparing the actual fuel burn to the planned fuel burn as part of the flight. It's important to note that there is no specific onboard warning for a fuel leak; it must be identified through changes or discrepancies in expected fuel consumption. Before engaging in any crossfeeding operations, it's crucial to ascertain that a fuel leak is not the root cause of the issue, as it could lead to total fuel loss. Pay close attention to parameters such as fuel flow, fuel usage, and total fuel quantity indications before deactivating any pump switches. If there is suspicion of an inflight fuel leak, take the following steps: turn off the fuel pumps for the center wing tank and close the crossfeed valve. Monitor the fuel tank quantity for any unusual drops and be alert to signs of a fuel imbalance, as these indicators can help confirm the presence of an engine fuel leak. Once an engine fuel leak is confirmed, either through visual observation or flight deck indications, it's imperative to shut down the affected engine to halt the leak and preserve the remaining fuel. After shutting down the affected engine, resume normal fuel management procedures. All remaining fuel can be utilized to power the operational engine safely.",

            "explanation": "FUEL SYSTEM The fuel system in the aircraft that you fly has several purposes, including storing fuel and delivering a steady flow of fuel from the tanks to the engine at adequate pressure and temperature (regardless of power settings, the aircraft’s altitude, or attitude) ensuring engine operation. Another function of the fuel system is to ensure fuel balance (even fuel distribution), via a crossfeed system, resulting in optimization of centre of gravity position. FUEL SYSTEM CS 25.951 General (a) Each fuel system must be constructed and arranged to ensure a flow of fuel at a rate and pressure established for proper engine functioning under each likely operating condition, including any manoeuvre for which certification is requested and during which the engine is permitted to be in operation. (b) Each fuel system must be arranged so that any air which is introduced into the system will not result in – (1) Reserved. (2) Flameout. (c) Each fuel system must be capable of sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel initially saturated with water at 26.7°C (80°F) and having 0.20 cm3 (0.75 cc) of free water per liter (US gallon) added and cooled to the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in operation.",

If two identical batteries are connected in parallel the output voltage will remain the same and the capacity expressed in ampere-hours will double. On the other hand, if the batteries are connected in series, the capacity will remain the same, but the output voltage will double.",

FUSES: are a sacrificial device that is destroyed and needs to be replaced or rewired to be functional again when tripped. Therefore they are not resettable.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.09.01.07.06: Explain the risk of fire resulting from excessive heat in a circuit subjected to overcurrent. Circuit overload protections exist for very good reason. If an electrical consumer ever attempts to pull more current that it should be allowed to have, then that should be stopped, by the blowing of a fuse (which has to then be changed) or the popping of a circuit breaker. This serves many reasons. If a consumer tries to pull much more power than usual, then it may be that the consumer has broken somehow, or a short-circuit has occurred somewhere, which is allowing all the electricity an easy path to ground. This will allow a high level of current through that circuit, which could heat up rapidly, and most circuits are not built for that level of heat or current, so could easily start an electrical fire. This may also remove so much of the available current in the system as well, potentially starving the other consumers of power. In this case, the circuit protection has not worked, so the circuit can overcurrent. This is why we have circuit breakers and fuses, so that if too much current passes through our circuit, the fuse would melt, breaking the connection, or, in a circuit breaker, the excess current would cause a solenoid to pop out the breaker, breaking the connection. Circuit breakers may be reset once (after a few seconds to let the circuit cool), but if they pop again, there is a problem with the circuit and they should not be reset again. There are \"slow blow\" fuses and circuit breakers, which take a few seconds of overcurrent to break the connection, for those circuits which are allowed to go over a certain current for a transient time only. Note: This is a very similar question to Q216001, but with different options.",

This is because when current flows through the coil it induces a magnetic field and when its poles are identical to the permanent magnet at that instant of time which is placed inside the motor, the armature rotates. This law is invertible. i.e. when a coil is rotated between two permanent magnets of opposite polarity along the axis which is perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force, current is induced in the coil due to the change in magnetic flux associated with the coil. The starter generator of an aircraft first starts the aeroplane’s engine, functioning as a motor. After the engine has been started, it turns into a generator.",

            "explanation": "In the diagram you can see the most basic type of thermal circuit breaker. Thermal circuit breakers consist of two different types of metals, that are specifically chosen for their expansion rates for a certain temperature. Usually the top metal (shown in red) is copper, and the bottom metal (shown in blue) is iron. As the current exceeds a set maximum, the metals will start to expand due to the excess heat. Now, because of the different expansion rates of the materials, the metal strip will bend and disconnect from the circuit, hence preventing anymore current from flowing. Why is the correct answer “protects the system in the event of a prolonged overcurrent”: The overcurrent needs to be prolonged so that the materials have time to heat up and start expanding. Usually when an overcurrent occurs, the current is so much higher than the maximum current that it takes very little time (under a second) for the circuit breaker to trip. However, low over-currents can take minutes to cause the breaker to trip. The correct answer needs to contain overcurrent because thermal circuit breakers “protect” from overcurrent, they are not designed to trip at a specific surrounding air temperature. Even if a high temperature could trip the circuit breakers!",

There are a few different types of lithium batteries, Lithium ion, Lithium metal and lithium polymer. They all have slightly different characteristics, but share a similar level of danger. They are all susceptible to thermal runaway. This can come about in a few different ways, depending on the battery type. Lithium ion batteries, for instance, are most susceptible to thermal runaway through overcharging/overheating and damage, which can stop the battery controller from working correctly. Some of the batteries are also very susceptible to swelling with age and internal pressure, and internal short circuits can also cause thermal runaway. This makes lithium batteries dangerous goods, and the vast majority of them are \"forbidden\" on aircraft, except for certain amounts in hand luggage and as crew spares, which can be monitored and dealt with in case of a fire. This is important because a lithium fire burns incredibly hot and is almost impossible to put out without specialist equipment. This does mean that the scenario in this question is highly unlikely to occur, but as they are dangerous goods, the crew must be notified via a NOTOC, and of the options given, only the one stating thermal runaway is correct (Although some of the options are not verified so will likely be different in the exam).",

Circuit overload protections exist for very good reason. If an electrical consumer ever attempts to pull more current that it should be allowed to have, then that should be stopped, by the blowing of a fuse (which has to then be changed) or the popping of a circuit breaker. This serves many reasons. If a consumer tries to pull much more power than usual, then it may be that the consumer has broken somehow, or a short-circuit has occurred somewhere, which is allowing all the electricity an easy path to ground. This will allow a high level of current through that circuit, which could heat up rapidly, and most circuits are not built for that level of heat or current, so could easily start an electrical fire. This may also remove so much of the available current in the system as well, potentially starving the other consumers of power. In this case, the circuit protection has not worked, so the circuit can overcurrent. This is why we have circuit breakers and fuses, so that if too much current passes through our circuit, the fuse would melt, breaking the connection, or, in a circuit breaker, the excess current would cause a solenoid to pop out the breaker, breaking the connection. Circuit breakers may be reset once (after a few seconds to let the circuit cool), but if they pop again, there is a problem with the circuit and they should not be reset again. There are \"slow blow\" fuses and circuit breakers, which take a few seconds of overcurrent to break the connection, for those circuits which are allowed to go over a certain current for a transient time only.",

As an IDG is a self contained system, the fault light in the cockpit can tell us of any problems, and sometimes there is a temperature dial that can tell us of an overheat in the lubricating oil, etc., which might require the IDG to be disconnected from the engine gearbox. If a pilot has to manually disconnect the IDG, they must operate the IDG disconnect switch. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When operated, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reconnected by maintenance, after engine shutdown. Many IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers, so that electrical supply is unavailable for the remainder of the flight.",

A fuse is a thermal circuit protection device which protects distribution system cables and components against excessive electrical current when failures occur. Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accommodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. Any failures (such as short circuits) could cause a failure of the circuit and its components, which may even heat up enough to start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. In this case, a small overload of 4 amps, for instance, would not be protected against, and there is an increased risk of electrical fire. As for the other options: It is not completely safe to do. It will not cause the circuit to stop working. A fire will not immediately start, but is just more likely, in case of failure of other components.",

Housing lithium-ion batteries in a vented metal casing can help to prevent them from becoming a fire hazard by reducing the risk of thermal runaway, which is a condition in which the battery temperature increases rapidly, potentially leading to ignition. The vented casing allows for dissipation of heat and venting of any flammable gases that may be generated during thermal runaway. The other options listed are not effective in preventing lithium-ion batteries from becoming a fire hazard. Installing a fuse on the positive pole of the battery does not address the root cause of thermal runaway, and may not provide adequate protection against ignition. Placing a halon fire extinguisher in the compartment with the battery is not a proactive measure to prevent thermal runaway and may not be able to effectively extinguish a fire that has already started. Continuously charging the battery during flight also does not prevent thermal runaway, and may actually increase the risk of thermal runaway if the battery is overcharged or damaged in some way.",

An alternating current (AC) is passed through one of the wires, what will happen in the other wire. This is a question about magnetic fields and the motor effect. When a current is passed through a wire, it creates a circular magnetic field going around that wire, which affects any free electrons in the vicinity, movement of electrons (current) is directly linked to magnetic fields. The other wire nearby will feel this magnetic field and electrons will begin to move because of it, creating a current. It is not the physical presence of the magnetic field which causes the EMF (electromotive force) that creates the current though, it is the change in magnetic field. There are magnetic fields present all around us (notable that of the Earth which makes our compasses work), but these do not create electricity, unless they change. The question mentions an alternating current, which means that the current goes forwards and backwards in the wire, changing a few times per second (50 times per second is normal for mains power supply - depending on the country), this means that the magnetic field around the first wire is continuously created and destroyed, then created and destroyed in the opposite direction, then back to the first direction, etc. This creates a similar backwards, forwards, backwards, forwards current in the second wire, which is again called alternating current (AC)! This effect can be used to create movement in motors (by creating opposing magnetic fields) and to generate/transfer electricity, but remember, energy cannot come from nowhere, so there must be an opposite effect (called back EMF) somewhere in the system. Note: This came from feedback in RNAV a while ago, but it is certainly an AGK-electrics question, so any feedback about whether this question is still active, etc. would be very useful, thank you.",

The main function of this system is to maintain a constant frequency, sometimes referred as speed. In other words, it is a hydromechanical unit that turns the physical motion of oil/fluid into an AC or DC current. The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swash plate. The angle of the swash plate will either limit or increase the oil flow towards the hydraulic and in turn affect the rpm of the engine. The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turned is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator. The CSD can be disconnected from the engine drive shaft at any time during flight. However, only the engineers can reconnect the CSD, on the ground, with the engines off.",

Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accomodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. It could cause a failure of the device burn it up, start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a severe risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. If the circuit does encounter an overload condition then that part of the circuit that the fuse protects may become a fire hazard. Note: Some students have confirmed that the option \"Overcurrent might go undetected and cause a fire.\" was correct in their exams and confirmed that the option \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" was not within the available answers. However, we have also received a couple of feedback confirming the correct option to be \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" which makes us believe that there are at least two similar question.",

Both real and reactive loads must be matched to ensure correct load sharing between AC generators operating in parallel. When they are connected in parallel, the reactive loads are balanced by regulating the energizing current (exciter field current). On the other side, real load sharing is achieved by increasing the torque input to the lower speed alternator and vice versa. Real Loads – actual working load directly related to the mechanical power (torque) supplied to the alternator (the engine or the CSDU). It is called “real” because it is dependent on the torque at its output shaft available for supplying aircraft’s electrical equipment. Reactive Loads – vector sum of inductive and capacitive currents and voltages (in KVAR).",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOR gate – OR gate + NOT = inverted \"OR\" output, symbolized again by the small circle at the output of the OR gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOT gate – invert gate, used to reverse the state of the input. If input = 0, then output = 1.",

Both synchronising busses can be tied together using the SSB (split-system breaker) if required to balance a load with a generator failure.

The GCU control and protection functions are mainly performed by internal relays: The Generator Control Relay (GCR) controls the excitation of the generator, equivalent to what is called in this question as to the exciter control relay.

When the generator is running, the voltage regulator will send a DC field current to the excitor stator to supplement the magnetic field of the permanent magnets, and allow the generator's output to be controlled. The AC produced in the exciter armature will be converted into DC for the main rotor field supply in order to keep the polarity in the spinning rotor. This allows the motor to run without the need for brushes, thereby increasing lifespan. It also has a higher power to weight ratio than older methods of AC generation. There is a further addition that can be made to this system, where a third smaller generator exists on the same shaft, which has a set of spinning permanent magnets and a stationary armature. The current from the armature is rectified to provide power to the generator control systems, and to the stationary field coils of the excitation generator, and effectively takes the permanent magnets from the older style brushless AC generator, and puts them in a different place (a small thrid generator), serving a similar purpose. This can improve efficiency, and these more modern types of AC generators are also called Permanent Magnet Generators. Whichever type of AC generator that is being asked about, they both use permanent magnets for their intial excitation.",

Sources of magnetic disturbance vary and can include radio frequency transmissions, power lines, and other electrical equipment Magnetic induction describes the process whereby a magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor that either moves relative to the magnetic field or experiences a changing magnetic field passing through it.

            "explanation": "An AC generator driven by a constant speed unit is also known as a Constant Speed Generator Drive System, CSDU, or CSD. The main function of this system is to maintain a constant frequency, sometimes referred to as speed. In other words, it is a hydromechanical unit that turns the physical motion of oil/fluid into an AC or DC current. The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swashplate. The angle of the swash plate will either limit or increase the oil flow towards the hydraulic and in turn affect the rpm of the engine. The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turn is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator. The CSD can be disconnected from the engine drive shaft at any time during the flight. However, only the engineers can reconnect the CSD, on the ground, with the engines off.",

Please try to remember which one you see in the exam so you can let us know in the comments if possible, thank you! Relays are widely used in aircraft electrical systems. They function as switches that use a small DC electrical current to open and close circuits carrying much larger currents (AC or DC), crucial for high-current systems operated by the crew. A small wire coil wound around a ferromagnetic core forms an electromagnet. When activated by a modest current, the electromagnet closes a switch with a hinged metallic arm that it pulls shut. When the current is switched off, the magnetic field disappears, and a spring forces the switch contacts to open. We are therefore using a very safe smaller circuit as a switch so we don't have to go anywhere near high current AC circuits, allowing them to be kept away from the flight deck, etc. The relay is physically separated (air gap/insulation) from the main circuit as otherwise the high current of the main circuit would fry the low rated relay circuit 2) The relay is not physically connected to the circuit. - Correct As mentioned above. 3) The control can be fed with DC and the high current circuit can be fed with AC. - Correct The relay’s contacts are isolated from the control coil, enabling them to handle different types of currents. DC is required for the relay (control circuit) as it needs to keep the electromagnet on at a specific strength. AC or DC can be used by the main circuit, but AC is more common.",

There are 2 equations that will tell us what we need to know here, the first is: 1. Power = Voltage x Current In essence, the energy used per electron (voltage) x the amount of electrons passing per second (current) = the energy used per second (power). 2. Power = Torque x RPM All we need from this equation is to know that power and torque (turning force) are directly proportional (RPM is not mentioned in this question, so it can be assumed to stay the same) Then a simple knowledge of how motors work, a current moving across (perpendicular to) an electric field creates force (torque): The stronger the current, or the stronger the electric field, the more the force (torque). Therefore, the torque is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. (There is an equation for this, Force = Field Strength x Current, but it is easier to just think it out than to remember the formula). Now to check each statement: 1) Mechanical torque is proportional to the voltage x current and is inversely proportional to the strength of the generated field. The first part is correct, Voltage x Current = Power, which is directly proportional to torque. The second part is incorrect, torque is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. 2) Mechanical torque is proportional to the voltage divided by the current and is proportional to the strength of the generated magnetic field. This is the exact opposite to the first one, and therefore the first part is incorrect; voltage divided by current will not be proportional to torque, but the second part is correct. Neither statement is completely correct, so both are incorrect. Note: E is used as the notation for voltage due to a thing called EMF, or electromotive force, and is the way voltage is referred to in motors. I is the standard notation for current.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.09.05.02.03: Explain the consequences of the following: rotor seizure; rotor runaway. An easy way to think about these questions is by thinking that the motor is always trying to correct for the change. Rotor seizes, current and torque increase to try and get it going faster; Rotor runaway, current and torque decrease to try and slow down. Torque is directly set by the current, so they always move in the same direction. Try to remember the diagram, that both the field coils and the armature coils are in series, so the current changes the same way in both of them at the same time. You are supposed to know a little bit more than just this, but that should be enough for the current questions we know about. Longer explanation A series wound DC electric motor is intended to have a certain torque demands put on it. A \"runaway\" is where that torque demand disappears, and all of a sudden, the armature will be spinning freely. This will initially speed the armature up, as there is no longer much resistance to spinning. This increase in speed will lead to an increase in back EMF, which is effectively the \"equal and opposite force\" on a motor, that restricts the current flow. An increase in back EMF will mean that the current flow decreases (more restriction on current flow) through both the field coil and the armature coil, which will subsequently decrease the torque in the motor. Due to the rapidly increasing speed of the motor under no load, the reduction in torque is often not at a fast enough rate to stop an overspeed, and even destruction of the motor. This depends on what safety breakers/cut-offs are involved of course.",

An integrated drive generator (IDG) consists of a Constant Speed Drive (CSD) unit and an electrical generator which are located inside one casing. As an IDG is a self contained system, the fault light in the cockpit can tell us of any problems, and sometimes there is a temperature dial that can tell us of an overheat in the lubricating oil, etc., which might require the IDG to be disconnected from the engine gearbox. If a pilot has to manually disconnect the IDG, they must operate the IDG disconnect switch. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When operated, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reconnected by maintenance, after engine shutdown. IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers, so that electrical supply is unavailable for the remainder of the flight.",

Circuit breakers are special because even after the circuit breaker has blown, the circuit can be closed again, thus allowing to restore the circuit and potentially power important systems. We say that the circuit breaker is resettable The most common circuit breakers are the bimetallic and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too important, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch tripping the circuit breaker and break the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up there should be another solution that will be more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is correcting. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker and trip it immediately.",

This protects us aswell, as it stops current flowing through us (an electric shock) when handling wires, as we do not touch the wires directly, only the outer coating. Protecting wires is done in a similar way, but this time it is to stop any corrosion or physical damage to the internal wiring, for instance when your phone charging cable breaks at the ends due to the constant bending, leavng the wire exposed. This can be stopped by using heavier protection around the wires.",

The main advantages of AC systems over DC systems are the following: Brushless, so require les maintenance and less costs. More responsive to various operations. Lighter than DC generators. Better power to weight ratio. Voltage can be easily changed with transformers. Easy to convert AC into DC. Lower voltage produced at a lower RPM than dynamos.",
