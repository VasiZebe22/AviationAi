# Fix: Chat History Disappearing After AI Response

## Problem
When starting a new chat:
1. Chat would initially appear in history with "No Date available"
2. After AI responded, chat would disappear from history
3. Only visible again after page refresh

## Root Cause
State management issues in three areas:
1. `SET_HISTORY` action wasn't updating `savedChats`
2. `handleSubmit` was making redundant state updates
3. Chat list wasn't getting the latest message data

## Solution
1. Enhanced `SET_HISTORY` in useChatReducer.js to:
   - Update currentChat with messages and timestamp
   - Synchronize savedChats with latest messages
2. Simplified handleSubmit to use single state update
3. Ensured all state stays consistent

## Key Changes
```javascript
// In useChatReducer.js
case SET_HISTORY:
  return {
    ...state,
    history: action.payload,
    currentChat: state.currentChat ? {
      ...state.currentChat,
      messages: action.payload,
      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
    } : null,
    savedChats: state.currentChat?.id ? 
      state.savedChats.map(chat => 
        chat.id === state.currentChat.id
          ? {
              ...chat,
              messages: action.payload,
              lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
            }
          : chat
      )
      : state.savedChats
  };

// In useMessageHandling.js
// Replaced multiple state updates with:
dispatch({ 
  type: actions.SET_HISTORY, 
  payload: finalHistory 
});
```

## Verification Steps
1. Start new chat - appears immediately in history
2. Send message - chat remains visible while waiting
3. Receive AI response - chat stays visible with updated timestamp
4. No refresh needed - state stays consistent
