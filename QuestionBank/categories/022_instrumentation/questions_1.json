The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "Step 1: Find the direction of the turn – clockwise or anticlockwise? The aircraft turns to the left onto a northerly heading => anticlockwise. Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card.

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized.

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

This is also often known as a flux valve or a flux detector. - Heading Indicator. - Precession Amplifier. - Precession Motor. - Horizontal Gyro. The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000° M or 360° M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North.

If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction.

Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

You’re currently maintaining a compass heading of 242°, therefore you look for this value in the lower line of the deviation table. The value above 242°, in the ‘to fly’ line is 240°. This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted.

A compass is marked in degrees from 000 to 359 in a clockwise direction starting from North. Therefore, regardless of your heading, any turn to the left will result in a decrease in your heading in degrees. For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading. From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 004° 001°W 003° 5°W 358°",

This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator.

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

            "explanation": "Synchronous motors consist of a stator and a rotor. The stator's field coil is excited by a 3-phase alternate current, and the rotor is a basic permanent magnet. The rotor poles will attract the opposite poles of the stator’s rotating magnetic field and will rotate at the same speed, or in other words, at synchronous speed. If the rotor has no initial rotation force, the opposite poles’ attraction force won’t be enough to rotate the rotor and self-start the motor. In this case, a ‘squirrel cage’ will be fitted to the rotor so that it can be rotated by the electromagnetic field of the stator (supplied by 3 phase AC). When the rotor reaches its maximum speed, it will get energized and synchronized with the stator’s opposite poles to rotate at a synchronous speed. However, until the rotor becomes synchronized with the stator’s opposite poles, the squirrel cage is asynchronous. It is basically an inductive system since electricity is introduced to the rotor by magnetic induction rather than direct electric supply, and inductive systems are asynchronous by their operating principle as described above. It is believed that in this question, the examiner wants to highlight that the squirrel cage is asynchronous and the motor itself has a synchronous operation. A permanent magnet is linked through a shaft to the rotor of the synchronous motor and is rotating in an aluminum drag cup. Eddy currents with their own magnetic field are generated by the rotating magnet and act on the electrons of the drag cup. The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force that will turn the drag cup in the permanent magnet's direction. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The frequency of the AC supplied to the synchronous motor is proportional to the engine’s RPM. Therefore, the higher the RPM, the higher the current supplied to the motor and also the torque resulting from the magnet rotating inside the drag-cup. The hairspring opposes the turning force to control the indication of the pointer.",

You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction. Synchroscopes may have different operating principles; some may work based on a supplied voltage; others may compare each engine's alternators' frequencies. Modern propeller-driven multiengine airplanes have their engine RPMs automatically synchronized through various control units.",

In aviation, the mass of the fuel is a critical factor for flight planning and safety. Pounds (lb): Pounds also measure mass and are commonly used in countries that follow the imperial system, such as the United States. Just like kilograms, knowing the fuel's mass in pounds is essential for accurate flight operations and performance calculations.

The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to a RPM value by comparing the deduced frequency of alternators driven by engines/propellers. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine => the frequencies of the \"slaves\" are compared with the frequency of the \"master\" engine. These differences in frequency will create torque which, consequently, acts on the synchroscope indicator needle.",

The rotor of the motor drives a permanent magnet rotating inside an aluminum or copper alloy drag cup. Eddy currents with their own magnetic field are generated by the rotating magnet and act on the electrons of the drag cup. The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force that will turn the drag cup in the permanent magnet's direction. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The frequency of the AC supplied to the synchronous motor is proportional to the engine’s RPM. Therefore, the higher the RPM, the higher the current supplied to the motor and also the torque resulting from the magnet rotating inside the drag-cup. The hairspring opposes the turning force to control the indication of the pointer.",

            "explanation": "A jet engine is different from a conventional piston engine, as thrust is the direct force output from the engines and is roughly proportional to the fuel flow. On modern commercial jets, the primary source of information regarding the engine’s power is the N1 and the EPR. The N1, displayed to the pilots as a percentage, is nothing else than the compressor’s first stage (the fan) rotation speed. In a modern gas turbine engine such as the CFM 56 fitted to the B737 or A320, the engine has two compressor turbine assemblies. Each assembly is mounted on a common shaft. The first one is a Low Pressure compressor turbine assembly, and the second one is the High Pressure compressor turbine assembly. The first part of the engine is the fan, which divides the incoming airflow into two streams. The first stream is directed to the next compressor stages for further compression and combustion. The rest of the airflow is accelerated around the core, providing most of the engine thrust. Be careful! The wording of the question is very misleading. You need to remember what a compressor stage is. One stage in a compressor consists of a rotating disk of rotor blades followed by the stator's stationary blades. Usually, manufacturers refer to the first stage of the LP compressor as the bypass fan (see the attached picture of the PW-1000 G engine). We agree that both ‘first stage compressor speed’ and ‘low pressure shaft speed’ are correct answers as the fan is technically the first stage of the LP compressor. However, the examiner most probably wants to point-out the difference between the fan and the next stages of the LP compressor as it has a slightly different function than the rest of the LP compressor stages (division of the airflow into two different streams). Therefore, the whole scope of the provided correct answer is to stress that the N1 is defined as the fan’s speed. Note: This is the correct answer indicated by EASA at the official instrumentation exam according to other students’ feedback. Please, don’t hesitate to send us your feedback if you get this question at your official exam so that we can update the wording and/or edit the explanation accordingly.",

The ration is determined by dividing the pressure at the exhaust nozzle (turbine outlet pressure) by the pressure at the compressor entry. Both these pressures are measured by pitot tubes. Consequently, should any of these sensors fail or the signal cannot be transferred, the indicated EPR will be different than the actual EPR. During take-off, the aircraft accelerates and the engine intake pressure will increase due to the increased forward speed. When at some point the pressure sensor on the compressor inlet becomes blocked, it cannot sense the higher intake pressure, but continues to report the low pressure at the time of blockage. The outlet pressure increases, and the sensor which is unaffected by the blockage can measure that. The turbine outlet pressure is divided by a too low compressor inlet pressure, and the result is higher than the actual EPR.",

The electrical tachometer is basically a 3 phase AC tacho-generator driven by the engine. It is usually situated in the gearbox, close to the engine-driven generator. The current fed by the generator is fed to the indicator consisting of a synchronous motor driving a magnet-drag cup assembly that moves a pointer over a scale. The electronic tachometer is a simpler system requiring less wiring and can be fitted on any of the engine’s rotating parts. It consists of a small electromagnet probe (inductive probe) that detects the passage of a notched wheel mounted on the compressor or turbine shaft. When the notched wheel passes in front of the probe, it alters its magnetic field. The frequency at which the magnetic field of the probe is altered is directly related to the rotation speed of the compressor. The mechanical tachometer works on the same drag cup assembly principle as its successor, the tacho-generator. A shaft directly connected to the engine drives a permanent magnet in a drag cup. The main disadvantage of this system is that the shaft connecting the engine and the permanent magnet cannot be too long, usually only about 2m. Therefore, it cannot be fitted on aircraft other than light airplanes where the engine is close to the cockpit.",

It is measured in Joules, and 1 Joule = 1 Nm (same unit as torque). The Rotations Per Minute (rpm) define an angular motion over time. Therefore, the product of work generated by a body (Nm) in angular motion over time gives you the power produced by that body. Try to remember the correct formula by using the units of each variable. P = T x n → n = P / T Where: T – torque in Nm N – rotations per minute (1/min) P – Power in Watt (W) Since 1 W = 1 Nm/s, a small conversion needs to be made from rpm (1/min) to rps (1/sec) by using: rpm ÷ 60 = rps",

                "The critical engine is the engine which would give the biggest yawing moment if it fails"
            ],
            "explanation": "When an engine fails on a multi-engine aircraft, there will be a decrease in thrust and an increase in drag on the side of the failed engine. Primarily there will be a yawing moment towards the failed (dead) engine. The critical engine is the engine which would give the biggest yawing moment if it fails. One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following an engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (i.e., distance from the aircraft's CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). In case of a propeller engine aircraft, the length of the thrust arm is determined by the asymmetric effect of the propeller. When the aircraft is flying with a positive angle of attack (which is normal), the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller (when viewed from the rear) is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade (P-factor). If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a larger yawing moment. If both engines rotate inward, they will have the same (shorter) thrust arm (counter-rotating propellers). Of course, no matter the direction of the propellers, a failure of the left engine will always produce a yaw to the left, it is just bigger if the aircraft has clockwise rotation propellers. Note: Although this question is not part of the instrumentation syllabus, it was added to the database because of student feedback. If you find this question in your INSTRUMENTATION exam, you should appeal.",

Modern propeller-driven multiengine airplanes have their engine RPMs automatically synchronized through various control units. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial using a pointer the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction.",

One of the main limitations of the volume indicating systems is that temperature variations will impact the reading of the tanks’ actual fuel quantity. In fact, at warm temperatures, fuel is heated up and expands. Since the volume of fuel is increasing, the float-type gauge indicates an increase of fuel quantity within the tanks. The reading will also be imprecise during maneuvers (pitch angle changes), accelerations, and turbulence; the reading will only be reliable in straight and level flight. To overcome this problem, modern capacitor-type fuel gauging systems are fitted with a density compensating unit, which accounts for the temperature changes by converting the output from volume to mass of fuel.",

Consequently, should any of these sensors fail or the signal cannot be transferred, the indicated EPR will be different than the actual EPR. During take-off, the aircraft accelerates and the engine intake pressure will increase due to the increased forward speed. When at some point the pressure sensor on the compressor inlet becomes blocked, it cannot sense the higher intake pressure, but continues to report the low pressure at the time of blockage. The outlet pressure increases, and the sensor which is unaffected by the blockage can measure that. The turbine outlet pressure is divided by a too low compressor inlet pressure, and the result is higher than the actual EPR. During take-off, depending on the engine manufacturer, both EPR or N1 can be used for thrust setting. If EPR becomes invalid, it may be possible to continue with N1 readings.",

On modern commercial jets, the primary source of information regarding the engine’s power is the N1 and the EPR. The N1, displayed to the pilots as a percentage, is nothing else than the compressor’s first stage (the fan) rotation speed. In a modern gas turbine engine such as the CFM 56 fitted to the B737 or A320, the engine has two compressor turbine assemblies. Each assembly is mounted on a common shaft. The first one is a Low-Pressure compressor turbine assembly, and the second one is a High-Pressure compressor turbine assembly. The first part of the engine is the fan, which divides the incoming airflow into two streams. The first stream is directed to the next compressor stages for further compression and combustion. The rest of the airflow is accelerated around the core, providing most of the engine thrust.",

Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction. Synchroscopes may have different operating principles; some may work based on a supplied voltage; others may compare each engine's alternators' frequencies.

The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to a RPM value. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. \"Synchronize engine/propeller speed and synchronize fuel consumption\" Incorrect.

The other end of the tube is connected through a mechanical linkage and gears to a pointer. As fluid flows and pressure build-up, the tube will tend to unroll and move the mechanical linkage. The pressure ranges for a Bourdon tube can be vast as its movement is dependent on the metal from which it is made. For instance, a stiffer metal will be fitted for higher pressures. A bi-metal temperature compensator is also fitted at the end of the ‘C’ tube to correct for the temperature of flowing fluid, which will alter the tube’s stiffness and efficiency. Typical applications for Bourdon tubes in aircraft are fuel and engine oil pressure measurement and fluid pressure measurement in the hydraulic system.",

Although the values are not corresponding exactly, we know that 15 psi = 1000 hPa, which is very close to 1013.25 hPa. Therefore, we can deduce that 14.5 psi or 29.92 in Hg is the correct answer.

            "explanation": "The electrical-type quantity gauge consists of an indicator in the cockpit and a float operated transmitter installed in the tank. The transmitter sends a different level of signal to the cockpit, dependent on the height of the float in the tank, and the signal then feeds the indicator. This type of systems are simple and cheap to manufacture and some systems can be isolated from changing voltages in the aircraft electrical system. Other advantages of this fuel quantity gauge include: an indicator which can be located any distance from the tank; and the fuel levels of several tanks can be read on one indicator. The disadvantage of float type fuel gauges is that they are always subject to variations in temperature, measuring volume, not mass of fuel. The two primary ways of making an electric type float gauge are with a ratiometer and a wheatstone bridge (galvanometer). The ratiometer works as seen in the first figure above. The DC power is sent equally through two circuits, one circuit with a fixed resistor, and the other with a variable resistor connected to the float in the tank. Each circuit has a coil of wire on it to produce a magnetic field, and the magnetised needle sits between, pointing to a position on the dial dependent on the relative strength of the magnetic fields, which will change based on the resistance of the variable resistor (and therefore the height of the float gauge). This indication does not vary with changes in system voltage, as it is measuring relative magnetic fields from the same source (useful as aircraft system voltages vary). The wheatstone bridge (galvanometer) system, seen in the second figure above, instead measures the resistance of the same variable resistor (connected to the float) by splitting the current of the circuit between two paths, one path having 2 fixed resistors, and the other path having a fixed resistor and the variable resistor. The variable resistor then changes how the resistance is split amongst that circuit, and current will want to flow through the galvanometer in the middle either one way or the other (and by a certain amount). A galvanometer is a very precise ammeter for our purposes. This indication does vary with changes in system voltage in a linear sense (higher voltage = higher indication), so is less useful than the ratiometer.",

The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to an RPM value. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master and it drives an alternator feeding a rotor. And the other engines are the slaves and drive their own-side alternator that is feeding a stator. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine => the frequencies of the \"slaves\" are compared with the frequency of the \"master\" engine. These differences in frequency will create torque which, consequently, acts on the synchroscope indicator needle.",

This rate is sensed by an electrical pick-off that transmits the signal to an indicator in the flight deck. In the gravimetric type transmitter, the fuel flow is measured by a vane restrained by a calibrated spring, which deflects at a certain angle proportional to the mass flow. The gravimetric transmitter is compensated for density variations with temperature, by a bleed outlet. As you can imagine, the indicator of the mass flowmeter displays a mass flow straight away.

Therefore, the product of work generated by a body (Nm) in angular motion over time gives you the power produced by that body. Try to remember the correct formula by using the units of each variable.

It works on the same drag cup assembly principle as its successor, the tacho-generator. A shaft directly connected to the engine drives a permanent magnet in a drag cup. Eddy currents with their own magnetic field are generated by the rotating magnet and act on the electrons of the drag cup. The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force proportional to the rotational speed of the magnet. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The main disadvantage of this system is that the shaft connecting the engine and the permanent magnet cannot be too long, usually only about 2m. Therefore, it cannot be fitted on aircraft other than light airplanes where the engine is close to the cockpit.",

It consists of a ‘C’ shaped tube where the fluid enters through a damping choke. The other end of the tube is connected through a mechanical linkage and gears to a pointer. As fluid flows and pressure build-up, the tube will tend to unroll and move the mechanical linkage. The pressure ranges for a Bourdon tube can be vast as its movement is dependent on the metal from which it is made. For instance, a stiffer metal will be fitted for higher pressures. A bi-metal temperature compensator is also fitted at the end of the ‘C’ tube to correct for the temperature of flowing fluid, which will alter the tube’s stiffness and efficiency.",

This voltage is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions. By measuring this voltage, one can determine the temperature at the hot junction. The fundamental principle of thermocouples lies in the thermoelectric effect, which generates a voltage across the two junctions when a temperature difference exists between them. Thus, the correct answer is \"A thermocouple generates a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between its two junctions.\" When one junction of two ‘dissimilar’ metals is heated a voltage proportional to the temperature between the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ junctions occurs, and current flows in the circuit. Two commonly used metals are Copper-Constantan and Iron-Constantan, which are both able to withstand high temperatures and produce a useable voltage. To measure high temperatures up to 1000°F and above a combination of Chromel-Alumel is used. Thermocouples are used on piston engines to measure the cylinder head temperature. These systemes are also used to operate exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauges on jet engines.",

On modern commercial jets, the primary source of information regarding the engine’s power is the N1 and the EPR. The N1, displayed to the pilots as a percentage, is nothing else than the compressor’s first stage rotation speed. The EPR is the ratio between the low-pressure turbine exhaust pressure (the engine’s last stage) and the engine inlet pressure (the fan’s pressure). The EGT is the temperature measured at the outlet of the turbine. It is measured by dozens of thermocouples with the hot junction mounted all around the turbine’s exhaust. The EGT is measured to monitor the engine performance and its degradation over time. When flying, if you notice that the EGT of one engine is slightly higher than the other’s one, it probably means the engine with the higher EGT is the oldest one. The N2 is the speed of the High-pressure compressor/turbine assembly. In modern commercial aircraft, this indicator is particularly useful during the engine start sequence when monitoring the start motor acceleration, the start of the fuel flow, etc.",

In a capacitance system, the insulating material between the two plates is called dielectric. In this case, the dielectric is a mixing of fuel and air. In simple terms, the dielectric permittivity represents the ability of electrical charges to propagate through the dielectric. Fuel has approximately twice the capacitance of the air, but it will change as density changes. This will also influence the dielectric permittivity as a decrease in density will cause a decrease in the dielectric permittivity.",

A liter of warm fuel will produce less energy than a liter of cold fuel because of the difference in density. Whereas a kilogram of fuel will produce the same energy whatever the temperature. All the aircraft manuals specify the endurance and fuel consumption in kg/h.

            "explanation": "Synchronous motors consist of a stator and a rotor. The stator's field coil is excited by a 3-phase alternate current, and the rotor is a basic permanent magnet. The rotor poles will attract the opposite poles of the stator’s rotating magnetic field and will rotate at the same speed, or in other words, at synchronous speed. If the rotor has no initial rotation force, the opposite poles’ attraction force won’t be enough to rotate the rotor and self-start the motor. In this case, a ‘squirrel cage’ will be fitted to the rotor so that it can be rotated by the electromagnetic field of the stator (supplied by 3 phase AC). When the rotor reaches its maximum speed, it will get energized and synchronized with the stator’s opposite poles to rotate at a synchronous speed. However, until the rotor becomes synchronized with the stator’s opposite poles, the squirrel cage is asynchronous. It is basically an inductive system since electricity is introduced to the rotor by magnetic induction rather than direct electric supply, and inductive systems are asynchronous by their operating principle as described above. It is believed that in this question, the examiner wants to highlight that the squirrel cage is asynchronous and the motor itself has a synchronous operation. A permanent magnet is linked through a shaft to the rotor of the synchronous motor and is rotating in an aluminum drag cup. Eddy currents with their own magnetic field are generated by the rotating magnet and act on the electrons of the drag cup. The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force that will turn the drag cup in the permanent magnet's direction. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The frequency of the AC supplied to the synchronous motor is proportional to the engine’s RPM. Therefore, the higher the RPM, the higher the current supplied to the motor and also the torque resulting from the magnet rotating inside the drag-cup. The hairspring opposes the turning force to control the indication of the pointer.",

You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction. Synchroscopes may have different operating principles; some may work based on a supplied voltage; others may compare each engine's alternators' frequencies. Modern propeller-driven multiengine airplanes have their engine RPMs automatically synchronized through various control units.",

Kilograms (Kg): Kilograms measure mass and are crucial because the weight of the fuel directly affects the aircraft's weight and balance. In aviation, the mass of the fuel is a critical factor for flight planning and safety. Pounds (lb): Pounds also measure mass and are commonly used in countries that follow the imperial system, such as the United States. Just like kilograms, knowing the fuel's mass in pounds is essential for accurate flight operations and performance calculations.

The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to a RPM value by comparing the deduced frequency of alternators driven by engines/propellers. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine => the frequencies of the \"slaves\" are compared with the frequency of the \"master\" engine. These differences in frequency will create torque which, consequently, acts on the synchroscope indicator needle.",

The three-phase AC is supplied by the engine-driven generator and is connected directly to the synchronous motor. The rotor of the motor drives a permanent magnet rotating inside an aluminum or copper alloy drag cup. Eddy currents with their own magnetic field are generated by the rotating magnet and act on the electrons of the drag cup. The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force that will turn the drag cup in the permanent magnet's direction. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The frequency of the AC supplied to the synchronous motor is proportional to the engine’s RPM. Therefore, the higher the RPM, the higher the current supplied to the motor and also the torque resulting from the magnet rotating inside the drag-cup. The hairspring opposes the turning force to control the indication of the pointer.",

            "explanation": "A jet engine is different from a conventional piston engine, as thrust is the direct force output from the engines and is roughly proportional to the fuel flow. On modern commercial jets, the primary source of information regarding the engine’s power is the N1 and the EPR. The N1, displayed to the pilots as a percentage, is nothing else than the compressor’s first stage (the fan) rotation speed. In a modern gas turbine engine such as the CFM 56 fitted to the B737 or A320, the engine has two compressor turbine assemblies. Each assembly is mounted on a common shaft. The first one is a Low Pressure compressor turbine assembly, and the second one is the High Pressure compressor turbine assembly. The first part of the engine is the fan, which divides the incoming airflow into two streams. The first stream is directed to the next compressor stages for further compression and combustion. The rest of the airflow is accelerated around the core, providing most of the engine thrust. Be careful! The wording of the question is very misleading. You need to remember what a compressor stage is. One stage in a compressor consists of a rotating disk of rotor blades followed by the stator's stationary blades. Usually, manufacturers refer to the first stage of the LP compressor as the bypass fan (see the attached picture of the PW-1000 G engine). We agree that both ‘first stage compressor speed’ and ‘low pressure shaft speed’ are correct answers as the fan is technically the first stage of the LP compressor. However, the examiner most probably wants to point-out the difference between the fan and the next stages of the LP compressor as it has a slightly different function than the rest of the LP compressor stages (division of the airflow into two different streams). Therefore, the whole scope of the provided correct answer is to stress that the N1 is defined as the fan’s speed. Note: This is the correct answer indicated by EASA at the official instrumentation exam according to other students’ feedback. Please, don’t hesitate to send us your feedback if you get this question at your official exam so that we can update the wording and/or edit the explanation accordingly.",

Consequently, should any of these sensors fail or the signal cannot be transferred, the indicated EPR will be different than the actual EPR. During take-off, the aircraft accelerates and the engine intake pressure will increase due to the increased forward speed. When at some point the pressure sensor on the compressor inlet becomes blocked, it cannot sense the higher intake pressure, but continues to report the low pressure at the time of blockage. The outlet pressure increases, and the sensor which is unaffected by the blockage can measure that.

In contrast to a float system, capacitance type fuel gauges measure fuel mass, which is directly proportional to the contained amount of energy. In case of a malfunction, the capacitance would reduce to zero, causing the fuel gauge to indicate “empty”.",

            "explanation": "There are 3 types of tachometers currently in use: the electrical, electronic, and mechanical tachometer. The electrical tachometer is basically a 3 phase AC tacho-generator driven by the engine. It is usually situated in the gearbox, close to the engine-driven generator. The current fed by the generator is fed to the indicator consisting of a synchronous motor driving a magnet-drag cup assembly that moves a pointer over a scale. The electronic tachometer is a simpler system requiring less wiring and can be fitted on any of the engine’s rotating parts. It consists of a small electromagnet probe (inductive probe) that detects the passage of a notched wheel mounted on the compressor or turbine shaft. When the notched wheel passes in front of the probe, it alters its magnetic field. The frequency at which the magnetic field of the probe is altered is directly related to the rotation speed of the compressor. The mechanical tachometer works on the same drag cup assembly principle as its successor, the tacho-generator. A shaft directly connected to the engine drives a permanent magnet in a drag cup. The main disadvantage of this system is that the shaft connecting the engine and the permanent magnet cannot be too long, usually only about 2m. Therefore, it cannot be fitted on aircraft other than light airplanes where the engine is close to the cockpit.",

            "explanation": "When an engine fails on a multi-engine aircraft, there will be a decrease in thrust and an increase in drag on the side of the failed engine. Primarily there will be a yawing moment towards the failed (dead) engine. The critical engine is the engine which would give the biggest yawing moment if it fails. One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following an engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (i.e., distance from the aircraft's CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). In case of a propeller engine aircraft, the length of the thrust arm is determined by the asymmetric effect of the propeller. When the aircraft is flying with a positive angle of attack (which is normal), the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller (when viewed from the rear) is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade (P-factor). If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a larger yawing moment. If both engines rotate inward, they will have the same (shorter) thrust arm (counter-rotating propellers). Of course, no matter the direction of the propellers, a failure of the left engine will always produce a yaw to the left, it is just bigger if the aircraft has clockwise rotation propellers. Note: Although this question is not part of the instrumentation syllabus, it was added to the database because of student feedback. If you find this question in your INSTRUMENTATION exam, you should appeal.",

Modern propeller-driven multiengine airplanes have their engine RPMs automatically synchronized through various control units. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial using a pointer the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction.",

The dielectric is the solution found between the two plates of the capacitor, so in our system, they are the fuel and the air. The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. As you can imagine, the area of the plates and the distance between is not going to change over time, they’re fixed. So, the only variable is going to be the dielectric.

One of the main limitations of the volume indicating systems is that temperature variations will impact the reading of the tanks’ actual fuel quantity. In fact, at warm temperatures, fuel is heated up and expands. Since the volume of fuel is increasing, the float-type gauge indicates an increase of fuel quantity within the tanks. The reading will also be imprecise during maneuvers (pitch angle changes), accelerations, and turbulence; the reading will only be reliable in straight and level flight. To overcome this problem, modern capacitor-type fuel gauging systems are fitted with a density compensating unit, which accounts for the temperature changes by converting the output from volume to mass of fuel.",

The ration is determined by dividing the pressure at the exhaust nozzle (turbine outlet pressure) by the pressure at the compressor entry. Both these pressures are measured by pitot tubes. Consequently, should any of these sensors fail or the signal cannot be transferred, the indicated EPR will be different than the actual EPR. During take-off, the aircraft accelerates and the engine intake pressure will increase due to the increased forward speed. When at some point the pressure sensor on the compressor inlet becomes blocked, it cannot sense the higher intake pressure, but continues to report the low pressure at the time of blockage. The outlet pressure increases, and the sensor which is unaffected by the blockage can measure that. The turbine outlet pressure is divided by a too low compressor inlet pressure, and the result is higher than the actual EPR. During take-off, depending on the engine manufacturer, both EPR or N1 can be used for thrust setting. If EPR becomes invalid, it may be possible to continue with N1 readings.",

The electronic tachometer is a simpler system requiring less wiring and can be fitted on any of the engine’s rotating parts. It consists of a small electromagnet probe (inductive probe) that detects the passage of a notched wheel mounted on the compressor or turbine shaft.

In simple terms, the dielectric permittivity represents the ability of electrical charges to propagate through the dielectric.

One engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. Generally, the synchroscopes use each engine's tachometers to convert the rotational speed into an electrical current. In this way, if the slave engine is turning faster, it produces a bigger current, and the pointer will turn in a given direction. If the slave engine is rotating slower, the current provided to the synchroscope will be lower, and the pointer will turn in the opposite direction. Synchroscopes may have different operating principles; some may work based on a supplied voltage; others may compare each engine's alternators' frequencies.

The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to a RPM value. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master, and the others are the slaves. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine. \"Synchronize engine/propeller speed and synchronize fuel consumption\" Incorrect. The synchroscope is used to synchronize the engines' RPM, not the fuel.",

The pressure ranges for a Bourdon tube can be vast as its movement is dependent on the metal from which it is made. For instance, a stiffer metal will be fitted for higher pressures. A bi-metal temperature compensator is also fitted at the end of the ‘C’ tube to correct for the temperature of flowing fluid, which will alter the tube’s stiffness and efficiency.

Although the values are not corresponding exactly, we know that 15 psi = 1000 hPa, which is very close to 1013.25 hPa. Therefore, we can deduce that 14.5 psi or 29.92 in Hg is the correct answer.

            "explanation": "The electrical-type quantity gauge consists of an indicator in the cockpit and a float operated transmitter installed in the tank. The transmitter sends a different level of signal to the cockpit, dependent on the height of the float in the tank, and the signal then feeds the indicator. This type of systems are simple and cheap to manufacture and some systems can be isolated from changing voltages in the aircraft electrical system. Other advantages of this fuel quantity gauge include: an indicator which can be located any distance from the tank; and the fuel levels of several tanks can be read on one indicator. The disadvantage of float type fuel gauges is that they are always subject to variations in temperature, measuring volume, not mass of fuel. The two primary ways of making an electric type float gauge are with a ratiometer and a wheatstone bridge (galvanometer). The ratiometer works as seen in the first figure above. The DC power is sent equally through two circuits, one circuit with a fixed resistor, and the other with a variable resistor connected to the float in the tank. Each circuit has a coil of wire on it to produce a magnetic field, and the magnetised needle sits between, pointing to a position on the dial dependent on the relative strength of the magnetic fields, which will change based on the resistance of the variable resistor (and therefore the height of the float gauge). This indication does not vary with changes in system voltage, as it is measuring relative magnetic fields from the same source (useful as aircraft system voltages vary). The wheatstone bridge (galvanometer) system, seen in the second figure above, instead measures the resistance of the same variable resistor (connected to the float) by splitting the current of the circuit between two paths, one path having 2 fixed resistors, and the other path having a fixed resistor and the variable resistor. The variable resistor then changes how the resistance is split amongst that circuit, and current will want to flow through the galvanometer in the middle either one way or the other (and by a certain amount). A galvanometer is a very precise ammeter for our purposes. This indication does vary with changes in system voltage in a linear sense (higher voltage = higher indication), so is less useful than the ratiometer.",

            "explanation": "SYNCHROSCOPE Even a slight difference in RPM can create uncomfortable noise, oscillations and vibrations. The noise can be uncomfortable for the flight/cabin crew and the passengers. You can realize that engine RPMs are not synchronized during the flight if you hear a strange intermittent beat. Continuous exposure to vibrations may also induce early fatigue to the airframe. The RPM indicator only allows the pilot to set the RPM roughly, but discrepancies in engines’ speed can be hard to adjust. To overcome this problem, some aircraft are fitted with an instrument called a synchroscope. The synchroscope is an instrument that indicates whether two or more rotating devices, such as engines, are synchronized and is, therefore, used to synchronize the speeds of engines/propellers to an RPM value. In a synchroscope, one engine is identified as the master and it drives an alternator feeding a rotor. And the other engines are the slaves and drive their own-side alternator that is feeding a stator. The instrument indicates on a dial by means of a pointer, the variation in RPM relative to the master engine => the frequencies of the \"slaves\" are compared with the frequency of the \"master\" engine. These differences in frequency will create torque which, consequently, acts on the synchroscope indicator needle.",

This rate is sensed by an electrical pick-off that transmits the signal to an indicator in the flight deck. In the gravimetric type transmitter, the fuel flow is measured by a vane restrained by a calibrated spring, which deflects at a certain angle proportional to the mass flow. The gravimetric transmitter is compensated for density variations with temperature, by a bleed outlet. As you can imagine, the indicator of the mass flowmeter displays a mass flow straight away. However, the fuel density needs to be manually inserted in the volumetric type system to indicate a mass flow rate.",

Therefore, the product of work generated by a body (Nm) in angular motion over time gives you the power produced by that body. Try to remember the correct formula by using the units of each variable. P = T x n Where: T – torque in Nm N – rotations per minute (1/min) P – Power in Watt (W) Since 1 W = 1 Nm/s, a small conversion needs to be made from rpm (1/min) to rps (1/sec) by using: rpm ÷ 60 = rps",

The latest engines have the facility whereby the vibration level of each rotating assembly is monitored so that the source of the vibration can be pinpointed. The principle upon which VME works requires either an input from a Piezoelectric crystal mounted strategically on the engine, or an input from a coil which will be affected by the movement of a Magnet mounted loosely within it.

The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by the Eddy currents and the magnet's magnetic field produces a turning force proportional to the rotational speed of the magnet. A small shaft connects the drag cup with a hairspring and a pointer calibrated to indicate the RPM on a dial. The main disadvantage of this system is that the shaft connecting the engine and the permanent magnet cannot be too long, usually only about 2m.

            "explanation": "A bourdon tube is a pressure sensing instrument designed for high-pressure systems such as oil pressure measuring. It consists of a ‘C’ shaped tube where the fluid enters through a damping choke. The other end of the tube is connected through a mechanical linkage and gears to a pointer. As fluid flows and pressure build-up, the tube will tend to unroll and move the mechanical linkage. The pressure ranges for a Bourdon tube can be vast as its movement is dependent on the metal from which it is made. For instance, a stiffer metal will be fitted for higher pressures. A bi-metal temperature compensator is also fitted at the end of the ‘C’ tube to correct for the temperature of flowing fluid, which will alter the tube’s stiffness and efficiency.",

            "explanation": "A thermocouple functions as a temperature sensor, producing a voltage that corresponds to the temperature disparity between its two junctions. This voltage is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions. By measuring this voltage, one can determine the temperature at the hot junction. The fundamental principle of thermocouples lies in the thermoelectric effect, which generates a voltage across the two junctions when a temperature difference exists between them. Thus, the correct answer is \"A thermocouple generates a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between its two junctions.\" When one junction of two ‘dissimilar’ metals is heated a voltage proportional to the temperature between the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ junctions occurs, and current flows in the circuit. Two commonly used metals are Copper-Constantan and Iron-Constantan, which are both able to withstand high temperatures and produce a useable voltage. To measure high temperatures up to 1000°F and above a combination of Chromel-Alumel is used. Thermocouples are used on piston engines to measure the cylinder head temperature. These systemes are also used to operate exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauges on jet engines.",

On modern commercial jets, the primary source of information regarding the engine’s power is the N1 and the EPR. The N1, displayed to the pilots as a percentage, is nothing else than the compressor’s first stage rotation speed. The EPR is the ratio between the low-pressure turbine exhaust pressure (the engine’s last stage) and the engine inlet pressure (the fan’s pressure). The EGT is the temperature measured at the outlet of the turbine. It is measured by dozens of thermocouples with the hot junction mounted all around the turbine’s exhaust. The EGT is measured to monitor the engine performance and its degradation over time. When flying, if you notice that the EGT of one engine is slightly higher than the other’s one, it probably means the engine with the higher EGT is the oldest one. The N2 is the speed of the High-pressure compressor/turbine assembly. In modern commercial aircraft, this indicator is particularly useful during the engine start sequence when monitoring the start motor acceleration, the start of the fuel flow, etc.",

In simple terms, the dielectric permittivity represents the ability of electrical charges to propagate through the dielectric.

It is possible to rectify CAS solely for compressibility error, resulting in a dynamic pressure termed equivalent airspeed (EAS). Equivalent airspeed represents CAS corrected exclusively for compressibility error. True Airspeed (TAS) and Density Error: Unless the air surrounding the aircraft matches the calibration density of 1225 grams per cubic meter, a condition primarily achievable near sea level, the ASI cannot accurately indicate TAS. Dynamic pressure is directly proportional to density, so at higher altitudes where density decreases, the dynamic pressure for a given TAS is lower compared to the same TAS at sea level. Consequently, the expansion of the ASI capsule is proportionately reduced, leading to an indicated speed lower than the actual speed. In summary, the ASI underestimates true speed at altitude due to density being less than 1225 grams/cubic meter, a discrepancy known as 'density error.' Conversely, if density exceeds the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) at Mean Sea Level (MSL), the ASI will overstate the true speed. EAS + Density error = TAS",

Unreliable Airspeed describes a situation where the airspeed indicators on an aircraft are providing inaccurate or unreliable readings. Resolution of the discrepancy requires effortful reference to standby airspeed display and/or to pitch/power displays. Pilots may follow incorrect airspeed guidance into an undesired aircraft state or loss of control, because the airspeed display may appear valid and the process of identifying the discrepant display(s) may require substantial time. One of the obvious signs of unreliable airspeed is a difference between airspeed indications of redundant systems, probably accompanied by warnings from other aircraft systems. Boeing would display \"IAS disagree\" where a discrepancy of > 5 kt exists for > 5 sec. Unexpected aircraft behaviour, such as \"Buffeting\" or unusual pitch attitude could indicate an unreliable airspeed situation. \"Buffeting\", for instance, could be an indication of excessive or low speed.",

This could mean increasing indicated airspeed in a climb, decreasing airspeed in descent, or unpredictable indicated airspeed in cruise. If an unreliable airspeed condition occurs, the flight crew should be familiar with the approximate pitch attitude and thrust setting for each phase of flight. Once flight path is under control and the airplane is not in a critical phase of flight, the crew shall try to identify the erraneous airspeed indication. To determine if a reliable source of indicated airspeed is available, the flight crew should assess and compare flight deck indications. To aid the identification of a reliable airspeed indication, ground speed information is available from the FMC (from the INS/GNSS) and on the intrument displays. These indications can be used as a cross-check.",

            "explanation": "THE SENSITIVE ALTIMETER (figure 1) The sensitive altimeter employs a minimum of two aneroid capsules. This provides for a more accurate measurement of pressure and provides more power to drive the mechanical linkage. The movement of the capsules in response to changes in altitude (pressure) is transmitted via a suitable mechanical linkage to three pointers that display (against a graduated instrument scale) the aeroplane altitude in tens, hundreds, and thousands of feet. The whole assembly is encased in a container, which is fed with static pressure, but is otherwise completely airtight. SERVO ALTIMETERS (figure 2) Servo-assisted altimeters use the same basic principles as sensitive altimeters, whereby pressure changes are measured using the expansion and contraction of evacuated capsules. The instrument uses an electrical servomotor to transmit the movement of conventional aneroid capsules to the instrument display. A digital counter system and a single pointer indicate the altitude. SERVO-ALTIMETER POWER FAILURE In the event of power failure, the servo-altimeter does not function, and warning flags immediately display on the dial, indicating that the AC power supply failed. A standard sensitive altimeter is required as a standby instrument. Servo-altimeters have the following advantages over simple and sensitive altimeters: - At high altitude, very little pressure change takes place for a given change of altitude, with the result that capsule movement is considerably less than for the same change of altitude at lower levels. This factor reduces the efficiency of ordinary altimeters at high levels, whereas the servomechanism picks up a capsule movement as small as 0.0002 in per thousand ft. - Power transmission gives greater accuracy. - There is practically no time lag between the arrival of a new pressure in the instrument, and the positioning of the counters. - Because it is an electrical system, it is possible to correct for pressure error, and incorporate an altitude-alerting device in the system. - Although conventional altimeters now employ digital presentation, it is generally more common with servo-altimeters. The digital presentation reduces the possibility of misreading. - A pointer is still available on the servo-altimeter for use at low level in assessing the rate of change of altitude.",

If the density is increasing, but you maintain a lower airspeed relative to the airflow (TAS), you will pick up the same dynamic pressure (CAS).",

INSTANTANEOUS VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR (IVSI) The Instantaneous Vertical Speed Indicator (IVSI) consists of the same basic elements as the conventional VSI, but it is additionally fitted with an accelerometer unit that is designed to create a more rapid differential pressure effect, specifically during the initiation of climb or descent. The accelerometer comprises of two small cylinders or dashpots, which contain inertial masses in the form of pistons that are held in balance by springs and their own mass. The cylinders are connected in the capillary tube system leading to the capsule and are thus open to the static pressure source. OPERATION OF THE IVSI If a change in vertical motion is initiated, the resultant vertical acceleration (i.e. due to the change in vertical velocity along the aeroplanes vertical axis), produces a force and the pistons are displaced from their neutral position. The pistons are arranged so that one responds to nose up pitch changes (positive G) by reducing the capsule pressure, whilst the other responds to nose down pitch changes (negative G) by increasing the capsule pressure. The piston in the vertical acceleration pump immediately rises in the cylinder and causes a temporary change of pressure in the capsule. The capsule expands/compresses and the pointer will give an instant indication of descent/climb. The accelerometer output will decay after only a few seconds, and the pistons will automatically return to their neutral position, by which time a steady pressure differential is established across the metering unit. The instrument will then continue to behave like a conventional VSI. ERROR The errors are generally the same as those affecting the conventional VSI, although the lag and induced manoeuvre errors are virtually eliminated, with the instrument providing a rapid response to changes in the aeroplanes vertical flight path. The IVSI is affected by the acceleration forces, i.e. g–forces, which act on the pistons during steep turns when the angle of bank is in excess of 40°, and may produce a false reading, known as Turning Error.",

Consequently, for a given CAS, the TAS increases as altitude increase. The airspeed indicator displays TAS only at sea level under standard conditions, so you must calculate TAS based on IAS, the current pressure altitude and air temperature. The only temperature MEASURED (not calculated) in an aircraft usually fitted with an ADC (commercial aircraft) is the TAT; there’s no OAT probe. The OAT is internally calculated by the ADC by taking into account the ram rise and the recovery factor.

The sensitivity of an IVSI is very high and this results in the instrument overreacting in turbulent flying conditions. Small and sudden fluctuations should be ignored, instead pilots should monitor the trend of the vertical speed over time. Gradual changes, which occur in small stages over a long period of time, rather than suddenly, should be responded to slowly. In such conditions, the conventional VSI is superior to the IVSI. IMPORTANT NOTE: Please take note that we have two questions in our database that are quite similar. One of them pertains to gradual changes while the other pertains to small fluctuations. Our explanations should suffice in enabling you to answer these questions correctly. Nevertheless, kindly take extra care to observe the specific wording of the question to avoid any point deductions.",

In some light aeroplanes the complication and expense of separate pitot head(s) and static sources is often avoided by incorporating both functions into a combined pressure head. The combined head is usually mounted on a pylon below the wing toward the tip, thus reducing the position/pressure error to an acceptable level. Static pressure is admitted to the pressure head through slots or holes cut into the static casing at 90° to the airflow, whilst pitot pressure enters the head via the pitot input port that faces directly into the airflow. The different pressures are fed to the flight instruments via separate, seamless, and corrosion-resistant metal pipelines. This sensor is particularly prone to errors during manoeuvres, when changes in pitch can result in the pitot/static sources being presented to the relative airflow in such a way that the full dynamic pressure is not sensed. More significantly, dynamic pressure effects may also intrude into the static supply.",

The movement of the capsules in response to changes in altitude (pressure) is transmitted via a suitable mechanical linkage to three pointers that display (against a graduated instrument scale) the aeroplane altitude in tens, hundreds, and thousands of feet. The whole assembly is encased in a container, which is fed with static pressure, but is otherwise completely airtight. SERVO ALTIMETERS (figure 2) Servo-assisted altimeters use the same basic principles as sensitive altimeters, whereby pressure changes are measured using the expansion and contraction of evacuated capsules. The instrument uses an electrical servomotor to transmit the movement of conventional aneroid capsules to the instrument display. A digital counter system and a single pointer indicate the altitude. SERVO-ALTIMETER POWER FAILURE In the event of power failure, the servo-altimeter does not function, and warning flags immediately display on the dial, indicating that the AC power supply failed. A standard sensitive altimeter is required as a standby instrument. If the aircraft has forward motion, the static pressure sensed will be slightly lower than if the aircraft is stationary, due to suction. As the speed increases, due to turbulent airflow in the region of the pitot/static heads, this error becomes greater. Turbulence will also affect the pitot reading. The error involved is called Position Error (or alternatively ‘pressure’ error).",

Vertical speed indicators are supplied with static pressure from the static ports. The VSI is supplied with static pressure only, and thus is only affected by blockage of the static port of leakage of the static pressure line. A blockage of the static port makes it impossible for pressure changes to enter the static line and traps the pressure that existed at the moment when the blockage occurred. Since no pressure changes are transmitted to the capsule, the generation of a differential pressure over the capillary is impossible, and the conventional VSI indicates zero independently from the vertical rate.",

The resultant of this differential pressure will be the dynamic pressure (Pt – Ps = Pd) which will be mechanically transmitted to a pointer moving over a dial calibrated in knots (kn) or km/h.

One uses a vane (figure 1), known as an alpha-vane, externally mounted to the outside of the fuselage. It is free to rotate in the wind. As the AoA changes, air flowing over the vane changes its angle. The other one (figure 2), known as conical probe, uses two slots in a probe that extends out of the side of the fuselage into the airflow. The slots lead to different sides of movable paddles in a chamber of the unit just inside the fuselage skin. As the AoA varies, the air pressure ported by each of the slots changes and the paddles rotate to neutralize the pressures. Probes and vane detectors are mounted either side of the fuselage.

As the Mach No. remains constant, then our TAS also decreases. This is where it can get a little tricky. Our TAS has decreased, so our actually speed through the air is less. However, due to the colder air, the density of the air has increased. These changes happen by the same amount, and cancel each other out when it comes to CAS (Calibrated Air Speed) or IAS (Indicated Airspeed), meaning that this change in temperature (at constant Mach) does not change the IAS/CAS. Therefore, IAS remains constant. You can prove this mathematically using the dynamic pressure equation (1/2 x ρ x V2), ideal gas law equation, and the two Mach No. equations above if you wish, or use an online calculator and different temperature values, with a constant Mach Number. Important Note: This question initially came to us as feedback with incorrect options only (no option for IAS remaining the same).

Pitot pressure is fed into the capsule and static pressure is fed to the interior of the case, which, when the aeroplane is in motion, contains the lower pressure.

The wing’s angle of attack is the critical factor in determining how close the aircraft is to an aerodynamic stall. Therefore, an angle-of-attack (AoA) sensor is the ultimate stall warning and protection system. Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems and include a dedicated angle of attack sensor. At a predetermined angle of attack, calculated for each possible configuration, the Angle of Attack sensor triggers the activation of the stick shaker or the audible warning device as appropriate to the aircraft fitment. The stall warning must continue until the angle of attack has been reduced to approximately the initial angle of warning onset. If the angle of attack sensor is damaged, it will not send the required inputs upon reaching a predetermined angle of attack and the stall warning will not be activated.

Additionally, corrections to the TAT allow for the display of static air temperature (SAT). Note: We believe that the right option here should contain TAT instead of SAT.

For instance, the IAS (or CAS) will be too high than it is in reality, and a correction needs to be applied to account for the compressibility error to obtain the Equivalent Air Speed (EAS). The higher the airspeed, the higher the compressibility error. Besides the airspeed, the compressibility error is also influenced by the altitude. In fact, the less dense air at high altitudes is more easily compressed than at lower levels. The ASI’s calibration formulae include a factor addressing the compressibility of the air so that correct dynamic pressure is measured. Compressibility is becoming significant when the TAS exceeds 300 kt or the IAS is greater than 150 kt.",

Above a certain speed, the air molecules are hitting the pitot probe too fast to normally flow through the probe. This build-up creates a higher pressure and will result in an erroneous airspeed reading due to a higher dynamic pressure. This is the compressibility error, and it will induce the ASI to over-read. For instance, the IAS (or CAS) will be too high than it is in reality, and a correction needs to be applied to account for the compressibility error to obtain the Equivalent Air Speed (EAS). The higher the airspeed, the higher the compressibility error. Besides the airspeed, the compressibility error is also influenced by the altitude. In fact, the less dense air at high altitudes is more easily compressed than at lower levels. The ASI’s calibration formulae include a factor addressing the compressibility of the air, so that a correct dynamic pressure is measured. Up to about 200 kt CAS and an altitude of 10 000 ft, the compressibility error is not significant and the difference between the CAS and EAS is negligible. In order to find the TAS from the given IAS, you just need to divide your current altitude in feet (ft) by 600 to obtain the percentage difference: Altitude (in thousands) ÷ 600 = % increase",

The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Important aspects in this question: It is a very cold winter’s day. The aircraft is flying at an altitude with regional QNH. In the case of this specific question: Because it is a very cold winter’s day the density is increased. The altimeter will overread and the true altitude will be lower than indicated. If you would go up 27 feet the amount of pressure would decrease faster than in ISA conditions, it would be more than 1 hPa (millibar). So that is why at the altitude of the summit the pressure would be lower than in normal standard atmosphere conditions (ISA). Compared to the elevation of the summit the aneroid altimeter will give a higher indication. And this would be a dangerous condition when you fly in IMC conditions because you have less clearance with the mountain. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below!

However, the static pressure inside the case won’t change immediately and will lag behind the capsule.

The computer unit and displays, together with the sensors of the basic data of pitot pressure, static pressure and air temperature, and a power-pack, form the aircraft’s Air Data System (ADS). PITOT - STATIC SYSTEM In a typical aircraft, identical sets of air data instruments are provided on the Captain’s and First Officer’s instrument panels. Each set of instruments is connected to one of two (allowing redundancy) ADCs fed from independent pitot and static sources, which can be cross- connected. In addition to the indicators powered by the two ADCs there is a standby barometric altimeter and a standby airspeed indicator, fed direct from pitot and static sources separate from those used for the ADCs. Each of the three independent pitot-static systems makes use of cross-coupled static vents located on each side of the fuselage. This arrangement is designed to reduce error due to side-slip or yaw. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY Provision for blockages and/or failure of an ADC is made through change-over cocks that permit an alternative static source to be connected to the computer or by the use of electrical switching that enables the Captain’s instrument to be fed from the First Officer’s ADC and vice versa. The Manoeuvre Induced Error is caused by changes in the aeroplanes attitude and/or configuration and is normally only short term. The main sources of error are normally in the static supply. The pressure error changes if any of the following vary: - Airspeed - Angle of attack - Configuration (flap setting, undercarriage etc) - Position of the pitot/static sources and sideslip.",

To calculate TAS from CAS, the following variables must be calculated: Density and compressibility. => CAS is calculated from Total Pressure and Static Pressure. => Correction for density and compressibility comes from SAT and static pressure. SAT is calculated from Mach number and TAT. As the ADC already has static and dynamic pressure inputs, the answer is TAT. Note: The only possible correct option for this question was SAT for a long time, but we received some recent feedback indicating that TAT was an available option instead of SAT, and after checking it wasn't referring to a different question, we have changed this over in our database. This is much more correct now, and we hope that all EASA authorities have made this change, but please keep us informed about what you see in the real exam, thank you! In summary, the correct answer here is TAT, but if that is not an option and only SAT is present, then you may have to choose that as the \"most correct\" answer.",

The laws of thermodynamics are such that the combination of kinetic and adiabatic heating will always add up to a figure known as the Total Ram Rise. Static Air Temperature (SAT): SAT is the temperature of the undisturbed air through which the aircraft is about to fly. OAT on its own is usually taken to mean SAT. Total Air Temperature (TAT): TAT is the maximum temperature attainable by the air when brought to rest adiabatically. Ram Rise: Ram rise is the difference between the SAT and the TAT (Total Ram Rise) or the difference between the SAT and the RAT (Measured Ram Rise). TAT = SAT + Ram Rise",

            "explanation": "Conical slotted probe – consists of a cylindrical case extending from the aircraft’s skin with a central shaft perpendicular to the relative airflow, which is free to rotate through a limited range of angles. The central extending shaft is fitted with two rows of front-facing slots cut near the outer end of the shaft. The airflow entering the slots is directed through internal ducts to two paddle compartments found inside the cylindrical case. The working principle is based on the pressure sensing of the relative airflow flowing through the slots. The pressure from one slot will affect the position of both paddles – one duct will make the paddles rotate in a clockwise direction, and the other duct will induce an anti-clockwise rotation of the shaft. As long as the pressure sensed through the slots (and transmitted through the ducts) is equal, the paddles are not moving. However, if the shaft is displaced in regard to the relative airflow (with aircraft’s pitch changes), a higher pressure will be transmitted to the paddles through one of the ducts, and the shaft will rotate. This rotation is transmitted to a potentiometer and the output voltage, proportional to the angle of attack (AoA), is further sent to the different warning devices and systems requiring the AoA. ---------------------------------- As you can see, the probe A has the lower slot that is more exposed into the relative airflow than the upper slot. Therefore, more pressure is going to flow through that lower slot. This will cause a higher pressure over the associated paddle which will push over it and induce an anti-clockwise rotation of the probe. Following the same reasoning, you can easily understand the motion of the probes illustrated in the other figures: Probe B will induce a clockwise rotation of the probe. Probe C is almost totally aligned with the relative airflow, therefore, considering the simplicity of the diagram, the probe will not have any movement. Probe D doesn’t seem to have the relative airflow directly facing it (= no air flowing through the slots).",

            "explanation": "A mechanical machmeter looks more like a complex airspeed indicator. In fact, the instrument consists of 2 capsules and several mechanical connections to provide the Mach number. The altitude capsule (aneroid) and the pitot capsule are connected through a ratio arm (the main mechanical connection) and convert the pitot-static pressure into Mach number. Therefore, you would be tempted to answer with both ‘aneroid capsule’ and ‘differential pressure capsule’. However, the question is asking specifically about the VMO/MMO pointer connection. In fact, the barber pole is connected only to the aneroid capsule as it is calibrated to indicate the MMO according to the variation of the Local Speed of Sound (LSS). LSS is inversely proportional to altitude and reaching a certain altitude the MMO will start decreasing and become the limiting speed (instead of VMO). Therefore, altitude is the most important variable and it’s measured by the aneroid capsule inside the machmeter.",

In simple words, the machmeter is a simple airspeed indicator containing an altitude capsule, giving as output the ratio between dynamic and static pressure. M = (Pt – Ps) ÷ Ps Pt: Pitot pressure (total). Ps: Static pressure. There’s no temperature measuring element in the machmeter, so the variations in temperature and density from the standard atmosphere have no effect on the indicated Mach number. It is true that the Mach number is the ratio between the TAS and the LSS.

The movement of the capsules in response to changes in altitude (pressure) is transmitted via a suitable mechanical linkage to three pointers that display (against a graduated instrument scale) the aeroplane altitude in tens, hundreds, and thousands of feet. The whole assembly is encased in a container, which is fed with static pressure, but is otherwise completely airtight. The pressure altimeter suffers from a few errors, including Time Lag: Because the response of the capsule and linkage is not instantaneous, the altimeter needle tends to lag behind whenever the altitude changes. Subsequent over-indication during descent is possibly dangerous, but is allowed in rapid descents. Time lag is virtually eliminated in the servo- assisted altimeter.",

This means that the TAS will continuously increase during a climb. But, at higher altitudes, the LSS is much lower than at the ground level, so the aircraft will be limited by the Mach number. The aircraft will eventually reach an altitude where if it continues to maintain a constant CAS, the TAS will continue to increase and shockwaves will form over the wing as the aircraft will reach the critical Mach number. Therefore, there needs to be a certain altitude from which the aircraft is switching from maintaining a constant CAS, to maintaining a constant Mach number. This altitude is called the changeover altitude and from this point, the aircraft will maintain a constant Mach number. M = TAS ÷ LSS If the Mach number is constant, it means that the above equation needs to be balanced. At the changeover altitude, LSS continues to decrease (because of the decreasing temperature with height), so the TAS (and the CAS) needs to be decreased to maintain a constant Mach number. To summarize: CAS is constant and TAS is continuously increasing until the changeover altitude where VMO = MMO. At the changeover altitude, the Mach number is constant and the TAS and CAS decrease.",

One uses a vane (figure 1), known as an alpha vane, externally mounted to the outside of the fuselage. It is free to rotate in the wind. As the AoA changes, air flowing over the vane changes its angle. The other (figure 2) uses two slots in a probe that extends out of the side of the fuselage into the airflow. The slots lead to different sides of movable paddles in a chamber of the unit just inside the fuselage skin. As the AoA varies, the air pressure ported by each of the slots changes and the paddles rotate to neutralize the pressures. The shaft upon which the paddles rotate connects to a potentiometer wiper contact that is part of the unit. The same is true of the shaft of the alpha vane. The changing resistance of the potentiometer is used in a balanced bridge circuit to signal a motor in the indicator to move the pointer proportional to the AoA. AoA sensors of the type described are subject to position error since airflow around the alpha vane and slotted probe changes somewhat with airspeed and aircraft attitude. The errors are small, but can be corrected in the ADC.",

The Total Air Temperature (TAT) is the OAT plus the kinetic heating (ram rise) due to compressibility resulting from the aircraft’s motion through the air. Therefore, the TAT can only be higher or equal to the SAT. Relationship between the TAT and SAT using the Mach number: TAT = SAT (1 + 0.2M2) SAT = TAT ÷ (1 + K x 0.2 x M2) Relationship between the TAT and SAT using the TAS: TAT = SAT + (TAS ÷ 100)2 SAT = TAT – K (TAS ÷ 100)2 Where K is the recovery factor (the percentage of the measured ram rise). The recovery factor (K) represents the percentage of the kinetic energy of the relative airflow that the temperature probe recovers in reducing the velocity of the airstream. Therefore, for a recovery factor of 0.85, the sensing element will measure the ambient air temperature (SAT) plus 85% of the ram rise.",

Conical slotted probe – consists of a cylindrical case extending from the aircraft’s skin with a central shaft perpendicular to the relative airflow, which is free to rotate through a limited range of angles. The central extending shaft is fitted with two rows of front-facing slots cut near the outer end of the shaft. The airflow entering the slots is directed through internal ducts to two paddle compartments found inside the cylindrical case. The working principle is based on the pressure sensing of the relative airflow flowing through the slots. The pressure from one slot will affect the position of both paddles – one duct will make the paddles rotate in a clockwise direction, and the other duct will induce an anti-clockwise rotation of the shaft. As long as the pressure sensed through the slots (and transmitted through the ducts) is equal, the paddles are not moving. However, if the shaft is displaced in regard to the relative airflow (with aircraft’s pitch changes), a higher pressure will be transmitted to the paddles through one of the ducts, and the shaft will rotate. This rotation is transmitted to a potentiometer and the output voltage, proportional to the angle of attack (AoA), is further sent to the different warning devices and systems requiring the AoA. Vane-type AoA probe – consists of the same cylindrical case fitted inside the aircraft with a small airfoil-shaped vane extending out of the aircraft skin. The vane is facing the relative airflow and is usually situated in a place where position error is not significant as it can affect the AoA probe’s indication. The changes in the AoA are picked-up by a synchro and are transmitted to other systems or warning devices.",

The standby altitude and airspeed measurements are totally part of the ADC, however, this data is the primary input to the ADC.

            "explanation": "PRINCIPLE OF THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR (ASI) When an aeroplane is stationary on the ground it is subject to normal atmospheric or static pressure, which acts equally on all parts of the aeroplane structure. In flight, the aeroplane experiences an additional pressure due to the aeroplane's motion through the air, which is known as dynamic pressure, and is dependent upon the forward motion of the aeroplane and the density of the air. The airspeed indicator thus measures the pressure differential between the two sources, and provides a display indication graduated in units of speed. BLOCKAGES - PITOT TUBE (figure 1) A blockage of the pitot tube, possibly due to ice, causes the ASI to not respond to changes of speed in level flight. The capsule behaves as a barometer or altimeter capsule, and reacts to changes in the static pressure. If the aeroplane climbs, the ASI indicates an increase in airspeed (over-read) and if it descends, it indicates a decrease in airspeed (under-read). BLOCKAGES - PITOT TUBE (figure 2) A blocked static source during descent will mean that the ‘old’ (higher altitude) static pressure surrounding the capsule will be lower than it should be, so that if the pitot supply is normal the ASI will over-read. A climb with blocked static source and normal pitot air will result in the ASI under-reading. With a blocked static source, the ASI over-reads in a descent. A useful mnemonic for examinations is PUDSOD, which stands for: ‘Pitot Blocked: – Under-reads in Descent Static Blocked: – Over-reads in Descent’ The opposite of this can also be concluded: ‘Pitot Blocked: – Over-reads in Climb Static Blocked: – Under-reads in Climb’",

This build-up creates a higher pressure and will result in an erroneous airspeed reading due to a higher dynamic pressure. This is the compressibility error, and it will induce the ASI to over-read. For instance, the IAS (or CAS) will be too high than it is in reality, and a correction needs to be applied to account for the compressibility error to obtain the Equivalent Air Speed (EAS). The higher the airspeed, the higher the compressibility error. Besides the airspeed, the compressibility error is also influenced by the altitude. In fact, the less dense air at high altitudes is more easily compressed than at lower levels. The ASI’s calibration formulae include a factor addressing the compressibility of the air so that correct dynamic pressure is measured. Compressibility is becoming significant when the TAS exceeds 300 kt or the IAS is greater than 150 kt.",

            "explanation": "THE SENSITIVE ALTIMETER (figure 1) The sensitive altimeter employs a minimum of two aneroid capsules. This provides for a more accurate measurement of pressure and provides more power to drive the mechanical linkage. The movement of the capsules in response to changes in altitude (pressure) is transmitted via a suitable mechanical linkage to three pointers that display (against a graduated instrument scale) the aeroplane altitude in tens, hundreds, and thousands of feet. The whole assembly is encased in a container, which is fed with static pressure, but is otherwise completely airtight. SERVO ALTIMETERS (figure 2) Servo-assisted altimeters use the same basic principles as sensitive altimeters, whereby pressure changes are measured using the expansion and contraction of evacuated capsules. The instrument uses an electrical servomotor to transmit the movement of conventional aneroid capsules to the instrument display. A digital counter system and a single pointer indicate the altitude. SERVO ALTIMETERS - PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION (figure 3) The principle of the servo altimeter is that the small movements of the capsules are detected by a very sensitive electromagnetic pick-off. This produces an electric current which is amplified and used to drive a motor which rotates the counters and pointer. AC is fed to the middle leg of the E bar, setting up alternating magnetic fields in the outer legs ‘A’ and ‘B’. The coils on these two legs are wound 180° out of phase. The exciter therefore induces a current in each leg, but since these are 180° out of phase and of equal strength, they cancel each other out when the I bar is equidistant from the legs of the E bar (that is when no pressure change acts on the capsules). With a change of pressure the capsules expand or contract, moving the I bar on its pivot, closing the gap between the I Bar and E Bar at one end and opening it at the other. This causes an imbalance of magnetic fields and therefore of the currents induced in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ coils. The imbalance causes an error signal which is passed to the amplifier, where it is amplified and rectified, and thence to the servomotor. The servomotor drives the counter-pointer system of the altimeter and at the same time, via a cam drive, re-aligns the E Bar with the I Bar. Once re-aligned, the error signal ceases and the altimeter indicates the correct height.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

Two types of ADC exist – analog and digital. Initially, only the temperature and the pitot/static pressures were provided to the ADC. From these inputs it was able to compute and provide airspeed (Pt - Ps = CAS/IAS), Mach number, altitude, TAS and GS indications. However, now, the AOA probe also provides inputs to the ADC. All this data is joined together and is transmitted from the ADC to other systems such as the FMS, AFCS, TAWS, TCAS, transponder, EFIS (via the symbol generator) etc. The only temperature measured in an aircraft usually fitted with an ADC (commercial aircraft) is the TAT; there’s no OAT probe.

            "explanation": "Conical slotted probe – consists of a cylindrical case extending from the aircraft’s skin with a central shaft perpendicular to the relative airflow, which is free to rotate through a limited range of angles. The central extending shaft is fitted with two rows of front-facing slots cut near the outer end of the shaft. The airflow entering the slots is directed through internal ducts to two paddle compartments found inside the cylindrical case. The working principle is based on the pressure sensing of the relative airflow flowing through the slots. The pressure from one slot will affect the position of both paddles – one duct will make the paddles rotate in a clockwise direction, and the other duct will induce an anti-clockwise rotation of the shaft. As long as the pressure sensed through the slots (and transmitted through the ducts) is equal, the paddles are not moving. However, if the shaft is displaced in regard to the relative airflow (with aircraft’s pitch changes), a higher pressure will be transmitted to the paddles through one of the ducts, and the shaft will rotate. This rotation is transmitted to a potentiometer and the output voltage, proportional to the angle of attack (AoA), is further sent to the different warning devices and systems requiring the AoA. ------------------------- As you can see, the probe B has the lower slot that is more exposed into the relative airflow than the upper slot. Therefore, more pressure is going to flow through that lower slot. This will cause a higher pressure over the associated paddle which will push over it and induce an anti-clockwise rotation of the probe. Following the same reasoning, you can easily understand the motion of the probes illustrated in the other figures: Probe A is almost totally aligned with the relative airflow, therefore, considering the simplicity of the diagram, the probe will not have any movement. Probe C will induce a clockwise rotation of the probe. Probe D doesn’t seem to have the relative airflow directly facing it (= no air flowing through the slots).",

This build-up creates a higher pressure and will result in an erroneous airspeed reading due to a higher dynamic pressure. This is the compressibility error, and it will induce the ASI to over-read. For instance, the IAS (or CAS) will be too high than it is in reality, and a correction needs to be applied to account for the compressibility error to obtain the equivalent Air Speed (EAS). The higher the airspeed, the higher the compressibility error. Besides the airspeed, the compressibility error is also influenced by the altitude. In fact, the less dense air at high altitudes is more easily compressed than at lower levels. The ASI’s calibration formulae include a factor addressing the compressibility of the air so that correct dynamic pressure is measured. Compressibility is becoming significant when the TAS exceeds 300 kt or the IAS is greater than 200 kt.",

If the aircraft exceeds the normal flight envelope for any reason, the pilot is immediately made aware of the situation by the pitch auto-trim stop and the aft pressure required on the stick to keep the flight path. The high angle of attack protection is an aerodynamic protection but thrust is required to maintain the flight path and the auto-thrust function would automatically provide TOGA thrust when the aircraft reaches a certain value of Angle of Attack. The input to the circuit is the angle of attack and the output is applied to the elevators and the auto-thrust. If the angle of attack input is incorrect (too low) it is possible that the critical angle of attack is exceeded without warning to the pilot.",

If one of the variables is changing (for example TAS), the other one (LSS) needs to change in the same way to equalize the relationship. Temperature increases with decreasing altitude. Since the LSS is directly proportional to the temperature, it means the LSS is increasing with decreasing altitude as well. Therefore, the TAS needs to increase as well to balance the above equation and output a constant Mach number. CAS is the dynamic pressure, which is the number of air molecules that will hit the pitot probe. If the density is increasing (the aircraft is descending), and you maintain a higher airspeed relative to the airflow (TAS), you will pick up a higher dynamic pressure (CAS).",
