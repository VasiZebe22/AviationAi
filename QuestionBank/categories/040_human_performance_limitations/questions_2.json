The vestibular system, located in the inner ear, consists of the vestibule and three semicircular canals. The utricle and saccule organs are within the vestibule, and are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense angular accelerations in yaw, pitch and roll. This question mentions the \"anterior\" semicircular canal, which is also called the superior canal, and is the one which senses pitch (nodding ones head is felt by this canal). The exact canals and their names are above the syllabus, though, which does not stop you answering this question. They are extremely sensitive, and can be prone to errors such as \"the leans\", due to the way that they work, with fluid inside the canals that moves sensory hairs to detect the different accelerations. A common error is when a pilot has been turning for a while, and rolls out of the turn, their vestibular system has reset slightly in the turn, and now believes that they have banked the opposite direction, instead of being straight and level. The other options all exist within the ear, but are parts of the auditory system, which allows us to hear sounds. The ossicles are made up of the malleus, incus and stapes. Although both the vestibular system and the auditory system exist within the ear, they try and stay as isolated from each other as possible, although extremely loud noises can vibrate the vestibular apparatus, giving balance problems.",

Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

The choice of tints for sunglasses is practically infinite. The three most common tints are gray, gray-green, and brown, any of which would be an excellent choice for the aviator. Yellow, amber, and orange tints are not recommended as they eliminate short-wavelength light from reaching the wearer’s eyes and reportedly sharpen vision. In addition, these tints are known to distort colors, making it difficult to distinguish the color of navigation lights, signals, or color-coded maps and instrument displays. PHOTOCHROMIC. (automatically tinting glasses) These lenses react with UV radiation by darkening. As the cockpit windshield is designed to block the transmission of UV light, these lenses will not work as effectively in the cockpit environment. The use of these sunglasses is therefore discouraged. For flying, sunglass lenses should screen out only 70 - 85% of visible light and not appreciably distort color. Tints that block more than 85% of visible light are not recommended for flying due to the possibility of reduced visual acuity, resulting in difficulty seeing instruments and written material inside the cockpit.",

The leans/somatogyral illusion occur when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. If you make such a recovery, your semicircular canals sense a roll in the opposite direction. This may cause you to reenter the original attitude. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans. Note: Sensory adaptation is a reduction in sensitivity to a stimulus after constant exposure to it.",

CORIOLIS ILLUSION Coriolis illusion happens when you're in a constant turn long enough for the fluid in your ears to stop moving. When the fluid in your ears stops moving, your brain thinks it is 'straight-and-level'. At this point, if you move your head too quickly, such as tilting your head down to change a fuel tank or pick up a pen, you can start the fluid in your ears moving in an entirely different axis. This makes you feel like the airplane is maneuvering in a way that it isn't, an overwhelming sensation of rotating, turning, or accelerating along an entirely different plane. An attempt to stop the sensation by maneuvering the plane may put it into a dangerous attitude. To avoid this illusion, do not move your head too fast in limited visibility or darkness.",

Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. When the pilot realizes that he has just escaped a mid-air collision, he experiences symptoms of initial stress reaction: \"fight or flight\" response. The perception of threat activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body to fight or flee but may be experienced as uncomfortable when you do not know why they are happening. During the \"Fight or Flight\" response, your heart beats faster. A faster heart beat feeds more blood to the muscles and enhances your ability to run away or fight. Breathing becomes quicker and shallower. Quicker breathing takes in more oxygen to power the muscles. This makes the body more able to fight or run away.",

This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high.

            "explanation": "The four statements include aviation examples for four forms of hypoxia: \"1. A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen. \"2. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurisation and supplemental oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"3. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolise oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to histotoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histotoxic hypoxia. \"4. Blood pooling in the lower extremities due to inertia (+Gz).\" CORRECT. This statement refers to ischemic/stagnant hypoxia - Reduced brain oxygen is caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain. This can occur as a result of positive accelerations (+Gz) - lack of blood in the upper body parts because it is pulled down by gravity.",

Consequently, for instance, when flying above 10 000 ft without supplemental oxygen, oxygen deficiency in the body will most likely result in hypoxia. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement and vision, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), and limp muscles.

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Sleep Regulation. How we sleep is regulated by two internal biological mechanisms. These two systems work together to regulate when we are awake and when we sleep. Sleep is regulated by two independent, yet interrelated processes. These two processes are: Homeostatic Sleep Drive Circadian Rhythm - Your circadian rhythm helps control your daily schedule for sleep and wakefulness. These processes play a role in sleep regulation with regards to: sleep timing sleep intensity sleep duration Elevated Sleep Drive. Pressure for sleep builds up in our body as our time awake increases. The pressure gets stronger the longer we stay awake and decreases during sleep, reaching a low after a full night of good-quality sleep. The homeostatic process begins to build again after we awaken. Homeostatic sleep drive - refers to the \"normal\" sleep drive, your usual, optimum, daily (or nightly) sleep drive. Whereas ELEVATED sleep drive => makes you more driven to sleep at times you wouldn't usually. Sleep Desynchronisation. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization between internal sleep-wake rhythms and the light-darkness cycle. Patients typically have insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or both, which typically resolve as the body clock realigns itself. Desynchronisation may result in symptoms such as sleep alteration, persistent fatigue, sleep medication dependence, and mood disturbances, including depression. Sleep inertia. Refers to the transitional state between sleep and wake, marked by impaired performance, reduced vigilance, and a desire to return to sleep. The intensity and duration of sleep inertia vary based on situational factors, but its effects may last minutes to several hours.",

Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. As a recommendation, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.",

In recent years concerns have been expressed about possible adverse health effects of exposure to contaminants in cabin air. More specifically, the term “fume event” is used to refer to a potentially toxic environment created by contaminated bleed air used to pressurize and ventilate aircraft cockpit and cabins. An oil spill in front of the landing gear may indicate a leak in the hydraulic system. This is hazardous as some of the fluid may enter the Bleed Air system, which may lead to a fume event. Purple trails of fluid from gaps in the wing or tail surfaces may indicate a leak in the hydraulic system. However, it is unlikely that, in this locations, the hydraulic fluid will contaminate the Bleed Air system.

            "explanation": "ALCOHOL Alcohol acts as a sedative, so it can help you feel more at ease. It may make you feel more socially confident at a party or help you forget your worries. However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular acelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control.

Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body breaks down sugars (glucose) and starches. Glucose is a vital source of energy for human cells and tissues, and its levels in the bloodstream need to be carefully controlled. This control is primarily managed by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes is categorised as type 1 and 2. Type 1 Diabetes This type is usually diagnosed in children and young adults but can occur at any age. In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As a result, the body doesn't produce insulin, and individuals with Type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump to regulate their blood sugar levels. Type 2 Diabetes This type usually effects adults. This is the most common form of diabetes and is often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity and lack of physical activity. In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas may not produce enough insulin or the body is unable to effectively use the insulin (insulin resistant). Treatment may involve lifestyle changes, oral medications and in some cases insulin therapy. EASA AIR CREW MED. B.025 Metabolic and Endocrine Systems (a) Applicants with metabolic, nutritional or endocrine dysfunction may be assessed as fit subject to demonstrated stability of the medical condition and satisfactory aero-medical evaluation. (b) Diabetes mellitus (1) Applicants with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit. (2) Applicants with diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit unless it can be demonstrated that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. (c) Aero-medical assessment (1) Applicants for a class 1 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be referred to the medical assessor of the licensing authority. (2) The fitness of applicants for a class 2 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be assessed in consultation with the medical assessor of the licensing authority. Diabetes Type 2 usually affects adults and it may not require insulin treatment. A pilot will be assessed as unfit to fly if it cannot be demonstrated that his/her blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. If it can be demonstrated that his/her blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable, the pilot will be assessed as fit to fly.

For comfort, human beings require a relative humidity of 40% to 60%, which corresponds to the normal humidity of the atmosphere. The humidity of the air in pressurised aircraft is typically only 5 to 15 %. Such difference results from the air conditioning system of modern aircraft drawing air from outside the aircraft - At airline operating altitudes, the air is very cold and can only hold very little amount of water vapour. Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. Newer aircraft built for passenger comfort have actually begun to add humidifiers to reduce this effect, but they are heavy to carry around. This very low humidity (very dry environment) should be compensated by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration, using eye drops and aqueous creams. A water based moisturizer is best for those with dehydrated skin that is in need of moisture, and oily moisturisers are not as good for this.",

It passes through a small shutter which can either be flawed or can become jammed causing a rise in pressure of the eye. There are two main kinds of Glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision; Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Therefore, oxygen saturation decreases with decreasing pressure and increasing altitude.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.01.03.04: List the factors that affect the relative humidity of both the atmosphere and cabin air. Note: This question does mention humidity, but from the learning objectives, general understanding and other similar questions, we strongly believe that the examiner is referring to relative humidity in this question, a much more commonly used metric. Also, if they were referring to absolute humidity, only the outside air temperature would make a difference (within normal temperature ranges), which would make two answers equally correct. Relative humidity is a measure of how much water vapour is in the air as a percentage of how much water vapour the air can hold in total. Warm air can hold more water vapour than colder air, therefore, for the same amount of water, the relative humidity in warm air is lower. This means that the lowest relative humidity in the cabin will occur when the cabin is warm. In the same way, to have the lowest relative humidity in the cabin, there has to be a small amount of water in the air. The way to do this is to have a cold outside air temperature, because that causes the outside air to hold less water in the first place. Especially if the aircraft was flying through a cloud, which has 100% relative humidity, there would be less water in the air if the air was colder. This means that we require a very cold temperature outside and high temperature inside the cabin to get the lowest relative humidity. This is a practical subject for human performance and limitations as humidity is often very low on aircraft, which causes dryness effects, that need to be counteracted sometimes. In the past, humidifiers were removed from many aircraft for weight saving, making the relative humidity as low as 3-5% in some cases.",

            "explanation": "This is not an easy question to answer. You will likely have to go through each option to rule them out. We believe that this question could be asking about visual illusions. If you see a mountain, but do not check how big it is, then illusions can creep into your visual processing, and you might begin to believe you are an acceptable distance from it, when actually, you are much too low, or too close to the mountainside. It is a difficult question as it does not really specify what visual illusions we might expect whilst flying through valleys etc., and it is difficult to choose one based on this question wording alone. The other option is that the question is talking about the psychology/behaviour of the pilot. Not planning ahead, not keeping a good situational awareness, etc. When doing valley flying (low-level mountain flying), not being aware of the local terrain can be deadly, as you can get stuck in a tight valley (no turn around option) with rising terrain, and possibly even a downdraft wind, meaning that the aircraft's climb gradient may not be sufficient to outclimb the terrain. We can't quite tell what is being asked, but thankfully, the other options are incorrect. Judging speed should not really be an issue, it won't lead to close encounters with aircraft, and unless the aircraft is planning to land with very little fuel, the groundspeed is not a major hazard (as long as the airspeed is fine, of course). The question has not mentioned anything about haze, mist, any other visual obscurations, so atmospheric perspective is unlikely to be an issue.",

Once alcohol is in the bloodstream, it can only be eliminated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, sweat, urine, and breath. Drinking water and sleeping will not speed up the process.

Two pathways come from the heart: The pulmonary circulation is a short loop from the heart to the lungs and back again. The systemic circulation carries blood from the heart to all the other parts of the body and back again. Deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a big artery that comes from the heart and brings blood from the heart to the lungs. At the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. The blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Next, blood that returns to the heart has picked up lots of oxygen from the lungs. So it can now go out to the body. The aorta is a big artery that leaves the heart carrying this oxygenated blood.",

This disturbance of the acid balance has a number of effects, the major one being that haemoglobin gives up its oxygen readily only in an acid medium. As a result, tissues suffer from lack of O2. Some causes of sudden hyperventilation include anxiety, fever, some medicines, intense exercise, and emotional stress. \"Poor saturation of oxygen\" Incorrect. Blood oxygen saturation can even be 100%, however this oxygen will not be of much use to the tissues because it is bonded to the haemoglobin more firmly than in an acidic medium and can only diffuse into the tissues very pooorly.",

Since sunglasses are an important asset, whether or not refractive correction is required, careful consideration should be used when selecting an appropriate pair for flying. While adding to the mystique of an aviator, sunglasses protect a pilot’s eyes from glare associated with bright sunlight and the harmful effects from exposure to solar radiation. The choice of tints for use in the aviation environment should be limited to those that optimize visual performance while minimizing color distortion, such as a neutral gray tint with 15 - 30% light transmittance. Polarized sunglasses are not recommended because of their possible interaction with displays or other materials in the cockpit environment.",

This type of hypoxia is particularly significant for pilots, as it poses a real threat to flight crew and passengers in commercial aviation, where operations often occur at high altitudes where oxygen partial pressure is reduced. Anaemic Hypoxia is caused by a decreased ability of the blood to carry oxygen.

As a result, conditions like carbon monoxide poisoning and even smoking can lead to this type of hypoxia. \"It results from a blood flow reduction through the tissues.\" ⇒ This describes Ischaemic hypoxia, which may be caused by, for example, obstruction of arterial supply by disease or trauma. \"It results from an interference with the tissues ability to utlize a normal oxygen supply for oxidative processes.\" ⇒ This describes Histotoxic hyoxia, which may be cause by certain biochemical disorders or poisoning resulting from, for instance, drug misuse, chronic alcohol abuse, poison.",

In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal sleep is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase. => During any normal night’s sleep, the pattern operates on an approximately 90 minutes cycle. Towards the end of the first 90 minutes od falling asleep, the first REM stage occurs, but this first REM experience lasts only 10 to 20 minutes before the person passes back into slow wave sleep. At the end of the second cycle of 90 min, the duration of REM sleep periods increases. During a 8 hour sleep period, an individual is likely to experience 4 to 5 REM sleep episodes.",

EASA distinguishes three physiological thresholds: Reaction threshold. The altitude of 7 000 ft is referred to as the reaction threshold. It is the altitude at which even a healthy person may start to experience symptoms of hypoxia. Above this limit, the body reacts to the decreasing oxygen supply by increasing the rate and depth of breathing as well as the stroke volume to ensure full performance. Disturbance threshold. The altitude band of 10 000 to 12 000 ft is called the disturbance threshold, because the compensatory mechanisms of the body are not powerful enoughto ensure full operation. Performance will be reduced and flight safety may be impaired. Critical threshold. The altitude of 22 000 ft is referred to as the critical threshold. The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is reduced to equal the minimum required blood partial pressure, no diffusion of oxygen into the blookd will be possible.",

They act outwards from the centre of rotation and are experienced whenever an aircraft changes direction (predominantly +Gz). This type of acceleration is the most significant to pilots. During radial accelerations, fluid and tissues are displaced downwards. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms.",

The centre of the retina is called the fovea and the receptors in this area are all cones. Moving outwards, the cones become less dense and are gradually replaced by rods - in the periphery there are no cones. CONES. used for direct vision and are colour-sensitive; RODS. the maximum density of rods is found about 10º from the fovea - rods are responsible for our peripheral vision. The rods can only detect black and white but are much more sensitive at lower llight levels. As light decreases, the sensing task is passed over from the cones to the rods. => In dim light it is easier to focus on an object if you look slightly away from it. As the fovea contains no rods, which would be required for vision is very low brightness levels, the centre part of the eye becomes blind to dim light. It is then necessary to look away from the visual target so that the peripherally located rods can perform their sensing task.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Pilot eye height from the ground may be the source of misjudged speed. Pilots converting to an aircraft with an eye position that is higher than on their previous type will have their normal visual references at a greater distance, which will give the illusion of slower relative motion, and in the initial stages of training they may well taxi at excessive speeds as a result.

Yellow, amber, and orange tints are not recommended as they eliminate short-wavelength light from reaching the wearer’s eyes and reportedly sharpen vision. In addition, these tints are known to distort colors, making it difficult to distinguish the color of navigation lights, signals, or color-coded maps and instrument displays. PHOTOCHROMIC. (automatically tinting glasses) These lenses react with UV radiation by darkening. As the cockpit windshield is designed to block the transmission of UV light, these lenses will not work as effectively in the cockpit environment. The use of these sunglasses is therefore discouraged. For flying, sunglass lenses should screen out only 70 - 85% of visible light and not appreciably distort color. Tints that block more than 85% of visible light are not recommended for flying due to the possibility of reduced visual acuity, resulting in difficulty seeing instruments and written material inside the cockpit.",

Nicotine is the addictive chemical in cigarettes but it is the tar that is responsible for the biggest health risks, including many types of cancer. \"2. Smoking increases the physiological altitude by about 1 000 to 3 000 ft compared to non-smokers.\" Incorrect. Smoking cigarettes reduces the capability of the blood to carry oxygen because haemoglobin has a greater affinity for carbon monoxide than it has for oxygen => which results in an increase in physiological altitude. However, it is not possible to say by how much. \"3. Abstinence from tobacco can cause irritability and limited ability to concentrate in regular smokers.\" Correct. The withdrawal from cigarette smoking can be acutely unpleasant, to be sure. In a report on the withdrawal experiences of self-quitters, many unpleasant feelings and symptoms - such as irritability, concentration issues, cravings, and weight gain increased when the person quit were reported. \"4. Smokers have an increased risk to suffer from myocardial infarction and stroke.\" Correct. Smokers not only have increased risk of lung disease, including lung cancer and emphysema, but also have increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and oral cancer. \"5. Cancer of the urinary tract is more often found with smokers.\" Correct. A study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that 50% of all cases of bladder cancer are found in smokers. Former smokers are twice as likely to develop the disease as those who never smoked; current smokers are four times more likely. Correct option: 3, 4, 5",

From 34 000 ft to 40 000 ft, pilots must breathe 100% oxygen. Without pressurization, sufficient oxygen can be delivered up to an altitude of about 40 000 ft (12 000 m). At 40 000 ft, the ambient air pressure falls to about 0.2 bar, at which maintaining a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 bar requires breathing 100% oxygen under positive pressure. 34 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL 38 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 8 000 ft 40 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 10 000 ft 45 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 20 000 ft => Above 40 000 ft, breathing 100% oxygen without pressure is not sufficient.

Hypoxia is a condition characterized by an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body's tissues Three of the four statements include aviation examples for four forms of hypoxia: \"2. A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen. \"3. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurisation and supplemental oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"4. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolise oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to histotoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histotoxic hypoxia.",

This rapid decompression causes nitrogen and other inert gases, which are normally dissolved in body tissues and fluids, to form bubbles. This process is similar to how bubbles appear in a soda when it's opened. The bubbles can cause various symptoms, including pain in major joints like the elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees, and ankles, as well as more severe effects such as seizures and loss of consciousness. The severity of these symptoms depends on how quickly and how much the pressure changes. In extreme cases, DCS can be fatal. Symptoms Bends. Bubbles in the joints cause rheumatic-like pain. Movement or rubbing the affected areas worsens the pain, but descending usually alleviates the issue. This is the most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. (This will require the crew to declare a mayday in most cases). The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

However, if a person has been in bright light for a long time, large proportions of the photochemicals in both the cones and rods are reduced thereby reducing the sensitivity of the eye to light. Thus going quickly from outside on a sunny day into a darkened room has the effect of vision being severely reduced until dark adaptation takes place. Dark Adaptation. On the other hand, if a person remains in darkness for a long time the reverse takes place and both the cones and rods gradually become super-sensitive to light so that even the minutest amount of light causes excitement of the receptors. It takes about 7 minutes for the cones and 30 minutes for the rods for our eyes to adapt to darkness.",

Relative humidity is a measure of how much water vapour is in the air as a percentage of how much water vapour the air can hold in total. Warm air can hold more water vapour than colder air, therefore, for the same amount of water, the relative humidity in warm air is lower. This means that the lowest relative humidity in the cabin will occur when the cabin is warm. In the same way, to have the lowest relative humidity in the cabin, there has to be a small amount of water in the air. The way to do this is to have a cold outside air temperature, because that causes the outside air to hold less water in the first place. Especially if the arcraft was flying through a cloud, which has 100% relative humidity, there would be less water in the air if the air was colder. This means that we require a cold temperature outside to get the lowest relative humidity. This is a practical subject for human performance and limitations as humidity is often very low on aircraft, which causes dryness effects, that need to be counteracted sometimes.",

DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition caused by a rapid reduction in the ambient pressure surrounding the body. When decompression occurs, nitrogen and other inert gases that are normally dissolved in body tissue and fluid expand to form bubbles that rise out of the solution, in the same way that dissolved CO2 appears as bubbles when you uncap a bottle of soda. These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness. These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. Bends. Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

It is not the same as tar used on road surfaces. - Tar in cigarette smoke paralyzes the cilia in the lungs and contributes to lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer. However, it does not just affect your lungs, though. From there, the toxins can be carried into the bloodstream and begin moving to other parts of your body. Because smoke is drawn directly through the mouth, the tar can contribute to oral cancer as well. Toxins from tar can affect every organ in your body.

Hypoxia is painless, and the signs and symptoms vary from person to person. \"cabin will cool rapidly.\" Incorrect. It is not a rapid decompression, so the cabin will not cool rapidly. It could be cooling down slowly. \"cabin altitude will descend.\" Incorrect. Cabin altitude will increase on a decompression - it will tend to equalize the outside altitude.",

But did you know that exercise has both short and long term effects on the cardiovascular system? The cardiovascular system delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body, and consists of the heart and the blood vessels. Short Term Effects of Exercise on the Cardiovascular System Many short-term effects take place during physical activity, including: Faster heart contractions. This leads to an increased heart rate and increased circulation, which gets oxygenated blood to your muscles quicker. More forceful heart contractions with each heartbeat, which leads to a greater amount of blood being pumped throughout the body. Long Term Effects of Exercise on the Cardiovascular System A fairly well conditioned athlete can see long term cardiovascular effects from exercising in as little as two weeks. People who are just beginning to exercise will see effects in up to four weeks. These effects include: The heart and lungs become more efficient as your cardiovascular training increases. Decreased resting heart rate, which means your heart doesn’t have to beat as often to circulate blood. Improved ability to draw in deeper and longer breaths, and take fewer breaths. Reduced risk of heart disease. \"3. it reduces the human susceptibility to hypoxia.\" Correct. Regular exercise conditions the individual's body to increase the number of red blood cells, which improves the oxygenation of the body - resulting in a higher tolerance to altitude hypoxia.",

This effect is prevalent during high accelerations/deccelerations and it is the tendency – in the absence of visual references – to incorrectly perceive acceleration as an increase in pitch attitude and deceleration as a decrease in pitch attitude. This occurs because, for instance, during a sudden forward linear acceleration, the otoliths are moved backwards. This will give the signals to the brain that the head is tilting backwards. Thus the pilot feel that he/she is climbing. The pilot’s response to this illusion would be to push the yolk or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down.

This can result in misjudging both distance and altitude. Therefore, careful attention to airspeed, altitude, and aircraft positioning is imperative to avoid potential navigational and safety hazards when confronted with optical illusions. In this situation, in clear visibility conditions, the lack of haze can make objects appear closer than they actually are, leading to a risk of misjudging distance.

This blind spot is most problematic when vision from the other eye is partially or fully obscured, as that extra eye is usually what would fill in the blank section of vision, hence the reason we do not notice our blind spot in everyday life. If a pilot is looking in one direction with one eye obscured, there is a good chance that they would not see an aircraft on a constant relative bearing (stationary in the windshield) if it happens to lie within the blind spot of the working eye, meaning that the pilot may not be aware of the problem until it has come so close that its depiction is larger than the blind spot – which will most likely be too late to avoid a collision.

            "explanation": "NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS (NIHL) Sounds can be harmful when they are too loud, even for a brief time, or when they are both loud and long-lasting. These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes and particular frequencies, especially 4000Hz, as these notes are normally detected by the cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it. As for the other options, presbycusis is a natural hearing loss that occurs with ageing, conductive hearing loss is anything to do with the failure of the sound conduction within the ear (usually infection or wax build-up) and temporary hearing loss is the short-term precursor to NIHL.",

EASA distinguishes three physiological thresholds: Reaction threshold. The altitude of 7 000 ft is referred to as the reaction threshold. It is the altitude at which even a healthy person may start to experience symptoms of hypoxia. Above this limit, the body reacts to the decreasing oxygen supply by increasing the rate and depth of breathing as well as the stroke volume to ensure full performance. One of the first things to deteriorate is night vision, and that is what we have seen in this question. Disturbance threshold. The altitude band of 10 000 to 12 000 ft is called the disturbance threshold, because the compensatory mechanisms of the body are not powerful enough to ensure full operation. Performance will be reduced and flight safety may be impaired. Critical threshold. The altitude of 22 000 ft is referred to as the critical threshold. The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is reduced to equal the minimum required blood partial pressure, no diffusion of oxygen into the blood will be possible. Of course, the thresholds are for information only, and are not legal thresholds (but EASA do quote them exactly, like in this question). The effects of hypoxia can vary quite a lot from person to person, especially in smokers, who can begin to feel the disturbance threshold effects as low as 5 000 ft sometimes.",

            "explanation": "ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION The operator should issue instructions concerning the consumption of alcohol by crew members. The instructions should be not less restrictive than the following: (a) no alcohol should be consumed less than 8 hours prior to the specified reporting time for a flight duty period or the commencement of standby; (b) the blood alcohol level should not exceed the lower of the national requirements or 0.2 per thousand at the start of a flight duty period; (c) no alcohol should be consumed during the flight duty period or whilst on standby. The law states the maximum blood alcohol level for a pilot starting their duty, and the minimum length of time between alcohol consumption and reporting for duty. The pilot also has to be \"fit to fly\", which is unfortunately subjective, and depends on many factors, none of which are easy to determine. This subjectivity is the difficult part of this question. The pilot has been drinking 8 units a day for 2 weeks, and the assumed metabolic rate for removing alcohol from the body is 1 unit per hour. Going a bit deeper than the syllabus does, this 1 unit per hour does not start immediately, and it can differ wildly between people, or even between the same person on different days, depending on food, fluid consumption, sleep, and most importantly, alcohol level in the blood in the first place. The average maths say that the pilot should have metabolised the alcohol out of their system every day before their next session of drinking, but actually, there is a good chance that this would not be the case, especially if their drinking sessions last a few hours, and if their metabolic rate is slow. Even if they can metabolise the alcohol in time to start drinking the next day, there are certain mental effects (and physiological effects on the liver) that will carry over onto the next day, and become cumulative over time. If this were 2 or 3 days of drinking 8 units a day, it would not make too much difference. The problem is that 2 weeks is long enough to carry quite some cumulative effect, even if the blood alcohol level is down to zero before the flight (which will probably be the case, or very close to zero). There are often some mental effects that continue well after the last drop of alcohol is metabolised, which are numerous and include the \"hangover\", amongst other detrimental effects. It is one of the major flaws in the regulations above. This question is obviously still quite subjective, but the pilot can decide that they are unfit themselves (does not have to be an aeromedical examiner) and so declaring themselves unfit for duty is acceptable, even though many pilots would probably not even think about this factor, given the time that has elapsed since their last alcoholic drink. Note: This question is still a difficult one, and any further feedback on it would be very useful to validate the answer that we have from feedback. Any such exam feedback can be emailed to info@atplquestions.com or put in the comments, thank you.",

HYPOXIC HYPOXIA is a situation where the partial pressure of oxygen within the lungs is not sufficient to oxygenate the arterial blood and fulfil the metabolic demand. It can be caused by a reduced rate of breathing, a lower percetage of oxygen in the air, or, more commonly in aviation, by a decreasing total air pressure with corresponding reduction is oxygen partial pressure. HISTOTOXIC HYPOXIA, also known as cytotoxic hypoxia - happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. This may occur in the case of poisoning by toxic fumes or liquids during an accident. However, it is more commonly observed in aviation with passengers due to excessive intake of alcohol or drugs and self-medication. STAGNANT HYPOXIA, also known as Ischemic hypoxia, is a condition where certain body parts or organs are not adequately supplied with blood. Even if the blood is sufficiently oxygenated. The main reason for the occurence of this type of hypoxia, in aviation, is positive acceleration along the vertical axis of the body. This makes the blood pool in the legs and restricts blood flow to the brain. Heart insufficiency may also cause stagnat hypoxia by reducing bloof perfusion throughout the body.",

            "explanation": "Your sleeping period is primarily governed by your circadian rhythm - even if other factors (ie duration of previous sleep) may influence the duration of sleep. The body’s circadian rhythms control the sleep-wake cycle. They play a role in sleep due to how the body and brain respond to darkness, which is when most humans feel tired and tend to sleep. As darkness sets in, the body’s biological clock instructs the cells to slow down. When the evening becomes dark, the hormone melatonin starts to rise and allows sleep to occur. Melatonin peaks around 2–4 A. M. and then reduces by morning, allowing wakefulness. There is also a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

After passing through the pupil, the light passes through a clear lens. Its shape is changed by the muscles (ciliary muscles) surrounding it which allow the final focusing onto the fovea - In order to focus clearly on a near object, the lens is thickened. To focus on a distant point, the lens is flattened. This focused light is directed onto the retina, a thin layer of light-sensitive nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye. Images are focused at its center (known as the macula) and converted into electrical impulses that are carried to the brain by the optic nerve, where they are translated into sight.",

Two pathways come from the heart: The pulmonary circulation is a short loop from the heart to the lungs and back again. The systemic circulation carries blood from the heart to all the other parts of the body and back again. Deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a big artery that comes from the heart and brings blood from the heart to the lungs. At the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. The blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Next, blood that returns to the heart has picked up lots of oxygen from the lungs. So it can now go out to the body.

OUTER EAR The sound vibrations are entering the ear by the pinna, and then they travel through the auditory canal (Meatus) and finally reach the ear drum (Tympanium), which in turn vibrates. MIDDLE EAR Attached to the ear drum there are three tiny bones called ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes or hammer, anvil and stirrup). Their purpose is to act as a bridge and transfer the sound vibrations from the outer to the inner ear. Part of the middle ear is the Eustachian tube which is connected to the back of the throat and equalizes the pressure between the middle ear and the environment. INNER EAR Attached to the stapes there is the oval window, which causes the fluid inside the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. These hail-like cells movement depends on the frequency and loudness of the sound received. Their movement is detected by the auditory nerve and is transfered to the cortex of the brain, where it will be decoded into sound. Consequently, the part of the inner ear responsible for sound perception is the fluid-filled cochlea. There is another part of the inner ear called vestibular system, which is responsible for balance-acceleration detection.",

This temperature range is the same for all healthy individuals, provided that they are adapted to the climatic zone where they are. There is a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

Not all eyes form perfectly, and many people require some visual enhancement, such as in the cases of long-sightedness, short-sightedness and astigmatism: Long-sightedness (Hypermetropia). This is where the eyeball is slightly too short to correctly focus light on the retina at the back of the eye. Close-in objects become blurry, but far objects are much less effected. Spectacles have a converging lens to enhance the focusing effect of the cornea, fixing this. Short-sightedness (Myopia). The exact opposite, the eyeball is too long in this case, and far away objects are blurry, with closer objects less affected. Spectacles have diverging lens to reduce the focusing effect of the cornea, fixing this. Astigmatism. This is where the cornea is not spheroidal in shape, instead, it is not evenly shaped, and shapes can appear wrong. Cylindrical lenses can fix this, but surgery to the cornea can also be used to fix these abnormalities. The other option, presbyopia, is where the eyes become less elastic with aging, and become less able to accommodate, which becomes a weak form of long-sightedness, hence the need for many older people to use reading glasses.",

Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced.",

However, any movement of the head as a result of aircraft roll, pitch or yaw will cause the hairs in the fluid of the appropriate semi-circular canal(s) to move. Continued motion at a steady rate of turn will, after 10 - 15 seconds, allow the fluid to ‘catch up’ with the canal causing the hairs to revert to their upright position. This lack of vestibular input leads to a false perception that the aircraft is straight and level, when in fact it is not. Although the semicircular canals provide accurate information about angular movements of the head in the natural environment, difficulties arise when the speed of rotation is held steady for several seconds, or when the rate of turn increases or decreases at a steady rate (constant angular acceleration).",

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

You would not want to hide this pain, as it is much better to know about a pilot incapacitation ahead of time, to prepare and get medical help. Other symptoms of heart attack are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the centre or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint. You may also break out into a cold sweat. Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back. Shortness of breath. This often comes along with chest discomfort, but shortness of breath also can happen before chest discomfort.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

This is because the runway does not match previous experience. It is unfamiliar. In an attempt to make the narrower runway look normal, the pilot is likely to descend too early and too low. The approach appears to be too high, resulting in a low and flat approach and a late flare. A pilot approaching a wider runway is likely to feel too low due to the unfamiliarity of the scene.

Ozone (O3) is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms bonded together. It is a pale blue gas with a distinct, slightly sweet smell when present in low concentrations. Ozone plays a crucial role in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly in the ozone layer, which is a region of the stratosphere situated approximately 16 to 48 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Ozone is a highly toxic gas. In small amounts, it is an irritant to the lungs. Inhaling large amounts is deadly. Small ozone concentrations exist near the Earth's surface, in the troposphere. Ozone is a major component of smog and is formed through chemical reactions involving pollutants from various sources, including vehicle emissions and industrial processes. High concentrations of tropospheric ozone can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The ozone layer in the stratosphere is of utmost importance because it absorbs and filters out a significant portion of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Stratospheric ozone forms due to the action of ultraviolet light on oxygen. Ozone is most abundant at approximately 115,000 feet above sea level, with its concentration decreasing as altitude decreases. Below 40,000 feet, the presence of free ozone in the atmosphere is minimal or virtually nonexistent. Ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans. The higher the aircraft climbs, the higher the ozone exposure. Ozone quantities at modern cruising altitudes are not enough to cause any real harm, especially as most aircraft are fitted with ozone filters that will remove the majority of it from the cabin air. This allows us to bring the ozone concentration that is breathed in down below the prescribed limits.",

This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced.

The tympanum is connected to a chain of three small bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). The ossicles are parts of the middle ear which transmit sound vibrations through the middle ear (filled with air) to the inner ear (filled with fluid). The ossicles act as a bridge between the outer and the inner ear. The stapes, the last bone in the chain of the ossicles, is attached to the oval window, which is the beginning of the inner ear. In other words, the middle ear consists of the ossicles that connect the tympanum (outer ear) to the oval window (inner ear). The eustachian tube is a narrow tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat (pharynx). The primary function of the eustachian tube is to regulate the pressure in the middle ear. It does this by opening and closing to allow air to flow in and out of the middle ear. When we swallow, yawn, or chew, the muscles around the eustachian tube contract, which helps to open the tube and allow air to enter or exit the middle ear. This equalizes the pressure either side of the eardrum, between the middle ear and the environment. The eustachian tube is part of the middle ear and is responsible to equalize pressure either side of the eardrum, which is located between the outer and middle ear.",

PRESBYCUSIS Presbycusis is the loss of hearing that gradually occurs in most individuals as they grow older. The loss associated with presbycusis is usually greater for high-pitched sounds. For example, it may be difficult for someone to hear the nearby chirping of a bird or the ringing of a telephone. However, the same person may be able to hear clearly the low-pitched sound of a truck rumbling down the street. There are many causes of presbycusis. Most commonly it arises from changes in the inner ear of a person as he or she ages, but presbycusis can also result from changes in the middle ear or from complex changes along the nerve pathways leading to the brain. Presbycusis most often occurs in both ears, affecting them equally. Because the process of loss is gradual, people who have presbycusis may not realize that their hearing is diminishing.",

This temperature range is the same for all healthy individuals, provided that they are adapted to the climatic zone where they are. There is a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

Furthermore, it was reported in AGK of all subjects (we believe incorrectly), so we have placed it here, but do not know exactly where it may have come from. The normal glideslope angle should be flown to this runway. This will look different to normal (a flat runway on flat terrain), but can be judged by rate of descent and the relative movement of the visual picture if necessary, but a normal approach glideslope should be followed. The visual picture in this situation will make you think that you are too high, as both the upsloping terrain and runway make you think you are approaching the ground steeper than usual, when in fact the ground is rising to meet you. Your visual picture will feel \"too high\" on a normal glideslope, but that is what you must follow. The 15 degree offset is a silly idea as it provides further complication with no real benefit.",

If the autonomic nervous system (ANS) decides that the body needs more blood, due to any reason, then it will make the heart beat more frequently to increase the flow. There are a few main factors that increase the required blood flow, and therefore the heart rate: Adrenalin - the \"fight or flight\" response to stressors is extremely powerful in humans, and the corresponding response is an increase in heart rate - amongst other things - to be able to deal with the expected fighting, or running, etc. Physical exercise - the extra blood required to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells when the body is exercising means that the heart will have to work harder, with a higher heart rate. Obesity - The physical change in body size means that, the larger one's body becomes, the more pressure the blood will need to get around all the various blood vessels, requiring more pumping from the heart. There also can be some artery clogging which makes it harder for blood to flow, which can lead to heart attacks. High heat conditions - When in high heat conditions, the body needs to remove heat faster, by radiating it outwards from the skin. One of the best ways to do this is by sending more blood to the capillaries in the skin, which involved dilating (widening) the main arteries of the body. this decreases the blood pressure and therefore requires more beating from the heart to maintain an acceptable blood pressure. Dehydration - If you are dehydrated, the amount of blood circulating through your body decreases. Your heart will try to compensate by beating faster, increasing your heart rate. There are many more factors which affect the heart rate, and can even overpower the effects listed above sometimes.",

A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is higher than it actually is. If the pilot believes this illusion, they might pitch the aircraft’s nose down to lose altitude. Landing will also be hard in this case, because they will possibly flare late, expecting the runway to be larger in their windows, touching down with a large vertical speed. Furthermore, when approaching a runway with an upslope, the pilot views it at an increased angle, causing him to assume that he/she is higher above the runway than they actually are. The angle looks the same as being too high to a flat runway. The pilot might then increase their rate of descent and land short of the runway. As a result, the combination of a narrower runway with an upslope can easily make the pilot believe that they are actually high on approach. To correct this perception, they may descent too low, with the risk of landing short of the runway. Trusting their flight instruments should counteract this illusion.",

Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. As a recommendation, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.

The transparent part of the sclerotic is the cornea, behind which is the lens, whose purpose is to bend light rays inwards, to focus on the retina. The cornea is responsible for the greatest share of the total light refraction that occurs within the eye. The lens, iris and cornea control the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, which is the black bit inside the coloured iris. Generally, vision is better with more light, but too much will produce glare. 70% of light is refracted by the cornea, and 30% by the lens.",

If the autonomic nervous system (ANS) decides that the body needs more blood, due to any reason, then it will make the heart beat more frequently to increase the flow. There are a few main factors that increase the required blood flow, and therefore the heart rate: Adrenalin - the \"fight or flight\" response to stressors is extremely powerful in humans, and the corresponding response is an increase in heart rate - amongst other things - to be able to deal with the expected fighting, or running, etc. Physical exercise - the extra blood required to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells when the body is exercising means that the heart will have to work harder, with a higher heart rate. Obesity - The physical change in body size means that, the larger one's body becomes, the more pressure the blood will need to get around all the various blood vessels, requiring more pumping from the heart. There also can be some artery clogging which makes it harder for blood to flow, which can lead to heart attacks. High heat conditions - When in high heat conditions, the body needs to remove heat faster, by radiating it outwards from the skin. One of the best ways to do this is by sending more blood to the capillaries in the skin, which involved dilating (widening) the main arteries of the body. this decreases the blood pressure and therefore requires more beating from the heart to maintain an acceptable blood pressure. Dehydration - If you are dehydrated, the amount of blood circulating through your body decreases. Your heart will try to compensate by beating faster, increasing your heart rate. Stress - A stressful situation sets off a chain of events. Your body releases adrenaline which causes your breathing and heart rate to speed up. There are many more factors which affect the heart rate, and can even overpower the effects listed above sometimes.",

Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later. This means that an aircrew will experience a 29 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours, which means that the crew will suffer from 4 hours jet lag. Travelling Eastwards: New York – London London is 5 hours ahead of New York so noon occurs 5 hours earlier. This means that an aircrew will experience a 19 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours which means that the crew will suffer from 6 hours jet leg. => Jet Lag after travelling westwards is less than Eastwards. Travelling east causes more problems than travelling west. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so lengthening a day is less troublesome than shortening it.

TIME ZONE CROSSING Crossing time zones is a way of life for long-haul aircrew, and the time zone shifts can lead to a cumulative sleep deprivation. The shifting of zeitgebers (\"time givers\" - indicating the time of day to the body) will help to resynchronize to the new local time but it is a slow process, averaging a shift of about 90 minutes for each day in the new time zone. Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later. This means that an aircrew will experience a 29 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours, which means that the crew will suffer from 4 hours jet lag, and those 4 hours of jet lag will wear off quicker. Travelling Eastwards: New York – London London is 5 hours ahead of New York so noon occurs 5 hours earlier. This means that an aircrew will experience a 19 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours which means that the crew will suffer from 6 hours jet leg, and that jet lag will not wear off as quickly. => Jet Lag after travelling westwards is less than Eastwards. As we travel westwards, we will experience a lengthening in our day because the destination time will be behind us. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so \"lengthening\" a day is less troublesome than shortening it. This means that \"stretching the day\" by travelling West is better than going East.",

In this system the individual is given two points for every hour spent asleep and has one point deducted for every hour spent awake. This is only a rough measure, as individuals vary considerably in the amount of sleep they require. The maximum credit available is 16 points. You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. When a person is required to be awake longer than the credit situation allows, a sleep debit situation will develop. If possible, the following sleep cycle will then be longer than 8 hours to rebuild the full 16 hours of sleep credit. While a short sleep debit will usually not cause any remarkable effects in healthy persons, sleep debit can become cumulative and result in reduced vigilance and performance, with an increased susceptibility to sensory illusions. This problem is very common when forced to work days (or nights) in a row with little time in between that to be used for building up sleep credit. Jet lag/circadian disrhythmia - occurs when conducting transmeridian long-distance flights where shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. Most likely, this question does not refer to long-haul flights but rather short-haul operations, where the crew always returns to base and no shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. The question possibly describes a situation of situational insomnia (inability to sleep due to disrupted work/rest patterns, or circadian dysrhythmia) rather than chronic insomnia (long-term pattern of difficulty sleeping).",

In the cockpit, high-quality sunglasses are a necessity to enhance visual performance. They mitigate the impact of intense sunlight, alleviate eye fatigue, and shield the eyes from detrimental solar radiation. Additionally, sunglasses assist in the adjustment to darkness, which can be impeded by extended exposure to bright sunlight. Use of sunglasses prevents: long-term damage to the retina cataracts damage to the delicate tissues around the eyes potential eye strain and fatigue caused by glare POLARIZATION. Polarized lenses are not recommended for use in the aviation environment. While useful for blocking reflected light from horizontal surfaces such as water or snow, polarization can reduce or eliminate the visibility of instruments that incorporate antiglare filters. Note: Glaucoma is related to increased pressure within the eye and is not proven to be prevented by the use of sunglasses. Presbyopia is an age-related issue.",

Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. It can stem from different factors. Social factors can contribute to a person’s views of drinking. Your culture, religion, family and work influence many of your behaviors, including drinking. Family plays the biggest role in a person’s likelihood of developing alcoholism. Children who are exposed to alcohol abuse from an early age are more at risk of falling into a dangerous drinking pattern. Researchers have examined whether or not a person’s proximity to alcohol retail stores or bars affect their chances of alcoholism. People who live closer to alcohol establishments are said to have a more positive outlook on drinking and are more likely to participate in the activity. Different psychological factors may increase the chances of heavy drinking. Every person handles situations in their own unique way. However, how you cope with these feelings can impact certain behavioral traits. For example, people with high stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions are more vulnerable to developing alcoholism. In these types of circumstances, alcohol is often used to suppress feelings and relieve the symptoms of psychological disorders.",

The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude.

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

It manifests itself in progressive narrowing of the coronary arteries by plaque, deposits of fat, thrombi and calcification of the walls. An effective method to reduce the chances of developing coronary artery disease is to eliminate risk factors. For instance, quitting smoking is considered the most effective step and the consumption of alcohol should be kept to a minimum. Another powerful measure is to reach and maintain a healthy body weight. This should be achieved by a good diet and physical activity. One of the benefits of exercise is the economisation of the cardiovascular activity. A strong heart can pump more blood around your body with less effort. Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy. To be effective in reducing coronary artery disease, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.",

Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later. This means that an aircrew will experience a 29 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours, which means that the crew will suffer from 4 hours jet lag. Travelling Eastwards: New York – London London is 5 hours ahead of New York so noon occurs 5 hours earlier. This means that an aircrew will experience a 19 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours which means that the crew will suffer from 6 hours jet leg. => Jet Lag after travelling westwards is less than Eastwards. Travelling east causes more problems than travelling west. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so lengthening a day is less troublesome than shortening it.",

Breathing rates lower than 12 breaths per minute may indicate hypoventilation, where the body is not taking in enough oxygen or expelling enough carbon dioxide.

            "explanation": "GLAUCOMA Glaucoma is a disease of the eye which causes a pressure rise of the liquid around the eye. The fluid protects the lens and nourishes the cornea. It passes through a small shutter which can either be flawed or can become jammed causing a rise in pressure of the eye. There are two main kinds of Glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

The humidity of the air in pressurized aircraft is typically only 5 to 15 %. Such difference results from the air conditioning system of modern aircraft drawing air from outside the aircraft - At airline operating altitudes, the air is very cold and can only hold very little amount of water vapour. Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. It is paramount that a person compensates for this very low humidity by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration - thrist is a late symptom of dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration may include headache, feeling dizzy or lightheaded and muscle cramps. Remember that even slight dehydration can cause a reduction in performance. It is also important to recall that caffeine and alcoholic beverages actually contribute to dehydration. Dry air may cause irritation of the eyes especially if contact lenses are worn and these may have to be removed.",

From the aavailable options, the following factors can contribute to anemia: 1. Iron deficit: Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A deficiency in iron is one of the most common causes of anemia, known as iron-deficiency anemia. Without adequate iron, the body cannot produce enough healthy red blood cells. 2. Malaria: Malaria is a parasitic infection that destroys red blood cells. The parasite Plasmodium, which causes malaria, infects red blood cells and causes them to rupture. This destruction of red blood cells leads to anemia. 4. Smoking: Smoking can contribute to anemia by causing chronic inflammation and reducing the absorption of nutrients essential for red blood cell production, such as iron and folate. Additionally, the carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke binds to hemoglobin more readily than oxygen, which can reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. The incorrect option is: 3. Potassium deficit: Potassium is an essential mineral for various bodily functions, including maintaining proper muscle function and heart rhythm. However, a deficiency in potassium does not directly cause anemia.",

However, the same person may be able to hear clearly the low-pitched sound of a truck rumbling down the street. There are many causes of presbycusis. Most commonly it arises from changes in the inner ear of a person as he or she ages, but presbycusis can also result from changes in the middle ear or from complex changes along the nerve pathways leading to the brain. Presbycusis most often occurs in both ears, affecting them equally. Because the process of loss is gradual, people who have presbycusis may not realize that their hearing is diminishing",

They also act as a lubricating medium, thereby reducing the friction between moving parts and carrying away some of the heat. Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. In aviation, mainly mineral or synthetic based oil are used: DTD 585: a refined mineral based oil. Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system and maintain the seals according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Ideal properties of a hydraulic fluid: Low compressibility: to ensure instantaneous operation; Good lubrication and anti-corrision properties: hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system; High flash point and low flammability: fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components; Low volatility: be resistant to evaporation; Adequate viscosity: the fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures. The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability.",

It is produced by incomplete combustion processes, such as smouldering fires or cigarette smoking. A certain amount of carbon monoxide is also generated in the operation of a combustion engine. When using engine exhaust for heating purposes, carbon monoxide may enter the aircraft cabin. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like\".",

As we travel westwards, we will experience a lengthening in our day because the destination time will be behind us.

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning.

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

The upper value signifies the systolic pressure, representing the pressure produced by the heart when it contracts to circulate blood throughout the body. The lower value is the diastolic pressure, denoting the constant pressure within the arterial system. These pressures are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The normal range of blood pressure fluctuates with age, but a young and fit adult usually exhibits a systolic pressure of around 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of about 80 mm Hg (120/80). Hypertension or high blood pressure is blood pressure of 140/95 or higher. Hypertension can be a factor in cardiovascular failure and it might be caused due to stress, age, obesity, narrowing of the arteries or lack of exercise. Hypotension or low blood pressure typically doesn't pose a significant threat. Nonetheless, if the pressure diminishes excessively, resulting in insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues, it can give rise to various symptoms. Hypotension is generally diagnosed when systolic pressure falls below 90 mm Hg or diastolic pressure falls below 60 mm Hg (90/60). The systolic pressure of 160 is very high. The diastolic pressure of 95 is hypertension starting point. As a result, the recorded combination of 160/95 is classified as hypertension.",

Preventive measures include: Learning that sensory illusions (visual and vestibular) are common inflight occurrences that represent normal human responses to unusual sensor stimulations. Pilots should also learn to not trust their sensory perceptions under various circumstances that promote illusions, and to avoid sudden intuitive control manipulations based on these innacurate orientational perceptions. Understanding the nature of various illusions and their contributing factors to be aware of inflight conditions that are likely to promote the occurrence of such illusions. Learn to utilize and rely on orientational information available from non-sensory sources such as attitude instrument displays, radar, radar altimeter, navigation instrumentation, visual glideslope aids and other instruments.

On average, this focus point is typically between just under 1 meter and 1.5 meters, although individual variations exist. This has important implications when searching for distant targets in situations with weak visual cues because the eye is not naturally adjusted for that purpose. The presence of nearby objects, such as rain spots on the windscreen, can exacerbate this issue as the eye is naturally drawn to them. This phenomenon can occur in various conditions, including cloudless skies at high altitudes, total darkness, uniformly overcast skies, featureless terrain, large bodies of water or during relaxation. Searching out and focusing on distant points, such as the tip of the wing, or scanning the sky with the use of peripheral vision to detect and focus on other distant aircraft, help prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.",

Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible.

The amount of cosmic radiation you are exposed to while flying depends on four factors: altitude, latitude, and solar activity (normal and random solar activity). The fourth factor is the duration of the flight. In general, the higher the altitude and latitude and the longer the flight, the greater the radiation exposure. It is important to point that the effects of radiation are cumulative, increasing with exposure time. The Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic shield protect us from cosmic radiation. Earth’s magnetic shield protects us from the cosmic radiation and is strongest at the equator and weakest near the poles. People who live at higher latitudes are exposed to slightly more cosmic radiation than people who live at lower latitudes. At higher altitudes, people are also exposed to more radiation. The main reason is that there is less atmosphere between us and the cosmic rays. Solar events can raise radiation levels. Solar events include solar flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as other events. Solar flares are when sunspots interact with one another and cause an explosion on the Sun’s surface.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected.

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter.

During descent the danger is higher, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

This can cause the pilot to incorrectly perceive the aircraft’s bank angle or attitude. The 'leans' can occur under two common circumstances in flight: Wings level after a gentle slow turn: If a pilot begins a very gentle and slow turn where the movement of the inner ear's liquid is too slight to activate the hair cells. Consequently, although the aircraft is turning, the balance mechanism senses no change. When the pilot returns to straight and level flight afterward, the inner ear perceives this as a turn from straight and level flight. The pilot may feel as if the aircraft is still turning, even though it is actually straight and level. Wings level after a prolonged turn: During a prolonged turn where the aircraft remains in a banked position long enough for the hair cells in the inner ear canals to fully erect. Upon rolling out of the turn, the movement of the hair cells gives a false sensation of turning in the opposite direction, despite the aircraft being level in reality. In both scenarios described above, the pilot experiences conflicting signals: visually, they perceive the aircraft as level, while their vestibular system indicates a turning sensation. This discrepancy between what is seen and what is felt can lead to spatial disorientation and challenges in accurately perceiving the aircraft's actual orientation in flight.

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

The vestibular system (in the inner ear): The vestibular system (inner ear) consists of the otoliths that sense linear acceleration and gravity, and the semi-circular canals that sense angular acceleration of the head. It provides information about the direction and speed of head movements, helping the brain understand the new orientation of the body and maintain spatial orientation. The proprioceptive system: The proprioceptive system uses sensory receptors located in muscles, tendons, and joints that detect changes in muscle length, tension, and joint angle. It provides information about the position and movement of body parts relative to each other and the surrounding environment, and helps maintain spatial orientation.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

For starters, none of these organs can detect speed. They detect accelerations only; some angular and some linear. The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear accelerations along every axis of the body. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation, as a linear acceleration The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis. Therefore, the vestibular system can sense linear accelerations of the body along all 3 axes using the utricle and saccule, and can sense angular accelerations of the body around all 3 axes using the semicircular canals.",

Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flyinga non-pressurized aircraft above 10 000 ft without supplemental oxygen, when experiencing a rapid decompression during flight, a pressurization system malfunction, or oxygen system malfunction. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body.",

While tar and carbon monoxide are harmful components of tobacco smoke that can have severe health consequences, they are not primarily responsible for its addictive nature. Nicotine is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. When nicotine binds to these receptors, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which leads to feelings of pleasure and reward. This reinforcement of positive feelings can create a strong psychological dependence on nicotine. Nicotine is also physically addictive. Regular use of nicotine leads to the development of tolerance, meaning that over time, individuals need to consume more nicotine to achieve the same effects. Additionally, when someone tries to quit using nicotine, they often experience withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, and anxiety, which can make it challenging to quit.",

On the 25th of October 1999, a SunJet Aviation Learjet 35 crashed in South Dakota, after 4 hour ghost flight through US airspace. This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for heart diseases and stroke. Hypertension adds to your heart's workload and damages your arteries and organs over time. Hypertension puts your arteries under constant unnecessary stress, and the same as with a tyre that's been overpumped, too much force inside your blood vessels damages the artery walls and makes them weaker. The build up of various fatty deposits within the arteries is accelerated with high blood pressure, which can break off and cause risk of clogging blood vessels. Left undetected (or uncontrolled), high blood pressure can lead to: Heart attack — High blood pressure damages arteries that can become blocked and prevent blood flow to the heart muscle. Stroke — High blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the brain to clog more easily or even burst. A stroke is a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain, so is primarily caused by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain.",

Difficulty in controlling drinking behavior: Challenges in limiting the onset, termination, or levels of alcohol use once drinking has begun. Physiological withdrawal state: Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not consuming alcohol, or drinking to avoid these symptoms. Tolerance: Needing increasingly larger amounts of alcohol to achieve the same effects that were once reached with smaller quantities. Neglect of other interests and responsibilities: Prioritizing alcohol use over other activities and responsibilities, resulting in neglect of social, occupational, or recreational activities. Continued use despite harmful consequences: Persisting in drinking alcohol even though it is causing or exacerbating physical, mental, or social problems. Alcoholism involves a complex interaction of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors, making it a multifaceted issue that often requires comprehensive treatment approaches. Let's examine the options provided: A middle-aged man in a highly regarded job. He will drive great distances at any time to buy a bottle of whiskey and revert to alternatives when his brand is not available. → Strong desire or compulsion to drink. His tolerance towards alcohol has increased over the years, along with the average amount he drinks. → Tolerance. He laughs off concerns voiced about health effects of his alcohol consumption. → Continued use despite harmful consequences. A young woman has always been drinking moderate amounts of alcohol. She decides to drink half a glass of champagne on a New Year’s Eve party, despite the warnings of two friends partying with her that alcohol could have adverse effects on her baby. → Does not show signs of dependence, tolerance, or preoccupation with alcohol. Her behavior is more about a one-time decision rather than a pattern of misuse. A teenager regularly drinks great amounts of alcohol in company of peers about twice a month. He has been hospitalised with alcohol intoxication previously, and his closer friends regularly keep an eye on his consumption once he has passed a certain threshold. → While there is dangerous behavior, the key signs of dependence such as increased tolerance over long periods, and neglect of responsibilities are not clearly indicated. A widow woman drinks a glass of wine almost every evening. When there is no wine left in her apartment, she reverts to eating great amounts of chocolate. → No evidence of increased tolerance or prioritizing alcohol.",

Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control. Body feedback will be wrong and only by reference to the aircraft instruments can safe control of the aircraft be maintained.",

Your body has its own internal clock (circadian rhythms) that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep. Under normal circumstances, a person’s circadian rhythm aligns with daylight, promoting alertness during the day and sleep at night. This internal clock synchronizes with the 24-hour day to promote quality sleep as well as physical and mental health. A person’s geographic location affects their circadian rhythm since sunrise and sunset occur at different times in different locations. Jet lag may be experienced because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've traveled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag. Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems. One may also experience sleeping problems - It may be hard to fall asleep when you want to, or you may wake up earlier than planned. Jet lag can also cause sleep to be fragmented. It is a temporary disorder. For example, if you fly from Los Angeles to New York and arrive at 8 p.m., your body might still operate as if it’s in L. A. at 5 p.m. This jet lag can cause you to stay up later than you’d like, sleep at odd hours, or feel more tired than usual, among other symptoms.",

They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

            "explanation": "The auditory system is comprised of three components; the outer, middle, and inner ear, all of which work together to transfer sounds from the environment to the brain. THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate. THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid. Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns.",

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. It can stem from different factors. Social factors can contribute to a person’s views of drinking. Your culture, religion, family and work influence many of your behaviors, including drinking. Family plays the biggest role in a person’s likelihood of developing alcoholism. Children who are exposed to alcohol abuse from an early age are more at risk of falling into a dangerous drinking pattern. Researchers have examined whether or not a person’s proximity to alcohol retail stores or bars affect their chances of alcoholism. People who live closer to alcohol establishments are said to have a more positive outlook on drinking and are more likely to participate in the activity. Different psychological factors may increase the chances of heavy drinking. Every person handles situations in their own unique way. However, how you cope with these feelings can impact certain behavioral traits. For example, people with high stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions are more vulnerable to developing alcoholism. In these types of circumstances, alcohol is often used to suppress feelings and relieve the symptoms of psychological disorders. Abundant evidence indicates that alcoholism is a complex genetic disease, with variations in a large number of genes affecting risk. Some of these genes have been identified, including two genes of alcohol metabolism, ADH1B and ALDH2, that have the strongest known affects on risk for alcoholism. Studies are revealing other genes in which variants impact risk for alcoholism or related traits.",

RESPIRATION Our body's cells need to create energy to power their normal processes. This energy comes from a process called respiration, and is split into two parts. The process of internal respiration is where our blood capillaries pass fresh oxygen (O2) to the cells that require it to create energy. It is also where the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) transfers from our cells to the blood capillaries, as it is a waste product of the energy creation process. The blood is used to transfer the oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the bodies, between the lungs and the cells and back again. External respiration is the name of a process by the lungs, where fresh oxygen diffuses into the capillaries of the bloodstream from the alveoli in the lungs. The opposite process also occurs in the same place, where carbon dioxide diffuses from the bloodstream to the air in the lungs. Alveoli are small sponge like sacks that allow a large transfer of fresh oxygen (O2) and waste carbon dioxide (CO2), they have extremely high surface areas for maximum exchange of useful and waste gases.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

A narrower than usual runway can create an illusion the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is, especially when runway length-to-width relationships are comparable. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach with the risk of striking objects along the approach path or landing short. A wider than usual runway can create an illusion the aircraft is lower than it actually is, leading to a higher approach. Summary: When flying into a runway that is wider than you are used to, you’re prone to thinking you are lower than you actually are. When there is so much runway filling your perifiery, you assume you’re just about to touch down. This causes pilots to flare too high.",

            "explanation": "The auditory system is comprised of three components; the outer, middle, and inner ear, all of which work together to transfer sounds from the environment to the brain. THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate (1). THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid (2). Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns (3).",

The CNS is also responsible for higher-order functions such as cognition, memory, decision-making, and consciousness. 2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): The PNS connects the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body, including the limbs and organs by a vast network of nerves. It serves as a communication network between the CNS and the body's sensory receptors, muscles, and glands. The PNS has two main divisions: the sensory (afferent) division, which transmits sensory information from the body to the CNS, and the motor (efferent) division, which transmits commands from the CNS to muscles and glands. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): The ANS is a subpart of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and is responsible for regulating involuntary bodily functions and maintaining homeostasis. It controls various internal organs and processes such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The ANS has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system (which prepares the body for \"fight or flight\" responses) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which promotes \"rest and digest\" functions).",

Efficiency focuses on maximizing output and minimizing waste, often emphasizing cost reduction and speed of operations. While efficiency is important, it should not come at the expense of safety.

Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

At the end of a briefing, all crew members should share a common mental model of the situation. Briefings can be a powerful means of transferring information; if properly given they can be extremely effective.",

Crew Resource Management (CRM): CRM principles emphasize effective teamwork and communication within the cockpit. By involving all members in the discussion. Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued.

            "explanation": "SHELL MODEL The SHELL Model is a conceptual tool used to analyze the interaction of multiple system components and identify vulnerable spots. The SHELL Model contains the following four components: Liveware (L). At the centre of the model is the pilot. Man - the most valuable and flexible component of the system. The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

If the risk is considered to be unacceptable, then control measures are taken to fortify and increase the level of defences against that risk or to avoid or remove the risk, if this is economically feasible. Look at take-off performance for instance. Of course, it would be safer to impose a rule that every runway needs to be 2x longer than the TODR, but it is going to be extremely expensive to build up to 6000 m runways. And even then, it would be safer still to be 3x the TODR, or even safer, 4x the TODR. You can see where this is going. We have to draw the line somewhere, with an \"acceptable\" risk level. This is obviously incredibly low, and the industry should always attempt to lower it further, but there will never be NO risk.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Such complexities would include, for example, dealing with adverse meteorological conditions, airports surrounded by high mountains, congested airspace, aircraft malfunctions, errors committed by other people outside of the cockpit, such as air traffic controllers, flight attendants or maintenance workers, and so forth. The TEM model considers these complexities as threats because they all have the potential to negatively affect flight operations by reducing margins of safety; (.) (vii) Table 1 presents examples of threats, grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM Model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organisational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (for example removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organisations. Organisational threats are usually latent in nature. Flight crews still remain the last line of defence, but there are earlier opportunities for these threats to be mitigated by aviation organisations themselves. Environmental threats Organisational threats (A) weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross or tailwind, very low or high temperatures; (B) ATC: traffic congestion, ACAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication or units of measurement (QFE/meters); (C) airport: contaminated or short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of, confusing, faded signage, markings, birds, aids unserviceable, complex surface navigation procedures or airport constructions; (D) terrain: high ground, slope, lack of references or ‘black hole’; (E) other: similar call-signs. (A)operational pressure: delays, late arrivals or equipment changes; (B) aircraft: aircraft malfunction, automation event or anomaly, MEL/CDL; (C) cabin: flight attendant error, cabin event distraction, interruption, cabin door security; (D) maintenance: maintenance event or error; (E) ground: ground-handling event, de-icing or ground crew error; (F) dispatch: dispatch paperwork event or error; (G) documentation: manual error or chart error; (H) other: crew scheduling event.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

            "explanation": "The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. It is based on three components, threats, errors and undesired aircraft states. Threats are the first line of defence, and are times or places where a potential error could be made quite easily. They can be classed as latent threats, environmental threats, or organisational threats, depending on how the threat has occurred in the first place. Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occurred to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations We would consider this scenario a threat - because actually, no errors have yet occurred, all procedures have been followed and it is not going to cause a problem at this stage. The problem is that if the pilot monitoring now has a different mental model to the pilot flying, an error could be induced sometime after, which could be due to a huge number of factors. For example, if the pilot monitoring were to set up the approach shortly after by changing some items on the automation, but does not realise that a particular mode is active, they could change the aircraft course, altitude or speed accidentally. That would be an error, quickly leading to an undesired aircraft state. Whilst we classify errors as procedural, aircraft handling and communication, threats can either be latent, environmental or organisational, but this examiner has also classified the communication threats (as if it were a communication error, but only at the level of threat) as such, which we do not fully agree with. The problem is that we don't agree with any of the other options, as we think neither pilot made an error, so we are choosing the best of a bad bunch. Unfortunately, it is not rare for EASA to make a question with bad options like this one, so we think the feedback could easily be fully correct.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

            "explanation": "The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. It is based on three components, threats, errors and undersired aircraft states. Threats are the first line of defense, and are times or places where a potential error could be made qute easily. They can be classed as latent threats, environmental threats, or organisational threats, depending on how the threat has occured in the first place. Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occured to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations. There are some counter-measures that can be put in place to aid Threat and Error Management, probably the largest of which is the set of systemic counter-measures that are put in place by all operators. These are parts of the system that have been created or develoed specificaly to aid TEM and safety procedure. They can be things like: Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS/TCAS) Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) TEM training (CRM training also) Briefings Checklists These all promote and help TEM as they provide the flight crew with more opportunities to notice threats, errors and undesired aircraft states, as well as good tools to mitigate any such errors, and get out of the undesired states.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Threats can be grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organizational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (i.e., removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organizations. Organizational threats are usually latent in nature. Table 1. Examples of threats (List not inclusive) Environmental Threats Organizational Threats Weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross/tailwind, very low/high temperatures. ATC: traffic congestion, TCAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication, units of measurement (QFE/meters). Airport: contaminated/short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of/confusing/faded signage/markings, birds, aids U/S, complex surface navigation procedures, airport constructions. Terrain: High ground, slope, lack of references, “black hole”. Other: similar call-signs. Operational pressure: delays, late arrivals, equipment changes. Aircraft: aircraft malfunction, automation event/anomaly, MEL/CDL. Cabin: flight attendant error, cabin event distraction, interruption, cabin door security. Maintenance: maintenance event/error. Ground: ground handling event, de-icing, ground crew error. Dispatch: dispatch paperwork event/error. Documentation: manual error, chart error. Other: crew scheduling event",

An informed culture is highly effective in risk management, as it involves the collection, analysis, and active dissemination of relevant data and safety information. By doing so, this culture provides a wealth of data to better manage and mitigate future risks. Reporting culture. An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Individuals feel encouraged and supported to report any safety-related issues without fear of punishment or reprisal. The focus is on learning from mistakes and using reported data to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and implement improvements to prevent future incidents. Learning culture. An organization must demonstrate both the willingness and the capability to draw appropriate conclusions from its safety information system. Moreover, it should also show a strong determination to implement significant reforms based on those conclusions. Just culture. In a conducive atmosphere, unintentional errors and unsafe acts are not subjected to punishment. However, individuals who exhibit recklessness or willingly take unjustifiable risks remain liable for disciplinary action. Flexible culture. In this culture, organizations can adapt to high-tempo operations or specific types of danger, often transitioning from a traditional hierarchical structure to a more flexible and flattened mode.",

Open Culture: Open culture refers to an organizational environment characterized by transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. In an open culture, there is an emphasis on communication and information sharing, where employees feel empowered to express their opinions, ideas, and concerns freely without fear of reprisal. Decision-making processes are often participatory, and feedback is actively sought and welcomed. Open cultures foster trust among team members and promote innovation, as individuals feel encouraged to challenge the status quo and explore new ways of doing things. 2. Closed Culture: Closed culture describes an organizational environment characterized by secrecy, hierarchy, and limited communication. In a closed culture, information is often tightly controlled, and decisions are made by a select few individuals at the top of the hierarchy, without input from lower-level employees. There is a lack of transparency and trust, which can lead to a culture of suspicion and resentment among team members. Innovation and creativity are stifled in closed cultures, as individuals may feel discouraged from speaking up or taking risks.",

The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

            "explanation": "OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE Oxygen forms 21% of the total air in the atmosphere. The partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere is therefore 21% of the total atmospheric pressure (Dalton's law). This gives an oxygen partial pressure of 160 mmHg at MSL. The total atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude and so does the partial pressure of oxygen. In the human lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases further (14%) due to the presence of the breathing waste products (carbon dioxide and water vapor). The required oxygen partial pressure for the human lungs to work properly is 55 mmHg. A reduction of the oxygen partial pressure below that value can lead to hypoxia. An oxygen partial pressure of 55 mmHg occurs at 10 000 ft. This means that above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should be increased. Above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should start increasing. At 33 700 ft the oxygen should become 100% of the cabin air in order to be equivalent to breathing air at MSL. At 40 000 ft breathing 100% oxygen is equivalent to breathing ambient air at 10 000 ft. Above 40 000 ft 100% oxygen under positive pressure should be provided. Based on exam feedback the correct answer is '32 000 ft'. Please provide any further feedback available in the comments.",

Every individual involved in operations has to support the safety culture, the duty of the \"higher levels\" of management is to ensure that all required resources are available. Dr James Reason has suggested that safety culture consists of five elements: An informed culture A reporting culture A learning culture A just culture A flexible culture Informed culture. The organization collects and analyses relevant data, and actively disseminates safety information. Reporting culture. An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Learning culture. An organization must possess the willingness and the competence to draw the right conclusions from its safety information system and the will to implement major reforms. Just culture. An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture. A culture in which an organisation is able to reconfigure themselves in the face of high tempo operations or certain kinds of danger – often shifting from conventional hierarchical mode to a flatter mode.",

Different crew members may interpret the information differently, and discussing it helps align their perceptions. Crew Resource Management (CRM): CRM principles emphasize effective teamwork and communication within the cockpit. By involving all members in the discussion. Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued. It empowers co-pilots, including the young and less experienced one, to voice concerns, ask questions, and contribute to the safety of the flight.",

However, a student has confirmed on the comments section of question 813331 that it appeared in their HPL exam. If you do come across this question in HPL, please make sure that you appeal it. The pallet of freight being placed in the forward hold, instead of where it was supposed to be placed (the aft hold) means that the aircraft's CG is actually further forward than the pilots are aware of. The location of an aircraft's CG is an important factor for many things, both for stability and control as well as for the aircraft's performance. When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce. For every bit of lift the wing produces though, there is some induced drag that occurs, which means that further forward CG locations cause higher drag, and therefore lower climb performance, shorter aircraft range, and generally worse efficiency. It is possible that the forward CG would have an effect on yaw, due to the slightly longer moment arm of the fin and rudder, but the effect would be incredibly small, particularly when compared to the other effects it causes.",

We agree with the current feedback that visual warnings disrupt the crew's workflow. This is true because visual warnings draw the eye to them, which takes it off the task at hand, and means the brain now has to process whatever the warning is showing, rather than what it was doing before the warning occured. This is most often intentional on the part of the cockpit designer, as some warnings are important enough to need the pilots attention over the current task. Visual warnings are also useful as they can also stay on without causing too much annoyance, as an aural warning might. To cover the other options, we would not say that visual warnings are \"more ergonomic\" than aural warnings. This is mainly because aural warnings can be processed by the pilot alongside their current task without having to divert the gaze. We would say that visual warnings have a variable effect on situational awareness. They improve awareness of whatever they are indicating, but not as well as aural warnings, and can draw the pilot's attention from the other parts of situational awareness. Therefore, that answer is not fully correct. Aural warnings allow for simultaneous processing of information (somewhat - but not fully, there is still some distraction), but this is not the case for visual warnings.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Threats can be grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time.

Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Threats can be grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organizational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (i.e., removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organizations. Organizational threats are usually latent in nature. Table 1.

Fatigue is a major human factors hazard because it affects most aspects of a crewmember’s ability to do their job. It therefore has implications for safety. ICAO defines a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as: A data-driven means of continuously monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety risks, based upon scientific principles and knowledge as well as operational experience that aims to ensure relevant personnel are performing at adequate levels of alertness. An FRMS aims to ensure that flight and cabin crew members are sufficiently alert so they can operate to a satisfactory level of performance. It is a set of guidelines aimed at reducing fatigue-induced safety risks and considers additional factors such as the circadian rhythm, the importance of adequate sleep within the rest period, and the unique properties of the individual operation. FRMS is based on computer models which anticipate the expected performance capability of a person from his/her sleep/awake history. Such models must be continuously updated by analyses of data and reports. The quality of the FRMS depends on its ability to learn. The term used for this kind of safety culture is “learning culture”. It is also dependent on the willingness of aircrew to report fatigue-related issues and in a culture where crew members are encouraged to report safety risks. However, such safety cultured is named “just culture” and not “non-punitive culture”.",

Over the past several years, many studies have been conducted on the influence of national culture in the workplace. These studies focused on a number of dimensions, but primarily sought to answer whether people will first act in the interest of what their national culture expects of them, or first act in the interest of maintaining a safe work environment. In this case, it is pretty clear that national culture is taking precedence over safety culture.",

This model categorizes errors based on how the pilot or flight crew is involved when the error occurs. Errors are subdivided into aircraft handling, procedural and communication errors. To be considered an aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be actively engaged with the aircraft, such as its controls, automation, or systems. Procedural errors are classified when the pilot or flight crew make mistakes while following procedures, such as checklists or standard operating procedures (SOPs). Communication errors are categorized when the pilot or flight crew make mistakes during interactions with people, such as air traffic control (ATC), ground crew, or other crew members. Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation The aircraft executes a wrong automation mode while the commander is occupied correcting the speed and rate of descent.

It involves recognizing threats, errors, and undesired aircraft states to prevent accidents or incidents. In the context of preventing a runway excursion after touchdown, it is imperative for flight crews to consistently maintain a stabilized approach during the final phases of landing. This entails strict adherence to predetermined criteria governing airspeed, descent rate, and runway alignment. In the event that an approach becomes destabilized, thereby elevating the risk of a runway excursion, it is incumbent upon pilots to promptly implement corrective measures to restore stability before the landing occurs. This ensures a safe and controlled touchdown and subsequent rollout on the runway. If the approach is not stable by 1 000 feet AGL or 500 feet AGL (depending on weather conditions), or if the approach becomes unstable below these altitudes, the pilot should initiate a missed approach/go around.",

After approximately 15 to 30 seconds of constant angular acceleration, such as what occurs during a steady turn, the vestibular system stabilizes to the angular velocity and the pilot may have the illusion that rotation has ceased. The leans/somatogyral illusion occur when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. If you make such a recovery, your semicircular canals sense a roll in the opposite direction. This may cause you to reenter the original attitude. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans.",

Left undetected (or uncontrolled), high blood pressure can lead to: Heart attack — High blood pressure damages arteries that can become blocked and prevent blood flow to the heart muscle. Stroke — High blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the brain to clog more easily or even burst. Kidney Damage — The increased pressure in the blood vessels can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, which play a crucial role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.

Size constancy relates to the expectations a pilot has on final approach in regards to the size of the runway in front of him: deviations from the familiar runway size, especially in combination with a lack of other objects of known size such as tress or buildings nearby, can cause them to misjudge the remaining distance along the glide path.

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

            "explanation": "\"He/she may experience a black hole illusion, so he/she needs to rely on his/her instruments.\" Incorrect. The \"black hole\" effect often leads pilots to fly a lower final approach than intended. It's worth noting that the black hole effect typically occurs during nighttime landings in dark conditions devoid of starlight or moonlight. Given the clear, blue sky and absence of clouds in the scenario described, it's unlikely to be attributed to the black hole effect. \"He/she feels like being too high, which may result in a short landing.\" Correct. The scenario described in the question entails a pilot making an approach over water toward a runway perpendicular to the shoreline. With a clear blue sky, discerning between the water and the sky becomes challenging. The Featureless Terrain Illusion occurs when noticeable ground features are absent, such as during overwater approaches, in snow-covered areas, or over darkened terrains. This phenomenon can create the false impression that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. Consequently, a pilot might descend prematurely, potentially resulting in a landing short of the runway. Note: This question was recently updated following recent feedback.

Initially, the hearing loss caused by loud noises may be temporary, but continued exposure to sounds louder than 85 decibels (dB) will lead to permanent hearing impairment. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. One of the initial signs is difficulty in perceiving high-pitched tones, as these notes are typically detected by the more delicate cells that are most susceptible to damage. In order to avoid NIHL, the individual should avoid being exposed to loud noise for prolonged periods. Helicopter pilots and military jet pilots tend to suffer from NIHL.

It includes cosmic radiation which comes from the sun and stars, terrestrial radiation which comes from the Earth, and civilisation radiation which results from medically applied radiation, household radiation, etc. This adds up to about 3.9 to 4.0 mSv per year in Europe. As stated above, everyone, everywhere, is exposed to cosmic radiation. We are protected from cosmic radiation by Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere. However, at higher altitudes in an airplane and particularly when closer to the North and South poles, the protection is less. During a commercial flight, cosmic radiation is several times higher than on the ground. According to studies, 1 h of flight time at cruise altitude cause an additional amount of 0.01 mSv of cosmic radiation, which means that the annual exposure of flight crew members adds up to about the same amount of background radiation.",

Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, and have a low level of visual acuity, as many rods are connected to each optic nerve fibre (so the \"resolution\" of the vision is less). Rods are highly sensitive to light, hence their usefulness in low light conditions. Conversely, cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), having much lower light sensitivity, and are capable of colour vision. They have a much higher visual and spatial acuity. The central fovea of the eye is populated exclusively by cones, which is the focal point of our vision. As mentioned above, the fovea contains only cones, but the surrounding area of the retina contains mostly rods, with some cones, just more sparsely populated. This means that the answer must be, \"Cones are more sensitive to colours than rods.\", as rods have no ability to detect colour, whereas cones do.",

It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal sleep is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase. => During any normal night’s sleep, the pattern operates on an approximately 90 minutes cycle. Towards the end of the first 90 minutes od falling asleep, the first REM stage occurs, but this first REM experience lasts only 10 to 20 minutes before the person passes back into slow wave sleep. At the end of the second cycle of 90 min, the duration of REM sleep periods increases. During a 8 hour sleep period, an individual is likely to experience 4 to 5 REM sleep episodes.",

This should be considered by operators when determining a reasonable time period for the guidance of crew members. Most divers know air travel immediately following a scuba dive increases the amount of nitrogen in your bodily tissues and can lead to decompression sickness. Looking at the GM (guidance material) above, the effective minimum is 24 hours between SCUBA diving and performing a flight. This is not reduced by using oxygen-enriched air (air cannisters with more than 21% oxygen), although this type of diving can decrease the usual chance of decompression sickness due to lower nitrogen pressure.

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

However, two functions are not compensated: night vision and learning ability. In addition, physiological reactions necessary may cause some fatigue. The civil regulation recognizes the altitude of 8 000 ft as the maximum permissible in the commercial transport of passengers (FAR and CS-25 § 841). c - The incomplete compensation zone is between 3 500 m to 6 000 m (between 11 500 ft and 18 500 ft to 20 000 ft). It is characterized by the risk of psychiatric disorders, typical of acute hypoxia. d - The critical zone is located beyond 5 500 to 6 000 m (18 500 to 20 000 ft).

During a sleep period the body is not only recuperating from the physical activity of the day but it is also carrying out essential organization of the mental processes. Sleep stages. The stages of sleep are classified into 4 stages: Stage 1. The sleeper is in a very light sleep. It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

            "explanation": "ALCOHOL Alcohol acts as a sedative, so it can help you feel more at ease. It may make you feel more socially confident at a party or help you forget your worries. However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

Chemoreceptors in the circulatory system monitor the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the bloodstream and report it to the respiratory centre in the brain stem. When a predefined limit is exceeded, a breathing stimulus is generated. A low partial pressure of oxygen also triggers breathing. However, the strongest stimulus is the CO2 level. Normally, an increased concentration of carbon dioxide is the strongest stimulus to breathe more deeply and more frequently. Conversely, when the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood is low, the brain decreases the frequency and depth of breaths. Human blood always contains a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), which regulates the blood pH. An increase in carbon dioxide turns the blood acid (pH is lower), a decrease in carbon dioxide makes it more alkaline (pH is higher).",

Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later. This means that an aircrew will experience a 29 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours, which means that the crew will suffer from 4 hours jet lag. Travelling Eastwards: New York – London London is 5 hours ahead of New York so noon occurs 5 hours earlier. This means that an aircrew will experience a 19 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours which means that the crew will suffer from 6 hours jet leg. => Jet Lag after travelling westwards is less than Eastwards. Travelling east causes more problems than travelling west. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so lengthening a day is less troublesome than shortening it. Each individual must work out his/her own methods for dealing with circadian dysrhythmia because jet lag varies substantially among individuals.

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

White blood cells are of various types; they resemble amoebae and have large nuclei to engulf and destroy invading bacteria. Their main function is the defence against disease. They produce antibodies to fight bacteria and antitoxins to neutralise the toxins produced by bacteria. Platelets are the smallest of the blood cells and assist in the blood clotting process.",

This causes the eyes to relax and seek a comfortable focal distance which may range from 10 to 30 feet away, for example. For the pilot, this means looking without seeing, which is dangerous. Searching out and focusing on distant points, such as the tip of the wing or the edge of a cloud, will help to prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.

If a Rapid Decompression occurs, unconsciousness will develop very quickly if no action is taken. This is one reason why passengers shall fit their own mask before helping others. The first action by the flight crew must be to don oxygen masks. Once crew communication is established, if cabin altitude is deemed uncontrollable, pilots should initiate an emergency descent to the lowest safe altitude or 10 000 ft whichever is higher. In most airliners, the procedure is that the pilot flying shall advise the cabin crew, on the PA system, of impending rapid descent, whilst the pilot monitoring will advise ATC and obtain the area altimeter setting.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.

Sleep/wake homeostasis balances our need for sleep, called a “sleep drive” or “sleep pressure,” with our need for wakefulness.

Finally, our need for alertness grows, telling us that it’s time to wake up. Our circadian rhythm approximates a homeostasis in coordination with environmental cues like sunlight.

Insect bites should be avoided as much as possible by wearing long clothing, using mosquito nets and repellents. Furthermore, many problems can be avoided by observing a strict personal hygiene routine and taking a few basic precautions. These measures should be observed in all parts of the world. They are: Do not drink tap water, you should drink water from sealed bottles only. Remember that even cleaning teeth in contaminated water can be enough to cause illness. Avoid ice in drinks, unless you are certain that the ice is made from treated water. Peel or cook all fruit and vegetables. The skin may have been contaminated by someone with a communicable disease or also washed with tap water. Avoid salad stuffs and other raw foods which may have been washed in contaminated water. Ice-creams should be avoid as these are generally made from raw fruits and water. You should also avoid swimming in local rivers or lakes as the water may be contaminated.

It passes through a small shutter which can either be flawed or can become jammed causing a rise in pressure of the eye. There are two main kinds of Glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision; Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

That being said, it seems that EASA would like a broad knowledge of medications. The usual size range of droplets dispersed by a nasal spray is between 10-50 micrometers. A micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, whereas a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, 1000 times smaller. Any smaller than this and the droplets become nebulized, and pass on directly to the lungs (not effective), whereas larger particles form droplets and run straight out of the nose. The droplets need to attach directly to the mucous membranes of the nose to be effective. Given the possible answers, about 7 to 12 micrometers would be the closest by far, and could easily work as the droplet size range for a nasal spray. The other answers are either too large; up to half a millimeter (500 micrometers), or too small; a few nanometres, roughly one micrometer. Again, this question has rather limited feedback and is out of the normal learning objectives, any exam feedback on this question would be appreciated and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com.",

After approximately 15 to 30 seconds of constant angular acceleration, such as what occurs during a steady turn, the vestibular system stabilizes to the angular velocity and the pilot may have the illusion that rotation has ceased (sensory habituation).",

The ear is divided into three sections: the outer, middle and inner ear. OUTER EAR. Collects the vibrations of the air, which then travel through the ear canal (Meatus) leading to the eardrum. Sound waves will cause the eardrum to vibrate. MIDDLE EAR. The outer and middle ear are separated by the eardrum (tympanum). Three small bones, the Ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) are connected to the ear drum and transmit the vibrations across the middle ear to the inner ear. The last bone of the ossicles (the stapes) connects directly to the oval window. Here, a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear. The Eustachian Tube vents to the mouth and nose allowing pressure to equalise across the ear drum. INNER EAR. The diaphragm attached to the oval window causes the fluid (endolymph) in the Cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. Their movement will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound, allowing our brain to translate the tiny pressure waves into sound that we hear. The inner ear also houses the semicircular canals, and these are used for our sense of balance, and are not part of the hearing system. This question is quite complex, so we can go through the other options as well: A) Presbycusis (hearing loss with age) is due to gradual wear of the chain of ossicles. Presbycusis is the hearing loss due to age, but is less to do with the ossicles, and more in relation to the cochlea losing sensitivity in the hairs which stimulate the nerve endings. B) When standing upright, the utriculus senses linear acceleration along the z axis as well as gravity. The utriculus is one of the otoliths (the utriculus and the saccule), which detect accelerations on the body. The utriculus senses horizontal accelerations (so not gravity or z-axis [vertical] accelerations) and the saccule detects gravity and vertical accelerations. C) At the oval window, vibrating the chain of ossicles induces pressure waves in the endolymph. This is written a little backwards, but is just about grammatically correct. Nonetheless, it means that vibrations within the ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) are converted into pressure waves in the endolymph within the cochlea, which is exactly what happens. It is saying that this conversion happens through the oval window, which is also correct. D) The chain of ossicles is in the middle ear and connects the vibrations in the tympanic membrane to the sensors in the semicircular canals. The semicircular canals are balance organs, and do not sense sounds, that happens in the cochlea.",

For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.03.03.14: Describe the problems associated with Type 2 (mostly adult) diabetes: risk factors; insulin resistance; complications (vascular, neurological) and the consequences for the medical licence; pilots are not protected from Type 2 diabetes more than other people. This question requires more feedback to be able to pinpoint the answer the examiners have chosen. It is entirely possible that some of the options are different from the actual exam question, or that different authorities are using slightly different questions with different answers. Let's go through each possible option: A) \"Controlling one’s diet and regular exercise are the most effective treatments, as the type of diabetes cannot be treated with insulin.\" In reality, type II diabetes can be managed through various methods, including lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as medication. While controlling diet and exercise are indeed important components of managing type 2 diabetes and can sometimes be sufficient to control blood sugar levels, many individuals with type II diabetes may also require insulin therapy to effectively manage their condition. Insulin therapy is commonly used when other treatments are not sufficient to control blood sugar levels or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin on its own. B) \"Risk factors include low blood pressure, increasing age, obesity, a diet rich in simple carbohydrates, and a lack of physical exercise\" Low blood pressure is incorrect. A diet rich in simple carbohydrates is often associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while a diet that emphasises complex carbohydrates can help to manage blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing the condition. C) \"A pilot diagnosed with this type of diabetes must be considered unfit, for class 1 medical certification.\" This is not technically true, as the regulations state below that a pilot would usually be assessed as unfit with this condition, but if they are not taking insulin for it, and can demonstrate that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable, they may be able to gain the medical. There has been potentially ambiguous feedback that this answer could be correct, but given the law stated below, we believe it is not correct. D) \"It is usually diagnosed in adulthood, and a typical symptom is unexplained weight loss.\" This answer may be correct. Whether it is a typical symptom or not is difficult to say, we are not doctors, but it is a symptom. Symptoms are not mentioned in the learning objectives, but this does not make it incorrect. Usually diagnosed in adulthood is absolutely correct. Unfortunately, we currently have no feedback on this answer. EASA AIR CREW MED. B.025 Metabolic and Endocrine Systems (a) Applicants with metabolic, nutritional or endocrine dysfunction may be assessed as fit subject to demonstrated stability of the medical condition and satisfactory aero-medical evaluation. (b) Diabetes mellitus (1) Applicants with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit. (2) Applicants with diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit unless it can be demonstrated that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. (c) Aero-medical assessment (1) Applicants for a class 1 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be referred to the medical assessor of the licensing authority. (2) The fitness of applicants for a class 2 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be assessed in consultation with the medical assessor of the licensing authority. We cannot be sure of the validity of any such feedback, and there are many places where the feedback can be miscommunicated or mistaken. As such, any further exam feedback would be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com",

HYPERVENTILATION Breathing too rapidly or too deeply can cause hyperventilation, a physiological disorder that develops when too much carbon dioxide (CO2) is eliminated from the body. Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level. When we undertake physical activity our body cells use more Oxygen and this in turn produces more CO2. This excess CO2 enters the blood and consequently our breathing increases in depth and rate to remove it.",

To adjust to the new time zone, the circadian system has to advance, or shift forward, or move earlier. This question is quite problematic because it lacks key information - the correct answer will depend on whether the crew is staying for 24 h or less or if they are staying for longer. In the case of short stays, to reduce the effects of jetlag, the crew should keep things as they are by seeking bright light in the evening and keeping the curtains closed in the morning. However, for longer stays, the crew should adapt to the new time zone as soons as possible. Flying to the East, the duration of daylight is shorter, therefore the perceived daylight is shorter. Since the day is shorter, you'll have to go to bed earlier. Consequently, one should avoid bright light in the evening and seek bright light as early as possible in the morning.

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular accelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, weakness (loss of muscular power), feeling and being sick, tiredness and confusion, stomach pain, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, heartbeat, cardiac arrest, seizures, blurred vision, disorientation, loss of consciousness, coma, respiratory failure and death",

The hormone called insulin is responsible for breaking down glucose (sugar) and insulin is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin at all (Type 1) or when the insulin produced does not work properly (Type 2). There are two main types of Diabetes: Type I. This happens when there is no insulin to break down sugar. It typically occurs in younger persons. The risk of developing this type of diabetes is usually related to one’s genes and ethnicity, which are factors that cannot be controlled Type II. This happens when the insulin produced by the pancreas does not work properly. It typically occurs in persons over the age of 40. The risk of developing this type of diabetes increases with a lack of regular exercise, weight gain and a poor diet amongst other factors such as genetics. Up to 80 per cent of cases of Type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by making simple changes in one’s lifestyle including adopting a healthy diet, undertaking regular exercise and controlling one’s weight.",

You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. When a person is required to be awake longer than the credit situation allows, a sleep debit situation will develop. If possible, the following sleep cycle will then be longer than 8 hours to rebuild the full 16 hours of sleep credit. While a short sleep debit will usually not cause any remarkable effects in healthy persons, sleep debit can become cumulative and result in reduced vigilance and performance, with an increased susceptibility to sensory illusions. This problem is very common when forced to work days (or nights) in a row with little time in between that to be used for building up sleep credit. Jet lag/circadian disrhythmia - occurs when conducting transmeridian long-distance flights where shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. Most likely, this question does not refer to long-haul flights but rather short-haul operations, where the crew always returns to base and no shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. The question possibly describes a situation of situational insomnia (inability to sleep due to disrupted work/rest patterns, or circadian dysrhythmia) rather than chronic insomnia (long-term pattern of difficulty sleeping).",

If you are hyperventilating, you might experience drowsiness, tingling sensation in the fingers and toes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, blurred vision and feelings of suffocation. In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level. Realistically, this is very easy, as both statements are effectively the same, so 1 is correct, 2 is correct.",

External Respiration: External respiration refers to the gas exchange between the alveoli and blood capillaries of the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into the blood during external respiration. Carbon dioxide diffuses out from the blood into the alveolar air during external respiration. The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate. If the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is too high, you will breth faster and deeper to eliminate CO2.",

The leans/somatogyral illusion occur when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. If you make such a recovery, your semicircular canals sense a roll in the opposite direction. This may cause you to reenter the original attitude. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans.",

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",
