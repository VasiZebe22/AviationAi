We firmly believe that this question should be appealed. The primary responsibility of GROUND control is to manage and monitor surface movements, which encompass the movement of aircraft on the runway. In some instances, an aircraft that has landed, and is still on the runway, may be transferred to GROUND from TOWER control. The GROUND controller will then provide clearance for the aircraft to proceed to its designated parking area. In addition to aircraft movements, GROUND control is also responsible for regulating the movements of vehicles operating on the aerodrome surface. This includes the coordination of the movement of baggage trolleys, fuel trucks, and other ground vehicles that support aircraft operations. By doing so, GROUND control ensures the safe and efficient operation of the aerodrome surface. Movement area.

ICAO Annex 10 1.3 Communication Methods Air-ground communication. Two-way communication between aircraft and stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. Air-to-ground communication. One-way communication from aircraft to stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. ICAO Annex 10, Volume 2, Communication Procedures Simplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations takes place in one direction at a time. Note.— In application to the aeronautical mobile service this method may be subdivided as follows: a) single channel simplex; b) double channel simplex; c) offset frequency simplex. *Single channel simplex. Simplex using the same frequency channel in each direction. *Offset frequency simplex. A variation of single channel simplex wherein telecommunication between two stations is effected by using in each direction frequencies that are intentionally slightly different but contained within a portion of the spectrum allotted for the operation. *Double channel simplex. Simplex using two frequency channels one in each direction. Duplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations can take place in both directions simultaneously. Note: the term \"half-duplex\" is not mentioned by ICAO and EASA. Students also have not reported that \"half duplex\" has been mentioned in exams, but only simplex and duplex. In several other sources you can get the following information: Simplex: communication in one direction only Half duplex: communication in both directions (alternating) Full duplex: communication in both directions (simultaneously)",

We firmly believe that this question should be appealed. The primary responsibility of GROUND control is to manage and monitor surface movements, which encompass the movement of aircraft on the runway. In some instances, an aircraft that has landed, and is still on the runway, may be transferred to GROUND from TOWER control. The GROUND controller will then provide clearance for the aircraft to proceed to its designated parking area. In addition to aircraft movements, GROUND control is also responsible for regulating the movements of vehicles operating on the aerodrome surface. This includes the coordination of the movement of baggage trolleys, fuel trucks, and other ground vehicles that support aircraft operations. By doing so, GROUND control ensures the safe and efficient operation of the aerodrome surface. Movement area.

ICAO Annex 10 1.3 Communication Methods Air-ground communication. Two-way communication between aircraft and stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. Air-to-ground communication. One-way communication from aircraft to stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. ICAO Annex 10, Volume 2, Communication Procedures Simplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations takes place in one direction at a time. Note.— In application to the aeronautical mobile service this method may be subdivided as follows: a) single channel simplex; b) double channel simplex; c) offset frequency simplex. *Single channel simplex. Simplex using the same frequency channel in each direction. *Offset frequency simplex. A variation of single channel simplex wherein telecommunication between two stations is effected by using in each direction frequencies that are intentionally slightly different but contained within a portion of the spectrum allotted for the operation. *Double channel simplex. Simplex using two frequency channels one in each direction. Duplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations can take place in both directions simultaneously. Note: the term \"half-duplex\" is not mentioned by ICAO and EASA. Students also have not reported that \"half duplex\" has been mentioned in exams, but only simplex and duplex. In several other sources you can get the following information: Simplex: communication in one direction only Half duplex: communication in both directions (alternating) Full duplex: communication in both directions (simultaneously)",

We have, therefore, updated the correct answer to the only possible answer. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam. Thank you. SELCAL is abbreviated for Selective Calling System and it is used in international aviation to alert flight crews of transmission directed to them as they fly transoceanic routes. SECAL operates on HF or VHF frequency bands. An individual aircrafts owns its unique SELCAL code which is used by the controller to address the SELCAL on board of the aircraft. The code is converted into four designated audio tones, then it is broadcast and every aircraft, which has a SELCAL system, receives it. The decoding system reads the tones and triggers a warning for the flight crew if it recognizes its own code. Relating phraseology: When an aeronautical station initiates a call by SELCAL, the aircraft replies with its radio call sign, followed by the phrase “GO AHEAD”. Request SELCAL check XX-XXX (SELCAL code of the aircraft) SELCAL check is coming up for XX-XXX SELCAL OK or NEGATIVE SELCAL ICAO Annex 10 Volume II CHAPTER 5. AERONAUTICAL MOBILE SERVICE — VOICE COMMUNICATIONS 5.2.4 SELCAL procedures 5.2.4.1.1 PANS.— With the selective calling system known as SELCAL, the voice calling is replaced by the transmission of coded tones to the aircraft over the radiotelephony channels. A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",

If anyone encounters a similar question, we kindly request that you inform us. We appreciate your assistance. Thank you! SELCAL is a system used by air traffic control to selectively call individual aircraft over RT channels, which means that the flight crew doesn't have to monitor the channel continuously, especially on long-haul flights. So, we can actually say that it may be used by the controller to start a conversation. As for the \"correct\" answer, it's not entirely accurate to say that SELCAL is used to permit the controller to give instructions or clearance. The controller can give instructions or clearance even if the aircraft is not equipped with SELCAL. The primary purpose of SELCAL is to alert the crew that they need to make contact with ATS and to provide aural and/or visual cues through cockpit call systems. In short, SELCAL is used to alert the crew to contact ATS and eliminates the need for continuous monitoring of the RT call-sign. When an aircraft receives a SELCAL notification, the crew responds with their call sign and \"go ahead\".",

The call should be made on the frequency in use at the time, and the station addressed will normally be that station communicating with the aircraft, or the station in whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating. All other stations should take care not to interfere with the transmission of urgency traffic. => With regards to this question, there is no reason to call \"MAYDAY\" - we are not facing a distress situation - it is rather a possible technical malfunction (which is yet to be confirmed).",

More comprehensive phrases are contained in subsequent Chapters in the context in which they are most commonly used. 3.8 The precise phraseology used in the transmission and acknowledgement of climb and descent clearances will vary, depending upon the circumstances, traffic density and nature of the flight operations. 3.9 However, care must be taken to ensure that misunderstandings are not generated as a consequence of the phraseology employed during these phases of flight. For example, levels may be reported as altitude, height or flight levels according to the phase of flight and the altimeter setting. Therefore, when passing level messages, the following conventions apply: 1. The word ‘to’ is to be omitted from messages relating to FLIGHT LEVELS. 2. All messages relating to an aircraft’s climb or descent to a HEIGHT or ALTITUDE employ the word ‘to’ followed immediately by the word HEIGHT or ALTITUDE. Furthermore, the initial message in any such RTF exchange will also include the appropriate QFE or QNH. Furthermore, the words FEET and FLIGHT LEVEL must never be omitted. NOTE: Even though regulation states that the term “TO” shall be followed by altitude, it seems that the correct option does not state “Altitude”. Therefore, we would say that the most correct option is “Climbing to two thousand five hundred feet.” As there is no “Climbing to altitude two thousand five hundred feet” option available.",

A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",

Detailed SELCAL procedures may be found in Annex 10, Volume II. 11.1.3 Any necessary SELCAL check shall be initiated by using the phrase “REQUEST SELCAL CHECK”. Subsequent receipt of the SELCAL code tone should be acknowledged by the phrase “SELCAL OK”. 11.1.4 In case the coded signal is weak or unable to activate the cockpit call system, the pilot should advise the controller by using the phrase “NEGATIVE SELCAL, TRY AGAIN”. ICAO Annex 10 Volume II 5.2.4 SELCAL procedures 5.2.4.3 PRE-FLIGHT CHECK 5.2.4.3.2 PANS.— When primary and secondary frequencies are assigned, a SELCAL check should normally be made first on the secondary frequency and then on the primary frequency. The aircraft station would then be ready for continued communication on the primary frequency.",

MONITOR “Listen out on (frequency).” NEGATIVE “No” or “Permission not granted” or “That is not correct” or “Not capable”. READ BACK “Repeat all, or the specified part, of this message back to me exactly as received.” RECLEARED “A change has been made to your last clearance and this new clearance supersedes your previous clearance or part thereof.” REPORT “Pass me the following information.” ROGER “I have received all of your last transmission.” Note.— Under no circumstances to be used in reply to a question requiring “READ BACK” or a direct answer in the affirmative (AFFIRM) or negative (NEGATIVE). SPEAK SLOWER “Reduce your rate of speech.” UNABLE “I cannot comply with your request, instruction, or clearance.” Note.— UNABLE is normally followed by a reason. STANDBY “Wait and I will call you.” Note.— The caller would normally re-establish contact if the delay is lengthy. STANDBY is not an approval or denial. WILCO (Abbreviation for “will comply”.) “I understand your message and will comply with it.” Note: We have created the above table based on the questions you may find in your exam, however the table is not extensive.

Once the PTT button is released, the microphone stops transmitting, and the pilot is able to listen to incoming communications from ATC or other aircraft. An irritating and potentially dangerous situation in radiotelephony is a “stuck” microphone button. Operators should always ensure that the button is released after a transmission and the microphone placed in an appropriate place ensuring that it will not inadvertently be switched on. Should your microphone button be stuck in the \"transmit\" position, your radio will keep transmitting permanently, and since VHF communications are not telephone communications, nobody else will be able to talk on that particular frequency, although they will hear everything you say.",

The code is converted into four designated audio tones, then it is broadcast and every aircraft, which has a SELCAL system, receives it. The decoding system reads the tones and triggers a warning for the flight crew if it recognizes its own code. Relating phraseology: When an aeronautical station initiates a call by SELCAL, the aircraft replies with its radio call sign, followed by the phrase “GO AHEAD”. Request SELCAL check XX-XXX (SELCAL code of the aircraft) SELCAL check is coming up for XX-XXX SELCAL OK or NEGATIVE SELCAL",

            "explanation": "Controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC). A means of communication between controller and pilot, using data link for ATC communications. The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

Caution must be exercised with respect to the indication of transmitting channels in VHF radiotelephony communications when five digits of the numerical designator are used in airspace where aircraft are also operated with channel separation capabilities of 8.33/25 kHz. On aircraft installations with a channel separation capability of 8.33 kHz and more, it is possible to select six digits on the radio management panel.

When necessary, the relevant minimum vectoring altitude shall include a correction for low temperature effect. Note 1.— When an IFR flight is being vectored, the pilot may be unable to determine the aircraft’s exact position in respect to obstacles in this area and consequently the altitude which provides the required obstacle clearance. Detailed obstacle clearance criteria are contained in PANS-OPS (Doc 8168), Volumes I and II. See also 8.6.8.2. ICAO Doc 8168 - Aircraft Operations 1.3.4 Vectors Pilots should not accept vectors during departure unless: a) they are above the minimum altitude(s)/height(s) required to maintain obstacle clearance in the event of engine failure. This relates to engine failure between V1 and minimum sector altitude or the end of the contingency procedure as appropriate; or b) the departure route is non-critical with respect to obstacle clearance.",

The flight crew also enters the four character ICAO identifier of the ATSU to which the AFN logon is to be sent. 2.2.3.4 Transferring CPDLC connections 2.2.3.4.2 Under normal circumstances, the controlling ATSU, or current data authority, will initiate CPDLC transfers to adjacent ATSUs as the aircraft transits from one CPDLC-capable ATSU to another. These transfers are normally automatic, without flight crew action. Paragraph 2.2.3.12 provides nonstandard events associated with CPDLC transfers that may require controller action per paragraph 4.1 and/or the flight crew action per paragraph 5.2.3.",

As mentioned in the learning objective above, occasionally, it is useful for ATC to request that an aircraft changes its call sign in order to provide adequate difference with an aircraft of similar call sign, or to avoid confusion when referring to any other things such as locations or procedures, which might sound the same as a call sign. In this case, the two aircraft have very similar callsigns, only separated by \"Tango\" vs \"Bravo\", which are both similar sounding words. In this case, much confusion could be had when conversing with those aircraft, and it is therefore best to ask one to change their call sign. It is usually up to the controller to choose a different call sign, and in this case, they could change \"AT139\" to \"Helicopter 139\", for instance. The messages to change (and then later on revert) call sign from the controller would be: CHANGE YOUR CALL SIGN TO (new call sign) [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED] REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALL SIGN (call sign) [AT (significant point)]",

Note: When told to stand by on a frequency, the pilot is expected to tune that frequency and wait for air traffic control to contact him/her there. For example, Standby for Tower 118.1. In such case, air traffic control is supposed to contact the pilot, not the other way around.",
