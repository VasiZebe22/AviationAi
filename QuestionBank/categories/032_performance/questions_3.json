The buffet boundary has both low and high speed limits: The low speed buffet boundary describes the IAS at which we find the onset of the pre-stall buffet at a 10% margin above VS. The high speed buffet boundary describes the IAS at which we find the onset of Mach related buffet, normally MMO, but sometimes slightly below that. At low altitudes, these speeds are far apart, leaving a wide range of operating speeds. Although stalling IAS remains constant at first as altitude increases, it starts to increase at higher altitude. Also, the IAS at which we get Mach buffet will steadily decrease, because TAS increases in the climb and local speed of sound decreases. The two buffet boundaries will move closer toogether and eventually meet at an altitude where no margins exists, the coffin corner or aerodynamic ceiling, i.e. you cannot fly faster or slower because you will either stall or hit MMO. The right-hand limit on the graph shows the maximum indicated airspeed VMO and then at high altitude the maximum Mach number, MMO. The left-hand limit is based on the stall speed, 1.1 VS. Therefore, with increasing altitude, the low-speed buffet will increase and the high-speed buffet will decrease.",

Therefore, less fuel is required to maintain a constant power output. So, the fuel flow will decrease, not increase. Increasing the fuel flow in an effort to compensate for the decrease in air density would result in an over-rich mixture and potentially cause engine damage. What exactly do they mean by \"maintaining the same power setting?\". We believe it is referring to the amount of power the pilot is requesting from the engine, not the actual power output of the engine. In order to maintain the same power setting, the pilot will likely have to lean the mixture (decrease the fuel flow) to compensate for the decrease in air density at higher altitude. So, even though the pilot is requesting the same amount of power, the engine will produce less power due to the decrease in air density, and the fuel flow will decrease to match the decrease in oxygen available. Note: We are deciding that \"power setting\" means constant RPM/MAP for this question. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam.",

Air density affects the mass flow of air into the engine. As pressure altitude increases, air density decreases, and the engine's performance reduces, resulting in reduced thrust.

The decrease in temperature is good for a jet engine's specific fuel consumption, and cold temperatures and high RPM operation both count to decreasing the engine's specific fuel consumption, which allows it to produce more thrust per kg of fuel burnt. Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow and Fuel Flow = SFC x Drag So as the aircraft's SFC has decreased, and the Drag has remained the same (jets cruise at constant Mach numbers and when only the temperature changes, the IAS also remains constant), so Fuel Flow has decreased. Now we can also say that TAS will decrease, as the density has increased. That means that both the top of the Specific Range equation (TAS) has decreased, and the bottom (Fuel Flow) has also decreased. We do not have exact figures, so how can we work out what the overall effect is? We know from the integrated range tables in the flight planning CAP (697) that a decrease in temperature causes a decrease in fuel consumption over the distances involved in the table, meaning the effect on specific fuel consumption must be the greater effect, and cold temperatures increase specific range. Now the question does not mention this, but with this colder temperature, the aircraft (ATC notwithstanding) will have a slightly higher optimum altitude, and at that altitude, will gain even higher efficiencies from this temperature drop if it able to climb to this higher altitude.

If the OAT decreases, the LSS will decrease as well, since LSS = 38.95 x √ (°K). Therefore, to maintain the balance in the above-mentioned equation, the TAS must decrease.

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag, and is what a car has to overcome (as well as road friction) when it drives along a flat road. Parasite increases with the square of the airspeed, so gets very high when aircraft fly fast. Induced drag is more complex. Its full name is \"lift-induced drag\", and occurs due to our wings re-directing the airflow downwards. The pressure differential (high below, low above) caused by our wing's shape (aerofoil) makes the air want to take a shortcut around the wingtip, which creates sideways movement of air, and creates vortices of air around the wing. To cut an incredibly long explanation short, this energy loss (to create these vortices) is what we know as induced drag, and increases with Coefficient of lift. This means that induced drag is increased when: weight is increased (more weight = more lift required = higher lift coefficient). indicated airspeed, IAS, is decreased (less airflow means we need each particle of air to bend more, so higher lift coefficient - or just look at the lift equation, if speed reduces, something has to increase for the same lift to be made). Anything else causes an increased angle of attack (as angle of attack is directly proportional to coefficient of lift up until the stall). Therefore, given the possible options, the only correct one is \"aircraft weight\". Note: changing altitude does not affect induced drag in this question as we are flying at a constant IAS, which means that the same amount of air particles are flowing over the wing, no matter the altitude we are at, and compressibility effects are to be ignored.",

The increased drag from flaps increases our gradient of descent in accordance with the following formula. Gradient of Descent (%) = [(D - T) / W] x 100 As we are maintaining a constant TAS (True Airspeed), then the Rate of Descent increases also, due to the following formula. ROD (ft/m) = TAS x Gradient of Descent Note: we are not taking into account any wind in these calculations, therefore the gradients of descent are \"still air\" gradients, but wind would not change the answers at all.",

Flying higher or lower than the optimum altitude will decrease the range of the airplane. It is important to understand that the optimum altitude is not fixed. As the weight decreases through fuel burn, the drag curve moves down and left. Therefore, the best range speed, 1.32VMD, falls and the total drag decreases. With decreasing weight, the airplane needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. As it does so, the Mach number will also decrease meaning that the airplane is not limited by the high Mach number and corresponding high drag. This fact allows the airplane to climb a little. As the airplane climbs, the Mach number will increase again to its previous limiting value and drag will increase back to its previous value. But more importantly the higher altitude has decreased the specific fuel consumption. This means that over time, as the weight decreases with fuel burn, the optimum altitude increases. SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ FUEL FLOW Reaching the optimum level, the aircraft specific range increases. As the aircraft mass decreases due to fuel consumption the optimum level will be higher. If the aircraft does not climb to the new optimum altitude the specific range decreases.",

The majority of the statements in this question are quite simple, the ASDA includes the TORA (Take-Off Run Available), and the stopway for the take-off runway, but not the clearway. The other two statements are a little more complex. A starter extension is where a displaced threshold exists, and an aircraft can begin the take-off roll before the threshold of the runway. Therefore, any starter extension is part of the take-off run, and is included in the ASDA. However, the opposite runway stopway (if present) is not automatically considered a starter extension for the take-off runway, so is not included.

Because thrust available against speed is different for turbojet and propeller aeroplanes, it must be established at what speed VX is for both types of aeroplanes. For best angle of climb we need maximum excess thrust. If thrust were constant at all airspeeds, then at VMD where drag is minimum, the excess thrust and climb angle would be maximum. For maximum endurance we must fly at the speed at which fuel flow is minimum. Rate of climb is maximum when excess power is maximum. This occurs at approximately VMP. In prop aircraft fuel flow is proportional to power, so minimum fuel flow occurs at the speed at which power required is minimum. This speed is VMP. Rate of climb is equal to excess power divided by aircraft weight.",

Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow and Fuel Flow = SFC x Drag So as the aircraft's SFC has increased, and the Drag has remained the same (jets cruise at constant Mach numbers and when only the temperature changes, the IAS also remains constant), so Fuel Flow has increased. Now we can also say that TAS will increase, as the density has decreased. That means that both the top of the Specific Range equation (TAS) has increased, and the bottom (Fuel Flow) has also increased. We do not have exact figures, so how can we work out what the overall effect is? We know from the integrated range tables in the flight planning CAP (697) that an increase in temperature causes a increase in fuel consumption over the distances involved in the table, meaning the effect on specific fuel consumption must be the greater effect, and warmer temperatures decrease specific range. Therefore the correct answer is \"SR decreases, SFC increases.\"",

This requires a balancing downforce from the tail plane. With this extra force from the tail plane, lift from the wings must be increased to balance the forces. More lift means more induced drag, which means higher fuel consumption consequently decreasing the maximum range. For an aft CG position, the opposite applies, lower fuel consumption and maximum range increases.",

Using a standard force diagram for an aircraft in the climb gives the equations: (Thrust - Drag)/Weight = sin(angle of climb) Lift/Weight = cos(angle of climb) The first equation is the one to use, and 7% Notes: The force diagram image uses α (alpha) for the climb angle and we are using γ (gamma), either is fine to use, but α is often used for angle of attack so we avoid it for angle of climb. Assuming \"Lift = Weight\" is a bit of a stretch, yes, as lift does not equal weight in the climb, but it is what EASA want you to do, so they can give you more complex questions like this without you having to do too much maths. This allows us to use L/D ratio very easily, so works nicely, even if not fully correct. sin(γ) is a good approximation of the gradient for small angles, even though tan is technically the one to use, they are very close in the angles we usually climb at. We have to convert from a decimal gradient to a percentage at the end by multiplying by 100.",

As they are only going to end up holding anyway, they might as well save some fuel in the cruise, and have to do less holding patterns later on. This is assuming that they have already \"joined the queue\" at their destination airport, which is implied in the question. The best endurance speed in a jet aircraft is the speed at which the engines need to produce the least thrust, as thrust is directly proportional to fuel flow, and we want to make our fuel flow the lowest it can be. The speed of minimum thrust required is the speed of least drag (as thrust directly opposed drag). We called this VMD, for minimum drag speed, and it is the speed that aircraft fly in the holding pattern, and when it is time in the air that is most desirable, rather than distance gone. It occurs at the bottom of the \"total drag\" curve as shown in the annex above, where the combination of induced and parasite drag equals the lowest value. There is no point climbing up to the optimum altitude at this stage, as it is not an efficient use of fuel to climb just before descent. Also, that option is not correct because we do not care about maximum range now, only maximum endurance.",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

VX for a jet is where the tangent from the origin just touches the power required curve, this is VMD, which is VX for a jet. VX for a prop is very close to VMP, the bottom of the power required curve. As the power required curve (Drag x TAS) moves up and right with the increase in TAS as altitude increases then the corresponding values of VX and VY will also increase as a TAS.",

For an airplane powered by jet engines, VX is the same IAS as VMD. VX for a propeller airplane is less than VMD and at low altitudes will be in the region of VMP due to the way power is produced by propeller aircraft. This is also roughly the same speed as maximum endurance due to the minimum drag/power required. VY - Best Rate of Climb Speed The speed to gain more altitude with the least time (Greatest Rate of Climb). This speed is faster than VX as the rate of climb can be improved by speeding up the aircraft. Even though this means higher drag, this drag increase is overwhelmed by the speed increase, which means the aircraft is climbing up a shallower slope, but at a higher speed, so has an overall greater climb rate. It is roughly the same speed as that of maximum range. For a jet, this means it is higher than VMD (usually quoted as 1.32 VMD with maximum range), and for a prop aircraft, this speed should be around VMD. For this question, then, we have to assume that a jet aircraft is being flown, as in a propeller aircraft, VY is effectively the same speed as VMD in most cases, so they could not slow down to VMD If the pilot is flying at VY and slows down to VMD (which is VX), the climb gradient will increase, but the rate of climb will decrease (after the airspeed has stabilised at VX).",

Question 812798 is the PoF counterpart, but this question has been identified at least twice in Performance exams, so we have put it in both subjects. The figure shows the changes that take place as the aircraft speed (TAS) increases. Assuming that propeller RPM and blade pitch angle remains constant, at a low speed the angle of attack will be large, giving a lot of thrust. Alpha will reduce with increasing speed and at about 4 degrees the blade will be operating at its best lift/drag ratio, i.e. the propeller is achieving its highest efficiency. Higher speeds (which can usually only be reached in a dive) will reduce the blade angle of attack to its zero lift value of about minus 4 degrees. At this point, the propeller will be producing zero thrust. The thrust that is produced by the propeller depends on the angle of attack of the blade. The angle of attack of the blade depends in turn on the airspeed and induced airflow through the propeller. At low airspeeds the angle of attack will be large, near the stall, and thrust will be at its maximum. As forward speed increases, the angle of attack decreases and thrust reduces. That means that the maximum thrust produced by a propeller driven aircraft, also occurs at zero forward airspeed and reduces with forward speed. A fixed propeller can only have one optimum combination of forward airspeed and engine RPM and only one optimum propeller efficiency. At all other combinations it operates less efficiently. This effect can be offset to an extent by using a variable pitch propeller, which can change the blade angle, coarsening the blade angle at higher speeds to maintain the optimum angle of attack.",

As we understood from the definition above; mass and the dissemination of the weight to the compartments of aircraft directly effects the service ceiling. FACTORS AFFECTING TAKE-OFF DISTANCE REQUIRED The take-off distance required (TODR) varies with aerodrome conditions, aeroplane mass, and aeroplane configuration. AEROPLANE MASS A heavier aeroplane accelerates more slowly and needs to achieve a faster take-off speed. This results in a longer take-off distance required. When the TODR equals the take-off distance available (TODA), the aeroplane is at its field limited take-off mass (FLTOM) for the given flap setting. AERODROME PRESSURE ALTITUDE The higher an aerodrome’s pressure altitude, the longer the TODR. This is because the air is less dense, which affects both the engine thrust and actual speed at rotation. The reduction in air density reduces the engine mass flow and, therefore, thrust, which results in slower acceleration. Second, the reduced air density results in a faster TAS for the same calibrated airspeed VR. TEMPERATURE Hotter temperatures result in lower air density. Again, this reduces the thrust and, therefore, acceleration of the aeroplane and necessitates a faster TAS for the same VR. WIND The head or tailwind component along the runway affects the ground speed of the aeroplane for the same rotate speed, VR, which is a CAS. A reducing headwind or increasing tailwind increases the actual ground speed, which equates to the same VR. Acceleration to a faster actual ground speed results in a longer take-off run and distance.",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of performance, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their performance exam.",

Therefore, the total power required increases and the selected airspeed will increase as well as moves to the right. An alternative explanation comes throught the Lift formula: L = CL ½ rho V2 S. At a higher gross mass, the Lift required must be increased, to maintain the altitude. With CL (angle of attack) and S (configuration) constant, the airspeed, V, must be increased, so as to increase the Lift required and maintain the altitude constant. The power required is: DRAG x AIRSPEED. With increased Lift required, the induced drag increases and as a result the total drag increases, too.

This would decrease lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but climb higher in the atmosphere, the lower air density means that we have to fly faster to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is an increase in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with increased altitude (ignoring compressibility at very high altitudes). As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with an increase in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the right, due to the increased TAS for the same IAS at higher altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 3, moving to the right.",

This is where feathering the propeller comes in. The blade angle can be sent from its usual pitch setting to around 90º. In other words, the propeller is pointing directly into the airflow, and producing the least amount of drag possible. If the dead engine is not feathered, there will be a noticeable drag penalty for the aircraft, and this may even cause the aircraft to be unable to climb, depending on the power of the live engine and the altitude, etc. Now we are not sure from the wording of this question if maximum continuous power has been set on the live engine, or just enough power to remain level with one engine inoperative, but given the options, it does not matter.

This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. Returning the flaps to their neutral position when no longer required, returns the wing to its former aerodynamic characteristics. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. USE OF TRAILING EDGE FLAPS FOR TAKE-OFF For take-off purposes, the flaps are normally lowered to a position that provides the best lift-drag ratio that can be obtained with the flaps in any position other than fully up. Since the required lift is obtained at a lower airspeed, the take-off run is also reduced. Larger amounts of flap cause a significant increase in drag, which greatly reduces the acceleration and increases the take-off run. The reduced stalling angle of attack and increased drag associated with flaps also reduces the rate and angle of climb. After take-off, a minimum climb gradient is required in the take-off configuration. Climb gradient is reduced by flap, so if climb gradient is limiting, a lesser flap angle may be selected even though it gives a longer take-off distance.",

            "explanation": "VMC is what's known as the minimum control speed. There are 2 different minimum control speeds, VMCA (minimum control speed in the air) and VMCG (minimum control speed on the ground). If you ever just see VMC, you can assume that it is referring to VMCA. The concept behind VMCA is that, if an engine fails, there will be a resulting thrust asymmetry, which will be constantly trying to yaw the aircraft away from the live engine. The more thrust the engine is producing, the higher the asymmetry. We cannot accept this yaw, so have to use the rudder to input enough opposite yaw to fly straight (there is still some sideslip, but the heading is remaining the same). The bigger the rudder, or the larger its movement, the easier this is, so we can counteract a larger asymmetry. For a specific aircraft though, the only way to make the rudder more powerful is by flying faster, as this allows higher airflow over the control surface, providing a larger yawing force. Now imagine that an aircraft has an engine failure when flying at low speed. The remaining engine will be producing up to full thrust, with the rudder receiving very little airflow, so it may be unable to keep the aircraft straight. This is which we have a \"minimum control speed\", VMC, above which, there should be enough airflow over the rudder to keep the aircraft straight, even with the remaining engine(s) producing their full thrust, and therefore the maximum asymmetry. VMC changes with many factors, mostly to do with the thrust from the engines, the higher the thrust, the larger the asymmetry, meaning that the rudder needs higher airflow to counteract this large yaw, so VMC is higher. In this question, then, the aircraft is descending to a lower altitude. This means that the air will be more dense, and the engines (whether piston or turbine) will produce more power/thrust, therefore larger asymmetry, etc., causing higher VMC. As the aircraft is flying at the \"old VMC\", but the VMC has increased, the aircraft is now flying below the new VMC. It is a minimum control speed, so below it, the aircraft will not be capable of full directional control, as the rudder does not have enough yawing power available at full extension. Note: this scenario is not really possible, because the pilot would either accelerate due to the extra power, or reduce the power to allow them to remain controllable, but the examiner is not examining this.",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

            "explanation": "Note: The question did not mention whether the climb gradient of 4.5% is in still air, or after the wind has been applied. They have given us a height difference formula, though, which includes a correction for TAS being different from groundspeed, and therefore a wind correction will apply itself automatically in that formula, so we can assume the 4.5% is in still air, which is also what you would usually get from using a climb gradient graph or calculation. The height difference formula that they have given us is a lovely addition to this question, and makes it a lot more simple. Calculating the head/tailwind requires us to use trigonometry, or one of the wind component charts like in the CAP. The headwind (in this case) is the windspeed* multiplied by cosine of the angle difference from runway heading, so as our wind is 230º and runway is 27 (270º), the difference is 40º, meaning that the headwind component is 14 x cos(40º) = 10.7 knots. *Note that the full windspeed is used, as we are trying to make an actual height calculation here, not a legal minimum height as we would do in MEP and class A aircraft. SEP aircraft have no obstacle clearance requirements, so there are no such \"50% of headwind, 150% of tailwind\" rules to apply. This means that the groundspeed is 115 - 10.7 = 104.3 kts. The ground distance off the figure before the obstacle (control tower) is 3 NM, so 3 x 6080 = 18 240 ft Using the formula then, the height difference is ((18240 x 4.5)/ 100) x (115/104.3) = 905 ft This is the height difference, and is added to the 50 ft screen height which is assumed to be gained at the end of the runway, so the total altitude upon reaching the obstacle is 955 ft. Minus the obstacle height of 200 ft, this means that the obstacle clearance is 755 ft, closest answer 753 ft.",

Therefore, less fuel is required to maintain a constant power output. So, the fuel flow will decrease, not increase. Increasing the fuel flow in an effort to compensate for the decrease in air density would result in an over-rich mixture and potentially cause engine damage. What exactly do they mean by \"maintaining the same power setting?\". We believe it is referring to the amount of power the pilot is requesting from the engine, not the actual power output of the engine. In order to maintain the same power setting, the pilot will likely have to lean the mixture (decrease the fuel flow) to compensate for the decrease in air density at higher altitude. So, even though the pilot is requesting the same amount of power, the engine will produce less power due to the decrease in air density, and the fuel flow will decrease to match the decrease in oxygen available. Note: We are deciding that \"power setting\" means constant RPM/MAP for this question. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam.",

However, it is good airmanship to calculate obstacle clearance like this. The aircraft should have reached a screen height of 50 ft by the DER (departure end of runway), and the climb gradient (in still air) is 5%. The reason we can tell that this is the still air climb gradient is that the formula at the bottom of the question that they have given us includes a correction for head/tailwind, so the original glimb gradient must not be corrected. The formula at the bottom of the question does make this a lot more simple, as we can just input our numbers into that formula for the majority of the working. GD = Ground Distance = 1 NM = 6080 ft. Climb Gradient = 5% TAS = 133 kt GS = 133 kt + 10 kt = 143 kt (Note: As this is not a legal calculation, we do not apply the 50% of headwind/150% of tailwind factor) Height Difference = ((6080 x 5)/100) x (133/143) = 282.7 ft = 283 ft Then add on the 50 ft screen height we started with to get 283 + 50 = 333 ft 333 ft is the height of our aircraft, 104 ft is the height of the obstacle. Our obstacle clearance is 333 - 104 = 229 ft",

The TAS depends on the density altitude. If the air is warmer it has a lower density, the density altitude of the landing airport is therefore higher. The TAS will therefore be higher for the same IAS approach speed. This means that the aircraft's groundspeed will be higher on approach if the airport is warmer. This increases landing distance required and is therefore bad for \"landing performance\".

For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Therefore, it makes sence to select a higher flap setting when taking-off from a short runway. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce and go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. => Using a low flap setting is recommended when distance obstacles are present. Using less flaps would provide a better climb gradient, but with the cost of a longer take-off run. Therefore if we have a long runway and obstacles at distance less flap setting should be used. In addition to this at higher altitudes and temperatures, thrust will be less, thus take-off run is longer. Using lower flaps also decreases drag and acceleration is faster. This combination is the most suitable for low flap settings.",

This loss of energy is managed mostly by drag, braking and thrust reversers (if available). The more energy the aircraft has (faster speed over the threshold, higher weight, more height over the threshold), the longer the runway needs to be to allow the aircraft to slow down sufficiently. A pilot used to flying into long runways does not usually have to worry about having too much energy, although an approach that is too fast is a bad approach and will usually lead to a poor landing, or a very long flare. If this pilot then flies to a much shorter runway and uses the same technique, then they will land with a higher speed than they should, which will invalidate the performance figures and mean they either flare for a large distance (using up valuable runway) and land at a normal speed, or they might try and land at a speed which is too fast, and then use up more runway braking from a higher speed. Either of these could result in an overrun. To land on a short runway, the performance figures must be correct and the pilot must fly the short field approach and landing as per the procedure, otherwise the performance figures are invalid. This procedure often includes items such as a slower approach speed than usual, a different flap setting, a slightly different landing style, etc.",

For a jet engine the net thrust is the difference between the gross thrust and the intake momentum drag. Increasing speed increases the intake momentum drag, which reduces the thrust. However, at higher speeds the increased intake pressure due to ram effect helps to reduce this loss of thrust, and eventually at very high speeds it will cause the net thrust to increase again. During take-off the airplane speed is still low and as such the ram effect is insufficient to counteract the loss of thrust due to intake momentum drag, therefore during the take-off there will be a decrease of thrust. Propeller. For a propeller driven aircraft, thrust is produced by a propeller converting the shaft torque into propulsive force. For a fixed pitch propeller, angle of attack decreases as forward speed increases. Thrust therefore decreases with increasing speed. For a variable pitch propeller, the propeller will initially be held in the fine pitch position during take-off and the propeller angle of attack will decrease with increasing speed. Above the selected rpm the propeller governor will come into operation, increasing the propeller pitch, and reducing the rate at which the thrust decreases. In summary therefore, the thrust of a propeller airplane decreases with forward speed.",

Thus, the en-route glide gradients will be steeper than the gross gradients, by 0.5%. The question asks for the net distance, so we use the net gradient for our calculations. The assumed en-route gradient shall be the gross gradient of descent increased by a gradient of 0.5% (worse than average gradient), thus giving us a safety margin. So, we use a descent gradient of 10.5%. Using the formulae given, we get: 1. Still air distance = (Height difference x 100) / Net gradient % = [(5 000 ft - 300 ft) x 100] / 10.5 = 44 762 ft or 44 762 ft/6080 = 7.36 NM. 2. Ground distance = Still air distance x (GS/TAS) = 7.36 NM x (120 kt + 15 kt) / 120 kt = 8.3 NM. NOTE: The gradient may also be given as a Lift/Drag ratio. For example, if you are given a L/D ratio 12:1, then if gliding with VMD, your gradient will be 1/12 = 0.083 or 8.33%.",

This will either augment thrust, or augment drag which will increase or decrease the accelerating force. When the aircraft is on a downslope, the weight component will act in the direction of thrust => adding forward force. As a result, deceleration decreases which increases landing distance and decreases take-off distance. Whereas, on an upslope situation, the component of weight acts in the direction of drag (backwards along the longitudinal axis). This will result in a reduced acceleration force and, consequently, decreased landing distance and increased take-off distance.

            "explanation": "Note: It is quite rare to see an aircraft with two anti-clockwise rotating propellers. Most aircraft are either made with 2 clockwise rotating propellers or with 1 clockwise and 1 anticlockwise to remove the critical engine (counter-rotating) For a multi-engine airplane, a large asymmetric thrust moment occurs when an engine fails, but not all engine failures are equal. The engine failure which most adversely affects the performance and handling is deemed the critical engine, and is used to determine the limiting control speeds that will ensure adequate directional control in such an event (as a failure of the critical engine is the worst case scenario). If an aircraft has 4 engines, then the outboard engines produce more asymmetry, so they are more critical than the inboard engines. For a propeller driven aircraft, the critical engine in flight depends on the direction of rotation of the propellers. A propeller suffers from many secondary effects, such as the asymmetric blade effect (P-factor), which creates a critical engine. The asymmetric blade effect means that the down-going blades of a propeller produce higher thrust than the upgoing blades, due to the angle of attack of the aircraft, shifting the propeller disc. The total thrust vector of the engine therefore moves slightly towards the side of the down-going propellers. This effect is most pronounced at low airspeeds, when the aircraft is at a high angle of attack. For an anti-clockwise rotating propeller (we always refer to the propeller direction as viewed from behind), the down going propeller blades are on the left, and therefore both engine's thrust vectors are off to the left. This means that the left engine thrust vector is further from the fuselage, and has a higher moment arm, so this causes a larger asymmetry if it is the only working engine. That makes the right engine the critical engine. During a crosswind take-off an airplane tends to weathercock into wind. Because of this, the failure of the outboard engine on the windward side of the airplane is the most difficult to counteract and is, therefore, the critical engine for jet-propelled aircraft (jet engines have no asymmetric blade effect, so jet aircraft often do not have a critical engine). This does not matter for this question though, as the aircraft is twin engined and propeller driven, and has already taken off, so the crosswind effect is no longer important.",

This loss of energy is managed mostly by drag, braking and thrust reversers (if available). The more energy the aircraft has (faster speed over the threshold, higher weight, more height over the threshold), the longer the runway needs to be to allow the aircraft to slow down sufficiently. A pilot used to flying into long runways does not usually have to worry about having too much energy, although an approach that is too fast is a bad approach and will usually lead to a poor landing, or a very long flare. If this pilot then flies to a much shorter runway and uses the same technique, then they will land with a higher speed than they should, which will invalidate the performance figures and mean they either flare for a large distance (using up valuable runway) and land at a normal speed, or they might try and land at a speed which is too fast, and then use up more runway braking from a higher speed. Either of these could result in an overrun. To land on a short runway, the performance figures must be correct and the pilot must fly the short field approach and landing as per the procedure, otherwise the performance figures are invalid. This procedure often includes items such as a slower approach speed than usual, a different flap setting, a slightly different landing style, etc.",

As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: The down-going blade (viewed from the cockpit) will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-swinging blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line. Propellers rotating in the same direction (clockwise): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa. The left engine is therefore the critical engine. Counter-rotating propellers: they are called counter-rotating propellers because the propeller on one wing turn in the opposite direction to the one on the other wing. The principle advantage of counter-rotation is to balance propeller torque effects thus eliminating any problems associated with a Critical engine. => For both counter-rotating inwards or outwards, the yawing moment will be the same regardless if the right or left engine fails. However, for a counter-rotating inwards propeller, the yawing moment will be smaller than that for a counter-rotating outwards propeller. The down-going blade for the counter-rotating inwards will be in the inner side and, consequently, the thrust vector will be close to the CG; whereas for counter-rotating outwards propellers, the down-going blade will be in the outer side, resulting in a longer thrust arm and larger yawing moment.",

On hot days (above ISA + 15°C), the TGT limit is reached first. If the outside air temperature gets hotter, the TGT is reached at a slightly slower rpm, resulting in the mass flow and thrust available reducing. Conversely, the thrust available increases as the outside air temperature gets colder. This is because the rpm at which the TGT becomes limiting is faster, and, therefore, the mass flow is greater. Therefore, as temperature increases above ISA + 15°C, thrust reduces. The red line in the graph below shows this. However, at outside air temperatures below ISA + 15°C, the rpm limit is reached first. Provided the thrust is regulated by the rpm limit, the thrust does not change with temperature. This is shown by the blue line in the above graph. The rpm can be limited manually by a flight engineer, but is normally achieved today electronically by flat rating the engine below ISA + 15°C. Vice versa (for the conditions mentioned above) if temperature decreases it will effect pozitive for the performance.",

Secondly, the slipstream from that propeller will no longer be flowing over the section of wing behind it, so a significant amount of slipstream induced lift is also lost. Finally, the drag of the aircraft increases, as now, instead of a spinning propeller creating thrust, there are stopped propeller blades creating drag. So therefore, the total drag has increased, therefore the thrust required has increased (as thrust required equals drag for level, unaccelerated flight). Also, the thrust available has been cut in half. These two items both have a detrimental effect on excess thrust (which we need if we want to accelerate or climb at all). See the graphs in the figure above, and notice how they come together, and remove the excess thrust to almost nothing. As for this question, the excess thrust is the amount of extra thrust available after overcoming drag, so if the total available thrust is halved, then the excess thrust is reduced by more than half (more than 50%). Compound this with the increased drag, and the effect is even greater.",

Thus, the en-route glide gradients will be steeper than the gross gradients, by 0.5%. The question asks for the net distance, so we use the net gradient for our calculations. The assumed en-route gradient shall be the gross gradient of descent increased by a gradient of 0.5% (worse than average gradient), thus giving us a safety margin. So, we use a descent gradient of 8.5%. Using the formulae given, we get: 1. Still air distance = (Height difference x 100) / Net gradient % = [(8000 ft - 1500 ft) x 100] / 8.5 = 76 470 ft or 76 470 ft/6080 = 12.58 NM. 2. Ground distance = Still air distance x (GS/TAS) = 12.58 NM x (200 kt - 20 kt) / 200 kt = 11.3 NM. NOTE: The gradient may also be given as a Lift/Drag ratio. For example, if you are given a L/D ratio 12:1, then if gliding with VMD, your gradient will be 1/12 = 0.083 or 8.33%.",

Also, the Class B take-off uses a screen height of 50 ft, rather than 35 ft, and the speed at that height is not usually referred to as V2, being described in more general terms. The most obvious constraint on VR is that the aircraft must be operating above the stall speed in the take-off configuration, which is called VS1. For a single-engine aeroplane: VR must not be less than VS1. The speed at 50 ft after take-off must not be less than: the highest of a speed that is safe under all reasonably expected conditions including turbulence or a critical loss of thrust or 1.2 VS1.",

            "explanation": "Asymmetric blade effect (also known as ‘P’ Factor) Propeller blades are not flat, they are in fact shaped as small wings. As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: The down-going blade (viewed from the cockpit) will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-swinging blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line. Propellers rotating in the same direction (clockwise): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa. The left engine is therefore the critical engine. Counter-rotating propellers: they are called counter-rotating propellers because the propeller on one wing turn in the opposite direction to the one on the other wing. The principle advantage of counter-rotation is to balance propeller torque effects thus eliminating any problems associated with a Critical engine. => For both counter-rotating inwards or outwards, the yawing moment will be the same regardless if the right or left engine fails. However, for a counter-rotating inwards propeller, the yawing moment will be smaller than that for a counter-rotating outwards propeller. The down-going blade for the counter-rotating inwards will be in the inner side and, consequently, the thrust vector will be close to the CG; whereas for counter-rotating outwards propellers, the down-going blade will be in the outer side, resulting in a longer thrust arm and larger yawing moment.",

            "explanation": "When a multi-engined aircraft loses an engine, not only does thrust (or power) reduce, but the overall drag is increased, so more thrust is required. The drag increases due to the dead engine, for both a jet or a propeller engine, however, propellers can be feathered to reduce that drag to a minimum. Drag also increases due to the control deflections that are required to keep the aircraft flying straight, and by the sideslip induced when maintaining wings level. In this case, it is a propeller aircraft, so produces power. This means that when the engine fails, the power required will increase, due to the increased drag mentioned above, whilst the power available is decreased by 50%, due to the loss of one engine's power output. This has put the aircraft into a \"power deficit\", where the power required is higher than the power available. This means that there is not enough thrust to overcome the drag, and the aircraft has begun to descend. This is often called a drift-down, where an aircraft descends into the denser air until the remaining engine is powerful enough to maintain altitude on its own. To go through the available options: \"The power required has reduced because drag is increased by the stationary propeller and the required control inputs to maintain direction, and the remaining engine has sufficient excess power.\" INCORRECT. The remaining engine does NOT have sufficient excess power, and the power required has increased. \"The power available has reduced because the feathered propeller only produces a small amount of thrust compared to normal and therefore the power required is less than the power available.\" INCORRECT. A feathered propeller does not provide any thrust, just less drag, and the power required is MORE than the power available. \"The pilot must NOT have feathered the propeller of the failed engine, because ALL twin-engined aeroplanes that are certified in accordance with CS-23 must be able to climb within their environmental envelope.\" INCORRECT. Whilst there are requirements for certain climb gradients (after take-off or go-around) for some operations, no aircraft is expected to have a positive climb gradient with an engine failed throughout their whole environmental envelope, which we are assuming to mean up to their maximum operating altitude. \"The increased drag from the propeller of the failed engine and the required control inputs to maintain direction mean that the power from the remaining engine is insufficient to maintain altitude.\" CORRECT. Yes, nothing wrong with that option. Drag increased so power required increased, and power available was cut in half.",

Thinner air, whether caused by a higher altitude, a higher temperature or a lower pressure decreases aircraft performance in two ways: It decreases the amount of air going into the engine, which means that less fuel can be introduced in order to maintain the correct fuel to air mixture. This produces less power output from the engine and decreases the thrust generated by the fans in the turbofan engines. This increases the amount of time (and therefore runway distance) that it takes to accelerate to take-off speeds. At a particular airspeed, there is less actual air (fewer air particles) moving across the wings. Since this is what produces lift, the airplane must be moving faster in order to create the same amount of lift. This requires more time, and therefore more runway. High elevation = less density/lower pressure = less performance by the engine. Low QNH = less density/lower pressure = less performance by the engine.

The thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller, when viewed from the rear, is displaced to the right of the engine center line. If both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. To overcome the disadvantage of the critical engine, engines may be designed to counter-rotate. This means that the left engine rotates clockwise, and the right engine rotates anti-clockwise, giving both engines the smallest possible thrust arm.",

Alternatively; The runway designation marking shown at the thresholds of paved runways is the whole number nearest one‐tenth the magnetic azimuth of the centerline of the runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. That means that the available runway 01/19 has an approximate magnetic direction of 010º/190º and the runway 07/25 a magnetic direction of 070º/250º. Taking-off and landing into the wind or with the least possible crosswind component is a priority, because the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of the aircraft are enhnaced. Comparing the angle differences between the available runways' magnetic directions and the wind direction, we get that the wind 350°(M)/25 kt is only 20° off the available runway 01. Thus, using this runway the least possible crosswind and the maximum possible headwind will be experienced during take-off. So, the runway 01 should be preferred by the pilot.",

What we have to do then, is take the lowest speed that it could possibly be for any aircraft, in other words, which of these answers is technically correct for both single and multi-engine class B aircraft?

In the 1st scenario, the aircraft will land long, but at the correct speed, stopping further along the runway than usual. In the 2nd scenario, the pilot is too fast, so will either land correctly, and just take longer to slow down, or could flare too much (due to their extra lift), and potentially porpoise a little down the runway. This is much worse than just using extra braking, and can sometimes result in a go-around if it gets bad.

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

Landing on wet and contaminated runways has three effects: There is a risk of hydroplaning on water and slush surfaces leading to a marked reduction in the coefficient of friction, which leads to longer landing distances. On ice and packed snow the coefficient of friction is markedly reduced without hydroplaning, which leads to longer landing distances. Where hydroplaning is not present there is a displacement drag caused by the tyres pushing contaminant out of the way and an impingement drag as the contaminent is thrown up to hit the airframe. This tends to reduce landing distance. But the #1 and #2 effects of the wet and contaminated runways above, which increase the landing distance required, far outweigh the effects of drag in #3.",

            "explanation": "Propeller thrust is produced by using a jet or a piston engine to drive a propeller. The lifting surface of the blade produces a thrust that drives the engine forward. Turboprops produce an additional element of thrust from the jet pipe. The thrust that is produced, depends on the angle of attack of the blade, which depends in turn on the airspeed and the induced airflow through the propeller. At low airspeeds, the angle of attack will be large, near to the stall and thrust will be at maximum. With a constant speed propeller, as forward speed builds up, the angle of attack decreases and thrust reduces. This means that the maximum thrust produced by a constant speed propeller driven aircraft occurs at zero forward speed and reduces with forward speed. This effect can be offset to an extent by using a variable pitch propeller, coarsening the blade angle at higher speeds to maintain the optimum angle of attack.",

            "explanation": "For this question, we can assume that the examiner means \"in the event of an engine failure\". We don't know if that is included in the real question text or not, due to feedback limitations. Asymmetric blade effect (also known as ‘P’ Factor) Propeller blades are not flat, they are in fact shaped as small wings. As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: The down-going blade (viewed from the cockpit) will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-swinging blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line with clockwise rotating blades (viewed from behind). Propellers rotating in the same direction (clockwise): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa. The left engine is therefore the critical engine. The figure above shows this case. Counter-rotating propellers: they are called counter-rotating propellers because the propeller on one wing turn in the opposite direction to the one on the other wing. The principle advantage of counter-rotation is to balance propeller torque effects and reduce P-factor for both engines (not just one) thus eliminating a critical engine. For both counter-rotating inwards or outwards, the yawing moment will be the same regardless if the right or left engine fails. However, for a counter-rotating inwards propeller, the yawing moment will be smaller than that for a counter-rotating outwards propeller. The down-going blade for the counter-rotating inwards will be in the inner side and, consequently, the thrust vector will be close to the CG; whereas for counter-rotating outwards propellers, the down-going blade will be in the outer side, resulting in a longer thrust arm and larger yawing moment. This is why counter-rotating propellers are always assumed to be rotating inwards, unless specified otherwise, as it has no benefit to fit outwards counter rotating props. As for the other options: Placing the engines further from the aircraft's centre line (longitudinal axis) would make asymmetric thrust worse in the event of an engine failure. The amount of blades per propeller does not really influence thrust asymmetry. The movement of engines forwards or backwards does not affect thrust asymmetry, only their distance from the longitudinal axis (left/right)",

            "explanation": "FACTORS AFFECTING TAKE-OFF DISTANCE REQUIRED The take-off ground run and, consequently, the take-off distance required (TODR) varies with aerodrome conditions, aeroplane mass, and aeroplane configuration. AEROPLANE MASS An aeroplane with a higher mass will have more inertia, decreasing acceleration. This results in a longer take-off distance required. => Therefore, decreasing take-off mass, will result in an increased acceleration and decreased take-off ground run required. AIR DENSITY Density is determined by pressure, temperature and humidity. A low density of the air/high altitude, reduces engine and propeller performance (the reduction in air density reduces the engine mass flow and, therefore, thrust, which results in slower acceleration). Consequences: Higher take-off speed. Longer take-off distance required. => Increasing air density and decreasing pressure altitude will result in a shorter take-off ground run. WIND Winds affect the true ground speed of the aeroplane for any given true airspeed. Headwinds: reduce the ground speed at the required take-off airspeed and reduce the take-off ground run. Tailwinds: higher ground speed and longer take-off ground run. FLAP SETTINGS Flap settings has an effect on the wing's lift coefficient and on the aerodynamic drag. Increasing flap setting/flap angle increases the lift coefficient, which reduces stalling speed and take-off speed. This reduces the take-off ground run. RUNWAY CONDITIONS If the runway is sloping, a component of the weight acts along the runway and increases or decreases the acceleration force. Downhill slope increases the accelerating force, and therefore reduces the take-off distance. Uphill slope reduces the accelerating force and increases the take-off distance. The runway surface condition has effect on the wheel drag. If the runway is contaminated by snow, slush or standing water, the wheel drag will be greater. Thus the accelerating force decreases and the take off distance required increases. => Based on the above, the correct option is: decreasing take-off mass (1), increasing density (3), increasing flap setting (5) and decreasing pressure altitude (8).",

            ],
            "explanation": "For this question, it is best to go through each statement individually: \"1. The critical engine is the right engine.\" Correct, the critical engine is the engine which causes a larger thrust asymmetry (worse effect) if it fails. With anti-clockwise rotating propellers, the down going propeller blades (which produce more lift than up-going blades due to \"P-factor\", the asymmetric blade effect) are to the left hand side of the engines, so the thrust line of each engine is to the left of the engine centre, and therefore a loss of the right hand engine gives a total thrust line furthest from the aircraft centre, hence greater asymmetry, and more rudder required. \"2. The pilot should lift the wing of the dead engine to correct for roll effect.\" Correct, the reduction in airflow over the wing with the failed engine will cause it to lose a lot of lift that previously came from the propeller wash, so that wing will want to drop. The pilot has to provide the opposite force to the controls (lifting the dead engine side wing) to keep the wings level, alongside applying the correct rudder. \"3. The pilot should pitch nose down to increase airspeed.\" Correct. During take-off, the loss of half the aircraft's power output will require a reduction in the climb angle, so the pilot must pitch down to avoid a low speed situation and potential stall. \"4. The right engine failing creates a greater yaw effect due to being the critical engine.\" Correct. See the explanation for statement 1. \"5. The pilot should retract gear to reduce drag but keep flaps extended to create more lift.\" Incorrect. The pilot should retract the gear to reduce drag, yes, but they should retract the flaps for the same reason, if possible. If the airspeed is too slow to retract flaps safely, then it is often best for performance to accelerate to flap retraction speed first, then attempt to climb at the VYSE. The specifics of this will be dependent on the manufacturer's training material, but this statement is always incorrect as the flaps should always be retracted when possible to improve single engine climb performance. \"6. VXSE is always greater than VYSE.\" Incorrect. VXSE and VYSE are the single engine versions of VX and VY, the best angle of climb and best rate of climb speeds, respectively. VX is always lower than VY, unless they are the same speed, and the same goes for VXSE and VYSE, which are even more commonly quoted as the same speed for stall prevention or for ease of memory.",

As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: The down-going blade (viewed from the cockpit) will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-swinging blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line. Propellers rotating in the same direction (clockwise): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa. The left engine is therefore the critical engine. => For this reason, a failure of the right engine would be most favourable. A right engine failure requires a lot of left rudder. A condition where left wind is present would reduce the required left rudder => remember that left wind results in left yaw.",

As the other options are quite confusing, it is useful to go though each of them individually. \"is at least 60 m wide from the end of the TORA, gradually extending to a maximum 300m width along the planned flight path.\" The obstacle accountability area has a half-width of 60 m + 1/2 wingspan. This is not its full width, instead we measure everything from the middle to the edge, as that is the horizontal distance from the assumed aircraft location. Even if the examiner said 60 m half-width, then 300m would still be incorrect, as part (C)(1) above mentions 600m when a track change >15º has been made after departure. \"is effectively substituted by ensuring the weather conditions during operation are sufficient to visually navigate and avoid obstacles.\" Whilst this is a little bit of a leap, it is still the most correct answer present, as VMC conditions do allow for much reduced obstacle clearance criteria to be accounted for, in a couple of ways. \"commences at the assumed engine failure height and will gradually widen as the distance along the flight path increases.\" The obstacle accountability area commences at the end of the TODA, or the end of the TOD if there is a turn scheduled before the end of the TODA. \"commences at the end of the TODA and consists of a 90 m wide corridor along the flight path until the aeroplane reaches 50 ft above any obstacle.\" The obstacle accountability area is not 90 m wide (remember we work in half-widths) and increases in width gradually, and runs until the aircraft has reached 1500 ft.",

Then take away the obstacle height to get an obstacle clearance of: 2476 - 400 = 2076 ft Alternative method (if no formula given) Since all the options are given in ft, the logical thing to do is to convert 4 nm into ft: Distance from runway end = 4 nm x 6080 ft = 24 320 ft Ground Speed = TAS - Headwind Ground Speed = 124 kt - 10 kt = 114 kt TAS/NAM = GS/NGM so NAM = (TAS x NGM) / GS Nautical Air Miles = (124 x 4) / 114 = 4.35 nautical air miles. 4.35 nm x 6080 ft/nm = 26 448 ft 26 448 ft x gradient of 9% = 2380 ft gained Then the same additions as the primary method above, same answer (without rounding errors). To answer a common question, the 0.77 factorisation is not required as this is a single engine piston aircraft in VMC so no actual obstacle clearance requirements apply, and therefore the question is asking only about the expected rate of climb.",

In VFR by day, either could be used for a Part-CAT flight like this. Nonetheless, the options can be very quickly narrowed down. 50 ft is the screen height for class B takeoff, but that is a vertical clearance, not lateral. 25 ft is not a standard number used for any kind of obstacle clearance. 90 m lateral separation until 600 m from DER then 150 m is closer to the standard class A/B lateral obstacle clearance requirements (shown in the annex above), but still not correct, leaving us with the \"see and avoid\" option.

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

A.320: En-route - Single-engined aeroplanes: ENGINE FAILURE: (b) The operator should first increase the scheduled engine-inoperative gliding performance data by 0.5% gradient when verifying the en-route clearance of obstacles and the ability to reach a suitable place for a forced landing. Thus, the en-route glide gradients will be steeper than the gross gradients, by 0.5%. The question asks for the net distance, so we use the net gradient for our calculations. The assumed en-route gradient shall be the gross gradient of descent increased by a gradient of 0.5% (worse than the average gradient), thus giving us a safety margin. So, we use a descent gradient of 11.5%. Using the formulae given, we get: 1. Still air distance = (Height difference x 100) / Net gradient % = [(5 000 ft - 250 ft) x 100] / 11.5 = 41 304 ft or 41 304 ft/6 080 = 6.79 NM.",

Unfortunately there is no published VMD for the Seneca (or for any light twins that I can find) so this can't be checked against VMD. On balance we would choose 'between 90 and 125 kt' as correct",

The forces and moments acting on an aircraft following failure of the left engine are The aircraft has a yawing moment towards the dead engine. The pilot has applied rudder to stop the yaw. The vital action when an engine fails is to stop the yaw. The rolling and yawing moments and the power of the flight controls to balance them will determine the controllability of an aircraft with asymmetric thrust. Rolling and yawing moments with asymmetric thrust are affected by: Thrust on the live engine Altitude Drag from the dead engine and propeller Asymmetric blade effect (also known as ‘P’ Factor) CG position The fore and aft CG location has no effect on the yawing moment from a failed engine, but will influence the rudder arm, hence the rudder moment. CG on the aft limit will give the smallest rudder arm and the least ability to oppose the yawing moment from a failed engine.

            "explanation": "The critical engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing propeller-driven aircraft is the one whose failure would result in the most adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance. When one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust imbalance exists between the operative and inoperative sides of the aircraft. This thrust imbalance causes several negative effects in addition to the loss of one engine's thrust. For reasons listed below, the left engine of a conventional twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft is usually considered critical. Figure : The operating right-hand engine will produce a more severe yaw towards the dead engine, thus making the failure of the left-hand engine critical. Asymmetrical Yaw When one engine becomes inoperative, a torque develops which depends on the lateral distance from the center of gravity (C. G.) to the thrust vector of the operating engine, multiplied by the thrust of the operating engine. The torque effect attempts to yaw the aircraft's nose towards the inoperative engine, a yaw tendency which must be counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls. Due to the asymmetric blade effect (P-factor), the right-hand engine typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's C. G. than the left-hand engine. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa, and it is termed the Critical Engine. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a stronger yaw moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control. Thus, the failure of the critical (left-hand) engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine. It is important to note, however, that this example depends upon both propellers turning clockwise as viewed from the rear. On aircraft with counterclockwise-turning engines (such as the de Havilland Dove), the right engine would be critical. Aircraft which have counter-rotating propellers rotating toward the cockpit on the top side (such as the Beechcraft Duchess) do not have a critical engine, while both engines are critical on aircraft with counter-rotating propellers turning away from the cockpit. The Lockheed P-38 was an example of the latter.",

In simple terms, because there is only one number to use, the factorisation of 1.25 is used for that figure, instead of factorising multiple times for 1, 1.15 and 1.3 (TORA, TODA, ADSA) and choosing the most restrictive. The runway must be now factorised for surface, condition and slope. Using the information from the annex above, the 1% upslope shall reduce the maximum TODR by 5% (factor of 1.05). The surface and condition are one factor for take-off, and for wet grass it is a further 30% reduction in maximum TODR (factor of 1.3) So we start with the actual length of the TORA, TODA and ASDA.

With a rate of climb, you can calculate the gradient of climb in still air using the TAS, or for actual conditions by using the groundspeed. The groundspeed in this case is 99 + 10 = 109 kt.* By doing some conversions, the way to calculate the gradient of climb (%) is by doing the rate of climb (fpm) divided by the groundspeed (kt). It is extremely close to being exact. The slightly more exact method is to use the following formula: Gradient of Climb (%) = (Rate of Climb/Groundspeed) x (6000/6080) Which gives us: Gradient of Climb (%) = (310/109) x (6000/6080) = 2.8% *As the question has asked for the \"one engine flight-path gradient\", we have used actual figures, rather than the regulatory 150% of the tailwind used when planning a departure with regards to obstacle clearance.",

            "explanation": "The Figure 3.1 is used to determine the take-off run (ground roll) and take-off distance applying the following method: Enter where the pressure altitude of 6 000 ft intercepts the ISA TEMP line, and travel horizontally right to the weight reference line. Proceed down the weight reference lines for a single small box to the weight of 4 700 lb. Continue horizontally right to the wind component reference line and move parallel with the grid lines to the wind component 2 kt tailwind. Continue horizontally from the wind component to the ground roll reference line. For the take-off distance continue from the ground roll reference line parallel with the grid lines to read 2 550 ft. This must be factorised for the runway slope, surface and condition: The factorisation for runway upslope is 5% for each 1% slope, so 2.5% slope is a 12.5% correction (multiplier of 1.125) The factorisation for runway surface and condition are combined for an MEP, and is a multiplier of 1.3 for wet grass. The TODR is therefore 2 550 x 1.3 x 1.125 = 3 730 ft, closest answer 3 750 ft. To determine if this is within legal limits from this aerodrome then, we need to compare this TODR figure to a factored version of TORA, TODA and ASDA separately, as per the following requirement. Field Length Requirements When a stopway and/or clearway is available the take-off distance required must: i) not exceed TORA ii) when multiplied by 1.3, not exceed ASDA iii) when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed TODA Consequently, we will have the following distances: i) TORA = 5 000 ft ii) ASDA = 5 400 ft / 1.3 = 4153.8 ft iii) TODA = 6 000 ft / 1.15 = 5217.4 ft Choose the most limiting: 4153.8 ft The TODR is lower than 4153.8 ft, so the take-off performance is within limits.",

Long Dry x 1.2 Wet x 1.3 Paved Wet x 1.0 d) Take-off distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% upslope. No factorisation is permitted for downslope. Therefore, for this question, start with the de-factored take-off distance required, 3700 ft. This must be factored for the 2.5% upslope and the paved, wet runway. The paved, wet runway is a simple 1.0 factor, so there is no change. For the 2.5% upslope, multiply 2.5 by 5 to get 12.5% factorisation. This means we must multiply 3700 x 1.125 = 4162.5 ft. Then, as we are calculating minimum required TODA and the field lengths are unbalanced, we must multiply this figure by 1.15. Minimum TODA required 4162.5 x 1.15 = 4787 ft To put this into context, the minimum required distances available are as follows, TORA = 4162 ft, TODA = 4787 ft, ASDA = 5411 ft. If any distances of the real runway are shorter than these, then it cannot be used.",

CAP 698 – Take-Off Field Length Requirements a) When no stop way or clearway is available [balanced field] the take-off distance when multiplied by 1.25 must not exceed TORA. c) If the runway surface is other than dry and paved the following factors must be used when determining the take-off distance in a) or b) above: Surface type Condition Factor Grass (on firm soil) up to 20 cm. Long Dry x 1.2 Wet x 1.3 Paved Wet x 1.0 d) Take-off distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% upslope.

There is no factorisation required for a wet paved runway There is no factorisation for downslope. Therefore, the total factorisations to the TODA are just to divide by 1.25, giving us the maximum TODR for the graph (unfactored). Maximum TODR (unfactored) 2150 / 1.25 = 1720 ft We can enter the graph with this TODR to give us our FLLTOM, using the pressure altitude, OAT and headwind (remember it is a TODR so 1720 ft to a height of 50 ft).

Thus, the height difference above the power lines is: 424 ft + 50 ft = 474 ft AMSL. Since, the power lines' elevation is 400 ft AMSL, the aircraft will clear the power lines on the extended centre line by: 474 ft - 400 ft = 74 ft.

            "explanation": "For this question, advise the take-off field length requirements on CAP 698 Section 3 - MEP1 p.1,2. An airfield is called as \"unbalanced\", when a stopway and/or a clearway is available. In this case, the take-off distance must: Not exceed TORA When multiplied by 1.3, not exceed ASDA When multiplied by 1.15, not exceed TODA If the runway surface is other than dry and paved, apply the factors referred to the figure, when determining the take-off distance. In this question, the runway is paved and wet, thus, the TODA must be factored down by 1.0, according to the regulations. Also, the TODA must be factored down by 5% or 1,05, due to the 1% runway upslope. Therefore, the defactored TODA that could be used to enter the take-off performance graph for a multi-engined piston aeroplane used for Commercial Air Transport, will be: 4230 ÷ 1.15 ÷ 1.0 ÷ 1.05= 3503 ft",

The pilot is on the single-engine fleet of aircraft, so using that value, it is a factorisation of 1.15. This reduces the aircraft performance, so the landing distance available must be divided by 1.15 to give the corresponding \"wet paved\" runway distance for entry into the performance graphs, making the new value; 3150 / 1.15 = 2739 ft In same way, we can see that the landing performance factored for the downslope. The landing distance increased by 7% for each 1% downslope. For 1.4% downslope → 0.07 x 1.4 = 0.098 → 1.098 factor. So the landing distance available must be divided by 1.098 ⇒ 2739 / 1.098 = 2495 ft The landing distance available can also not be assumed to be fully used by the aircraft on landing. Due to the fact this is a commercial air transport operation, the top paragraph in the annex dictates that only 70% of the LDA can be used for performance calculations, allowing for a safety margin. Therefore, the figure must also be multiplied by 0.7. Therefore, the landing distance to enter into the performance graphs is 2495 ft x 0.7 = 1746 ft",

Move vertically upwards to the aerodrome pressure altitude 1 000 ft. From this point, travel horizontally right to the mass reference line and then parallel with the grid lines to the take-off mass of 3600 lb. Continue horizontally right to the wind component reference line and parallel with the grid lines to the wind component of 10 kt headwind. (This is already factored as part of the graph so the actual wind can be used, no need to half the headwind). Proceed horizontally right to the obstacle reference line then follow the guide lines up to the end of the graph to read off a value of the expected take-off distance (for a dry paved runway) of just over 1900 ft. We now must factorise that for the runway surface, condition, and slope. As given in the question, the factor for dry grass is 1.2, and no slope was mentioned. This will make the take-off performance worse, so needs more runway, and therefore we multiply 1 900 x 1.2 = 2 280 ft. This is the expected take-off distance given the conditions and runway. Finally, as we are trying to get the TODR (Take-off Distance Required) for a Commercial Air Transport flight, we must then factorise this by 1.15. This is because the field is unbalanced, so the take-off distance must*: not exceed the TORA when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed the TODA when multiplied by 1.3, not exceed the ASDA The TODR (and thus the minimum allowable TODA) is therefore 2 280 x 1.15 = 2 622 ft, closest answer 2 700 ft. *This information can all be found in Chapter 2 of CAP 698.",

From this point, travel horizontally right to intercept the \"2 ENGINES\" take-off mass 4 000 lb. Drop vertically to read the all-engine-operating rate of climb 1 830 ft/min. Thus the height gained in 1.24 minutes is: 1 830 ft/min x 1.24 min = 2 269 ft. But according to the question, the all-engines obstacle clearance of a multi-engined aeroplane commences from the end of the take-off with the aircraft at reference zero, i.e. at 50 ft, so the height at the obstacle will be: 2 269 ft + 50 ft = 2 319 ft. Finally, the aircraft will clear the obstacle by: 2 319 ft - 2 000 ft = 319 ft, which is close to 312 ft.",

Thus, the height difference from the aerodrome elevation will be: 27 m + 15 m = 42 m. Since the obstacle's height is 8 m, then the aircraft will clear the obstacle by: 42 m - 8 m = 34 m. Alternatively: The Rate of Climb is given by the formula: RoC = % Climb gradient x TAS = 9% x 60 kt = 540 ft/min. The ground distance until the obstacle will be covered in: Climb time = GD / GS = (250 m / 1 852 m) / (60 kt - 10 kt) = 0.0027 hr or 0.16 min. With a RoC of 540 ft/min the aircraft will gain: 540 ft/min x 0.16 min = 87 ft or 27 m. For a single-engined aeroplane, we assume that the required climb gradient will be achieved at the end of TODA (reference zero) at the screen height of 50ft (15 m). Thus, the height difference from the aerodrome elevation will be: 27 m + 15 m = 42 m. Since the obstacle's height is 8 m, then the aircraft will clear the obstacle by: 42 m - 8 m = 34 m.",

First step: Read the \"corrections\" from the annex and find out the temperature we will use to enter the table. \"Pressure altitude: Increase OAT by 10ºC/1000 ft\". Our OAT is said to be 10ºC, we must add 1 x 10ºC = 10ºC.

Wet landing distances also do not use reverse thrust (but we cannot be as sure about that for all aircraft/operators), and landings on contaminated runways DO include reverse thrust as part of dispatch planning. The question can also be answered by removing incorrect answers. Anti-skid is certainly included in landing distance performance calculations (see the landing distance graph (figure 4.28) in CAP 698), as are ground spoilers. Autobrakes are not included in the landing distance calculation in CAP 698, but they are used in normal operations, so we are happy to say that reverse thrust is the answer.",

Hence there is a theoretical argument for increasing approach speed in heavy rain. On wet/flooded or slush covered runways the tire may hydroplane which reduces the braking forces between the tire and runway significantly. Therefore, in such conditions, a positive (firm, not hard) landing is required to break through the layers of water on the runway, thus minimising the risk of aquaplaning. A \"greaser of a landing\" is most certainly not the answer, because you will only add to the risk of aquaplaning. Furthermore wheel spin-up can be delayed on slippery runways, which affects the proper functioning of the antiskid system and the deployment of ground spoilers. When on the runway, you should apply reverse thrust and lift dumper devices. The lift dumpers are basically ground spoilers that are used to 'dump' lift which, consequently, puts the weight down on the wheels and increases control/braking action.",

However, during a contaminated runway takeoff, the takeoff climb begins at 15 feet instead of 35 feet. The reference zero point is the location on the ground directly below the 35-foot screen. The takeoff climb has two main requirements that must be met in the event of an engine failure at VEF, as engine failure must be accounted for in all flight phases for Class A aircraft. Firstly, the aircraft must be able to achieve the minimum climb gradients, and secondly, it must maintain sufficient obstacle clearance. Summary of some factors that can increase the Climb limited take-off mass, which in turn increases the maximum achievable climb gradient. These factors include: Lower flap setting: Extended flaps or gear beyond their normal retraction points cause additional drag, which reduces excess thrust and takeoff climb performance (which reduces climb gradient). Therefore, a lower flap setting positively affects the Climb limited take-off mass. Higher air density: Air density is typically higher at lower airport elevations, resulting in more thrust being available (depending on the engine). Conversely, lower air density results in a lower climb gradient, leading to a lower Climb limited take-off mass. Lower outside air temperature: Lower temperatures increase air density, which improves climb gradient. This concept is similar to the effect of higher air density at lower airport elevations.",

On the other hand, a tailwind will increase the LDR by increasing the aircraft's groundspeed. The effectiveness of the brakes depends partly on the friction between the tyres and the runway. Water on the runway surface causes poor braking action and may also lead to hydroplaning, both of which increase the LDR. For this question, we assume that the planned LDR is equal to the aerodrome's LDA. Thus, since the LDR cannot be further increased, the new conditions forces the pilot to reduce the Maximum Landing Mass so as to remain within the aircraft's performnce limits.",

To achieve this, we deploy high lift devices such as slats and flaps, which will reduce the stall speed. Once the aircraft is on the ground, the retarding forces are drag, braking and reverse thrust. The speed on the approach is not less than the landing reference speed VREF, but is often slightly higher, reducing to VREF at the screen height. The landing begins from the point where the aircraft crosses the threshold, until it comes to a rest and it is split into the landing airborne distance and the landing ground run (roll). Increased VREF, means a significant increase in the kinetic energy given by the following formula, since the speed is squared: Kinetic Energy = ½ M V2. As a consequence, an increased speed and kinetic energy, during the approach and landing phase, will increase the total landing distance, both the airborne distance and the ground run, but depending on the braking action it may stop within the LDA. For instance, a 10% increase in the VREF speed, may result in a 20% increase of the landing distance, assuming a normal flare and touchdown. Also, crossing the threshold higher than recommended (at 100 ft instead of 50 ft) means that the touchdown point will be further than expected, thus increasing the airborne landing distance and as a result increasing the total landing distance, but depending on the braking action it may stop within the LDA. Therefore, either crossing the threshold higher or faster than recommended, the landing distance will increase, but depending on the braking action the aircraft may stop within the LDA.",

The range of speeds (margin) between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: Higher aircraft weight - As the aircraft mass increases, the low speed buffet increases and the high speed buffet decreases. Higher altitude - As the aircraft climbs higher, the low speed buffet increases and the high speed buffet decreases. At the max altitude, there will be one available speed only (coffin corner). Higher load factor - lift increases, so low speed buffet increases and high speed buffet decreases (due to faster airflow over the wing). More forward CG position - lift increases due to elevator downforce, same effect as above. A climb will increase the altitude even further, and will be putting the aircraft even further into \"coffin corner\". We do not fly aircraft higher than the 1.3 G buffett boundary limit, as 1.3 G is a safe margin in order to conduct up to 40º bank angle turns (though that much bank angle would be silly). We must therefore tell ATC that we are unable to climb due to performance. Note: The question does mention a turn at 45º angle of bank. This would cause a stall at this height (and be illegal to do under IFR anyway), so is ridiculous, but is either wrongly fed back or is badly worded from the examiner, who is trying to get accross that we really cannot afford to climb any further.",

V2 is the minimum speed that needs to be maintained up to acceleration altitude, in the event of an engine failure after V1. VMC is not affected by weight in straight and level flight, only by the weight of the airplane in a bank. When it is banked, a component of the aircraft weight acts along with the horizontal component of lift to create a more effective sideslip towards the operating engine. So for a given bank, the heavier the airplane, the lower the aircraft’s VMC. The lighter the airplane, the higher the aircraft’s VMC. However, it is affected by density altitude due to the asymmetric engine thrust – which increases with air density (low altitudes, temperatures and humidity). Based on this, VMC limit is likely a controlling factor at low density altitudes and low aircraft weights (where 1.13 VSR limit is lower). Based on this at high density altitudes with high weight V2MIN is likely to be limited by VSR.",

The lowest fuel flow will give us the greatest airborne time, called as maximum endurance. This means that the speed for jet maximum endurance is VMD.

Using this as an example, the Obstacle-Limited TOM will be more restrictive when: The obstacles are higher than the net flight path that you would get with the minimum air gradient of 2.4%. So, a greater climb gradient will be required to clear the obstacles by the required margin in this case. A tailwind makes the minimum climb air gradient a lower climb ground gradient, increasing the chance of the above.

Please let us know if you see this in the exam, thank you! Learning Objective 032.04.01.10.04: Describe why data from an EFB can differ from data derived from RTOM tables or similar. EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) means any portable electronic device for use by the flight crew, which may be a laptop, a tablet or an integrated device within the flight deck. Many EFBs include commercial navigation packages, enabling the whole flight to be planned and executed on the same device. It may also hold charts and AFMs and are widely used in an effort to reduce the amount of paper flying around a cockpit. It is very common to use software on the EFB to make performance calculations, as the software is easier to use, more accurate, and much faster than manually going through the paper charts and tables. The reason the EFB produced performance figures may be slightly different from those from the charts are mostly down to accuracy. When using paper charts and tables, interpolation has to be done, and the charts can sometimes be difficult to follow with high accuracy, so they are then made with slightly conservative figures, and the operator is not able to interpret them to the same accuracy as the EFB software can interpret its own data, creating slight inconsistencies between the two sources.",

We believe this question is quite on the edge, and not only strays quite far from the learning objectives, but also has some questionable wording. We have combined the feedback to make a somewhat answerable question. Please let us know if you see this in the exam, and anything you can remember from it, thank you! A balanced field is where the TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) is the same as the ASDA (Accelerate-Stop Distance Available). This occurs when a runway has no stopway/clearway, or the stopway and clearway are the same length. This allows the \"best use of space\" for takeoff performance, in that a balanced runway of 2000 m will allow a higher FLLTOM (Field-Length Limited Take-Off Mass) than an 1800 m runway with a 200 m stopway, for instance. Still 2000m being used, but the stopway on its own is \"less useful\". This question makes a lot of the windshear scenario here, but that is just a way to ask us how the performance calculation changes based on full thrust versus a reduced thrust take-off. We could dive into the possible reasons for all the different values of TOD, ASD, etc., but without extensive information about the airport, conditions and aircraft, it would all be speculation. Lets consider each option: \"both take-offs have the same ratio between the TOD and the ASD as this will always give an optimum performance on a balanced field runway.\" This is clearly incorrect. If you calculate the ratios of the ASD to the TOD for each case, you will see they are very different. \"the TOGA take-off uses the principle of a balanced field take-off, as this gives the best relationship between distances and weight.\" We believe this is the most correct. If you assume that the ASD and TOD are effectively the same (13 m apart is very little, and this is considered the same, as computer performance tools almost always produce a small split like this), then this is correct, as a balanced field does give the best FLLTOM for a given distance (as mentioned above), and therefore the best safety margin when not at FLLTOM. \"both take-offs use the principle of an unbalanced field take-off since the all-engine, engine-out, and accelerate-stop distances are different.\" Whilst this looks appealing as an answer, the TOGA takeoff has an ASD and TOD that are so close they are effectively the same, and even discounting that, the all-engine TOD would not be expected to align with the engine out TOD/ASD, balanced or unbalanced field, so the explanation in this option is wrong. \"the take-off using assumed (FLEX) temperature method is based on having the fastest possible V1 as the ASD uses the entire runway length.\" The fastest possible V1 is usually not desirable. Also, there will not be a range of V1s available for that takeoff thrust setting, as it is using a reduced thrust, so the performance is therefore right on the limit.",

And for Class A airctaft it is the highest of: 1.13 VSR 1.10 VMCA VR plus the speed increment before reaching at 35 ft. The effect of combining the above limits is to produce a V2MIN that is often constant at light weights and increases with weight. V2MIN as an airspeed is affected by the air density (pressure altitude and temperature). At high air density airport engine thrust would be higher, therefore in case of engine failure the effect of assymetric thrust is more pronounced. This increase VMCA which would increase V2MIN too. Thus, high air density ambient conditions (low temperature and/or low pressure altitude) will result in an increased V2MIN.",

You can do this in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Learning Objective 032.04.01.01.08: Explain how loss of TORA due to alignment is accounted for. EASA AMC1 CAT. POL. A.205 - Take-off LOSS OF RUNWAY LENGTH DUE TO ALIGNMENT (a) The length of the runway that is declared for the calculation of take-off distance available (TODA), accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA) and take-off run available (TORA) does not account for line-up of the aeroplane in the direction of take-off on the runway in use. This alignment distance depends on the aeroplane geometry and access possibility to the runway in use. Accountability is usually required for a 90°-taxiway entry to the runway and 180°-turnaround on the runway. There are two distances to be considered: (1) the minimum distance of the main wheels from the start of the runway for determining TODA and TORA,’L’; and (2) the minimum distance of the most forward wheel(s) from the start of the runway for determining ASDA,’N’. Where the aeroplane manufacturer does not provide the appropriate data, the calculation method given in (b) should be used to determine the alignment distance. The AMC (Acceptable Means of Compliance) is not hugely specific about the scenarios when this is required, but adding a bit of common sense leads it to be used any time the aircraft lines up on the runway, other than when they can be fully lined up at the start of the runway threshold. Thankfully, there is only one option close to this, and the other options are all flawed or unrelated in some way.",

There is no point in taking-off with the maximum take-off thrust set, when clearly this is unnecessary. Any thrust setting, less than the maximum, will provide substantial benefits in terms of engine life, maintenance and operating costs. In such cases, it is normal for operators to use approved procedures to reduce the thrust, so that the aircraft is at or close to its performance limits at the reduced thrust setting. There are two different procedured that operators may follow: The \"Flex take-off\" or \"Reduced thrust take-off\" or \"Asssumed temperature take-off\" and The \"Derated thrust take-off\" The Flex take-off is achieved by calculating an assumed or “flex” temperature that is higher than the ambient, which, when entered into the FMS, will give a thrust setting lower than the full thrust. The flex temperature will always be higher than the ambient temperature and if done correctly the aircraft will perform at or close to its minimum performance requirements at the reduced thrust setting in the event of an engine failure. On a Flex take-off, Take-Off/Go Around (TOGA) thrust can be applied, if required, at any stage of the take-off, because the control speeds, VMCG and VMCA are based on that maximum thrust value and must be correct for full thrust, not for a reduced setting. Thus, the result of using a TOGA setting, instead of a FLEX setting, will be an improved performance.",

EFB means any portable electronic device for use by the flight crew, which may be a laptop, a tablet or an integrated device within the flight deck. Many EFBs include commercial navigation packages, enabling the whole flight to be planned and executed on the same device. It may also hold charts and AFMs and are widely used in an effort to reduce the amount of paper flying around a cockpit. An RTOW table is produced for a specific aircraft type on a particular runway and shows the MTOM and speeds for a variety of temperatures and pressure altitudes, sometimes giving different configuration options. If the ambient temperature and wind conditions do not fall on a discrete column or row, the FCOM will advise whether interpolating is required or whether the pilot should choose the more conservative data points, not interpolate, and accept a slight performance penalty. Comparing EFBs with RTOW tables, EFBs are more accurate because a computer is able to consider more accurate parameters and apply these without interpolation. Airbus estimates that use of the EFB allows between 300 kg and 1 200 kg of additional payload when compared to paper-based calculations from RTOW tables, because of the conservative corrections within the RTOW for temperature, wind and minor unserviceabilities.",

This has very low friction, so the tyre will have no traction available to applying braking force, the wheel will \"lock up\" and the tyre will just skid on a \"wedge of water\". Hydroplaning occurs differently whether the tyres are spinning or not, and the speed it occurs at is governed by the following two formulas. Tyres are not spinning when the aircraft touches down, hence the increased risk of hydroplaning during landing, rather than during a rejected take-off, which is the other time it could cause problems. (non-rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 7.7 x √(tyre pressure (psi)) (rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 9 x √(tyre pressure (psi)) Therefore the hydroplaning speed is lower for non-rotating wheels, meaning that they are more sensitive to hydroplaning.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is a highly requested modification of Q323946, with much more detail in the question, as seen recently in exams. When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the biggest factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. This is called our RTOM (regulated take-off mass), and is the most limiting of our climb limited take-off mass (CLTOM), obstacle limited take-off mass (OLTOM), field length limiting take-off mass (FLLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance, so if we have a long runway surrounded by mountains, then we will likely be limited by the obstacle limited take-off mass, as its value will be lower than all the others. The questions asks for which configuration we should choose in this scenario. Using more flaps for take-off decreases our take-off distance, as we can rotate and lift off at a slower speed, but also decreases or climb gradient. Increasing the amount of flaps therefore increases our FLLTOM, but decreases our OLTOM and CLTOM. In this question, we have a short runway and very low required climb gradient. Therefore the FLLTOM will be the most limiting, and to increase this, we would take-off with a higher flap setting. This stands to reason, as we would rotate at a lower speed to use less runway (good for the short runway), but then have quite a poor climb gradient relative to using less flaps, which is no problem over the sea. Therefore, we should choose Configuration 3.",

A lower SFC leads to the aircraft being able to obtain a higher specific range (SR), which is the distance covered per unit of fuel burnt (higher is better). In a turbojet engine, SFC is lowest (which is best) when the air temperature is low, and also when the engine is running at its design RPM of approximately 90 to 95% rpm. It also means that the engine-aircraft combination is most efficient at high altitude where the air is cold and the thrust required to overcome drag is approximately 90 to 95% of the thrust available. This creates an optimum altitude for a turbojet powered aircraft. Flying at this altitude allows the specific range of the aircraft to be the highest By decreasing an aircraft's weight (which happens due to fuel burn throughout flight normally), the aircraft has lower induced drag and larger buffet margins, so can safely climb higher. This means that the optimum altitude of the aircraft will increase also. This means lower temperatures (which decrease SFC) and a higher TAS for the same drag, so specific range is increased also.",

We therefore require any further exam feedback about this one. Please send feedback to us via the comments, the exam feedback section on your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the biggest factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. This is called our MATOM (maximum allowed take-off mass), and is the most limiting of our climb limited take-off mass (CLTOM), obstacle limited take-off mass (OLTOM), field length limiting take-off mass (FLLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance, so if we have a long runway surrounded by mountains, then we will likely be limited by the obstacle limited take-off mass, as its value will be lower than all the others. In this question, then, we can say that statement 1 is incorrect, as that is only comparing OLTOM to CLTOM, but the OLTOM is only limiting if it is the lowest of all those masses mentioned above. Statement 2 requires a little more thought. When we calculate OLTOM, we are allowed to include the wind effects, as a headwind will allow us a steeper climb gradient than in still air (and shallower with a tailwind). We are, however, only allowed to use up to 50% of the headwind component, and not less than 150% of the tailwind, to give a safety margin. This means that we underestimate the effect of a headwind on our obstacle clearance, so statement 2 is incorrect.",

Bleed air is a pneumatic source in an aircraft, used for processes such as pressurisation, air conditioning, de-icing/anti-icing, etc. It is usually taken from the compressor stage of the engines, and therefore reduces the amount of air that gets sent to the combustion chamber for ignition. Bleed air is also used for starting the engines, and for the first engine to be started, it is either taken from the APU (auxiliary power unit) bleed air supply or from a pneumatic GPU (ground power unit). APUs are small turbine engines in the tail of large jets that provide extra power and bleed air for operations, usually when on the ground with the main engines off. This means that \"bleeds\", as they are commonly called, do decrease engine thrust, due to reduced mass flow. It is not a large decrease, but it is enough that operators sometimes require the bleeds to be switched off for performance critical take-offs to provide the best possible thrust. In this scenario, however, the APU is providing all the bleed air supplies for the aircraft, meaning that the main engine thrust will be increased from usual, and therefore take-off performance will be improved. It is assumed that aircraft usually take-off with engine bleed air on, unless the extra performance is required.",

Flying higher or lower than the optimum altitude will decrease the range of the airplane. It is important to understand that the optimum altitude is not fixed. As the weight decreases through fuel burn, the drag curve moves down and left. Therefore, the best range speed, 1.32VMD, falls and the total drag decreases. With decreasing weight, the airplane needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. As it does so, the Mach number will also decrease meaning that the airplane is not limited by the high Mach number and corresponding high drag. This fact allows the airplane to climb a little. As the airplane climbs, the Mach number will increase again to its previous limiting value and drag will increase back to its previous value. But more importantly the higher altitude has decreased the specific fuel consumption. This means that over time, as the weight decreases with fuel burn, the optimum altitude increases.",

The above graph shows that there is greater excess drag at high speed than at low speeds. The steepest angle of descent is achieved by staying fast. To achieve a maximum rate of descent, both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path should be as large as possible. The situation described in the question will lead to a descent with constant Mach selected, which in turn will force an increase in TAS. As stated above, an increase in TAS results in an increase in both the angle and rate of descent. And in this case, it means that the pitch angle decreases.",

            "explanation": "When a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure several variables affect both the yawing moment and the rudder moment which is used to oppose it. There is a minimum IAS (VMC), below which it is impossible for the pilot to maintain directional control with asymmetric thrust. Airworthiness Authorities, in this case the EASA, have laid down conditions which must be satisfied when establishing the minimum airspeeds for inclusion in the Flight Manual of a new aircraft type. As in most other cases, the conditions under which the minimum control airspeeds are established are ‘worst case’. VMC is affected by the amount of thrust being developed by the operating engine. As altitude and/or temperature increases, the thrust from an unsupercharged engine will decrease. In conditions of high air density, the engines produce a high thrust output and the loss of the output from one engine during take-off is a proportionate loss of a high output. This will require a considerable amount of force to counteract the tendency to yaw. VMC increases with increasing density. Air density will be highest when the aerodrome pressure altitude is lowest (high atmospheric pressure), the air temperature is lowest and the water-vapour content of the air is lowest. Considering a descent at constant speed and flying initially at VMC, as the aircraft descends, VMC increases, leading to flight at a speed lower than VMC at lower altitudes. This can be potentially dangerous as the aircraft becomes uncontrollable below VMC. LO 032.04.05.01.02: Explain the effect of descending at constant IAS.",

Alternatively, The wind velocity is made of two components, one acting along the runway called the headwind component, and the other acting across the runway called the crosswind component. It is possible to calculate the crosswind component taking the sine and the cosine of the relative bearing between the runway and the wind direction. Head/Tail wind component = Wind Speed x cosine (Relative Bearing) Head/Tail wind component = 30 x cosine (50º) = 19 kts Crosswind component = Wind Speed x sine (Relative Bearing) Crosswind component = 30 x sine (50º) = 23 kts",

At cruise altitudes, the attempt to maintain height usually fails, because of inadequate thrust on the remaining engine(s) and the aircraft will descend down to a height at which it is able to stabilise. This is called \"driftdown\" and it is a \"power on\" descent. The driftdown is flown at the best angle of descent speed, which is VMD and is also the best angle of climb speed for a jet, Vx. Also, the greatest excess thrust is found at VMD and it minimizes the descent angle, not the Rate of Descent (ROD). The lowest ROD is achieved at VMP. A deceleration to VMD at FL350, will create a nose-up attitude and will delay for some seconds the commencement of the descent, improving that way the obstacle clearance. Thus, the Obstacle strategy, where the cruise speed M0.78 (262 kt CAS) is reduced to the Minimum drag speed VMD (241 kt CAS) before commencing the descent, improves the obstacle clearance.",

For instance, look at the ASD line (Accelerate-Stop Distance). It shows that, with a low speed V1, the ASD is short, and when the V1 increases, so does the accelerate-stop distance. This stands to reason, as the faster we get to before we stop, the longer our total distance is going to be. The TODN-1 and TORN-1 lines are the opposite, as they correspond to how long the take-off distance and take-off run will be in an engine failure scenario. With a lower V1, they are both long distances, as the aircraft will have to accelerate most of the way up to rotate speed on only 1 engine. As the V1 increases, they both decrease in distance. The TODN and TORN lines are fixed at a certain distance, and do not vary due to V1, as those scenarios do not change at V1 at all. The balanced V1 exists when the ASD is equal to the TODN-1, meaning that for a balanced field runway, there is one perfect V1, which allows the absolute maximum possible mass, and there are no wasted safety margins. The aircraft will use the same distance to stop as it would do to reach screen height from that exact V1 speed. Even if the aircraft is not taking off at this maximum mass (called the FLLTOM), the balanced V1 is usually used anyway to provide equivalent safety margins in both the stop and go scenarios.",

Flying higher or lower than the optimum altitude will decrease the range of the airplane. It is important to understand that the optimum altitude is not fixed. As the weight decreases through fuel burn, the drag curve moves down and left. Therefore, the best range speed, 1.32VMD, falls and the total drag decreases. With decreasing weight, the airplane needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. As it does so, the Mach number will also decrease meaning that the airplane is not limited by the high Mach number and corresponding high drag. This fact allows the airplane to climb a little. As the airplane climbs, the Mach number will increase again to its previous limiting value and drag will increase back to its previous value. But more importantly the higher altitude has decreased the specific fuel consumption. This means that over time, as the weight decreases with fuel burn, the optimum altitude increases.",

When a rotation is made slower, the aircraft spends longer in contact with the runway (and therefore has an increased take-off run), and also spends longer reaching the correct attitude, and therefore does not climb as well during the rotation and climb to 35ft screen height. This increases the take-off distance (to get to 35 ft) and may reduce the obstacle clearance margin with close in obstacles. It will increase the initial climb speed of the aircraft slightly, but we cannot say if this will continue into the climb out, as the pilot may pitch to a higher attitude to compensate for the extra speed. Also, the examiner has framed this slower rotation as less effective for takeoff, so the correct answer would usually have a worse result than the normal rotation rate, and therefore the \"increased V2\" option is not the most correct option in our opinion.",

            "explanation": "A reduced thrust take-off is a take-off that is accomplished utilising less thrust than the engines are capable of producing under the existing conditions of temperature and pressure altitude. The procedure can be used any time the actual take-off mass is less than the maximum permissible take-off mass and there is an available take-off distance that greatly exceeds that which is required. It has some other restrictions as well, such as not being used on a contaminated runway, or if reversers are unavailable, etc. It is used to reduce engine wear and increase engine lifespan. The limitation is posed on the engine computer by inputting a flexible thrust temperature (FLEX) for the engine, which essentially tells the engine computer an artificial outside air temperature that is higher than the actual temperature. This way the engine computer believes that the entering air is hotter than it really is. At outside air temperatures above the flat rated temperature, there is a specific thrust value (variable by pressure altitude) for each temperature, which reduces as the temperature increases, so as not to exceed the engine's maximum TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature). If the thrust requirement for the take-off is known, the associated temperature at which this thrust would be produced can be extracted from the applicable charts. This \"assumed\" temperature is then entered into the FMS, making the engines think that they can only produce a certain amount of thrust. The pilot can then use that amount of thrust for take-off, or they can use TO/GA (Take-Off/Go-Around) thrust instead, and the engine would revert back to using the maximum thrust for the actual outside air temperature. This would cause an increased thrust output, and would lead to better take-off performance. That is what this question is referring to when it says \"using the actual OAT instead of the FLEX temperature\".",

On a wet runway, the screen height is reduced to 15'. Operating engines are at takeoff thrust, the flaps/slats are in takeoff configuration and landing gear retraction is initiated once safely airborne with positive climb. The first segment ends when the landing gear is fully retracted. Begins when the landing gear is fully retracted. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the flaps/slats are in the takeoff configuration. This segment ends at the higher of 400'. Begins at 400' or higher specified acceleration altitude. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the aircraft is accelerated in level flight. Slats/flaps are retracted on speed. The segment ends when aircraft is in clean configuration and the final take-off speed has been achieved. Once this has happened, thrust can be reduced from maximum take-off thrust, TOGA, to maximum continuous thrust, MCT. Starts when the flaps are retracted, the final segment speed is achieved, and the thrust is set to maximum continuous thrust. From this point the airplane is climbed to above 1500 ft where the take-off flight path ends. Each segment of the one engine inoperative takeoff flight path has a mandated climb gross gradient requirement. To ensure obstacle clearance while allowing for aircraft performance degradation and less than optimum pilot technique, the gross gradients are reduced by a safety factor. The net gradient is the gross gradient reduced by: 0.8% for 2-engine aircraft 0.9% for 3-engine aircraft 1.0% for 4-engine aircraft Using the net gradient instead of the gross gradient in the take-off flight path will produce a net take-off flight path.

The approach type (ILS, visual approach, VOR/DME, RNP, etc.) makes no difference in general to the landing performance. \"Runway type, type of contamination, pilot-reported braking action.\" Yes, yes, no. This is debatable, but the pilot-reported braking action is good to account for in terms of airmanship, but it is not really used for the landing performanc calculation, however it should inform an airport authority to check the runway again and perhaps change the contamination code or report. For the purposes of this question, it is incorrect. \"Runway width, wet or dry, tyre type.\" Runway width affects some elements of landing such as crosswind limitations, but not performance, so incorrect. \"Aircraft weight, wind conditions, runway length.\" Correct. These are some of the biggest factors, and all 3 must be accounted for on every landing.",

When taking-off or landing on a sloping runway, a component of weight will act along the longitudinal axis of the airplane. This will either augment thrust, or augment drag which will increase or decrease the accelerating force. When the aircraft is on a downslope, the weight component will act in the direction of thrust => adding forward force. As a result, deceleration decreases which increases landing distance and decreases take-off distance. Whereas, on an upslope situation, the component of weight acts in the direction of drag (backwards along the longitudinal axis). This will result in a reduced acceleration force and, consequently, decreased landing distance and increased take-off distance. When departing from a runway with a downslope, the procedure is to decrease V1 slightly => With a downslope the acceleration of the aircraft is better, however it will not help us stopping if an engine fails before V1. \"reduces take off distance required (TODR)\" CORRECT. Take off distance - a down slope allows the aircraft to accelerate faster which decreases the take of distance \"reduces V1\" CORRECT. When departing from a runway with a downslope, the procedure is to decrease V1 slightly => With a downslope the acceleration of the aircraft is better, however it will not help us stopping if an engine fails before V1. For this reason, reduction of V1 shortens the acceleration segment and gives more safety margin for stopping.",

Likewise, when the ASDA and TODA are different lengths, this is known as an Unbalanced Field Length. BALANCED FIELD TAKE-OFF A balanced field take-off is performance based and is a condition where the Accelerate-stop Distance Required (ASDR) is equal to the Take-off Distance Required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field take-off can be performed. A Balanced field length is used to simplify the field-length take-off mass. When applying this concept, TOD = ASD and V1 = V1 Balanced. And this means that we are using the minimum requirements in case of engine failure, thus increasing safety margins. When using stopway or clearway, extra distance will be available and V1 will vary. BALANCED V1 The first graph on the attached figure, helps understanding the impact of increasing or decreasing V1. Analyzing it, we can conclude the following: A Balanced V1 is a V1 speed which results in TODR equal to ASDR. Often called the “Ideal V1” as it gives the minimum field length required for a given weight and optimum performance. Any lower V1 (V1 < V1B) would increase TODR, as it would take longer for the aircraft to accelerate to V2 with OEI. As a result, the total field required increases. Any higher V1 (V1 > V1B) would increase ASDR due to a higher energy absorption by the brakes. As a result, the total field required would also increase. => In essence, Balanced V1 improves field length limited take-off performance. => Unbalanced V1 allows for higher take-off weights by taking advantage of any runway and clearway or stopway available in excess of balanced field length. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

Climbing with a speed closer to the best angle of climb greatly enhance the climb performance.

In very simplified terms => anti-skid system provides the greatest possible brake pressure while not allowing the wheels to lock due to an excessive brake pressure being applied. Without the anti-skid system (manual braking) the braking effectiveness is reduced. With the anti-skid system inoperative we have to consider not only the brake effectiveness for landing (landing distance increases), but also the accelerate-stop distance for the take-off in case of engine failure before V1 => with anti-skid inop the accelerate-stop distance increases.",

            "explanation": "The optimum flight profile for a jet aircraft requires a climb after take-off to the optimum altitude. Once you have achieved your initial optimum cruise altitude, flying at 1.32 VMD (best range speed for jet aircraft) and with the engines at around 90% RPM, the fuel burn will reduce the aircraft weight. As the weight decreases, both VMD and the induced drag decrease. This means that in level flight, 90% thrust will accelerate you beyond 1.32 VMD, in effect your optimum altitude has increased. In order to avoid this, the aircraft can be put into either a cruise climb or step climb. Air Traffic Control probably will not allow a cruise climb, because it is a very very slow climb during cruise, so that the aircraft is always at the optimum altitude, where 90% RPM always gives the best range speed. The step climb is the most common way of operating jets in the cruise in real life. It is a compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb, where the aircraft initially climbs to the nearest level and reaches a little above the optimum altitude and then fly level for a while, reducing thrust as the weight reduces to maintain the best range speed. As the weight reduces, the optimum level rises through your level and then, when the aircraft is 1 000 ft to 2 000 ft below the optimum altitude, you can climb again to the next ATC-approved level available above the optimum and so on.",

A higher density altitude therefore means having a lower maximum landing mass (MLM). Compared to an airfield at sea level, the high field elevation, low pressure systems and high temperatures decrease the air density, which causes a higher TAS for the same IAS, and means that an aircraft will cross the threshold at a higher groundspeed on landing, and will therefore take a longer distance to decelerate from that higher speed.

            "explanation": "VMC is the lowest speed, at which the aircraft can maintain directional control with one engine inoperative. It is called the minimum control speed. There are two types, VMCG and VMCA, for control on the ground and in the air respectively (though specific definitions do exist for each, and there are also take-off climb and landing climb variants). If the question mentions VMC without specifying which type, you would usually assume VMCA, but in many cases it is the same answer regardless. VMCG is the lowest speed that the rudder is effective enough to counteract a sudden engine failure on take-off, and VMCA is the lowest speed where the rudder has enough authority in flight to keep the heading stable without banking after an engine failure. The major factor that affects VMC is the difference in engine thrust. VMC will therefore be lower at higher airport elevations and at a higher OAT, due to the associated lower thrust. If conditions are hot, high and humid the air is less dense. This reduces thrust and, consequently, when you lose the critical engine on take-off, there is less yawing moment from asymmetric thrust than there would be in denser air. It is effectively the only thing that \"poor performance\" is useful for. The less thrust, the smaller the asymmetry, the lower the VMC.",

Please let us know what you can remember from the exam if you see this, thank you! VMCG is defined as \"the minimum CAS on the take-off run at which, on failure of the critical engine and with the remaining engine(s) at maximum take-off power, the pilot can retain control of the aircraft using the primary aerodynamic controls alone.\" After an engine failure during take-off, if the decision is made to continue the take-off, then the asymmetric thrust will force the aircraft off the runway centre line. The pilot will try to keep the aircraft straight with rudder application, producing an aerodynamic force. The rudder effectiveness increases with forward speed. Below the minimum control speed on the ground, VMCG, the aircraft cannot be kept straight. VEF (engine failure speed), therefore, must be greater than or equal to VMCG and as V1 is greater than VEF, it follows that V1 must be greater than VMCG. If V1 is less than VMCG, then the aircraft will not be able to be kept straight on the runway, if a \"go\" decision is made. If a range of decision speeds exists, that encompasses the VMCG as the highest speed which can be chosen to satisfy the requirement. If not, the TOM must be reduced until the range of speeds just encompasses VMCG and then V1 is set equal to VMCG. This creates a VMCG limited take-off mass. In most cases VMCG intrudes only on to the lowest decision speeds of a range. If this is the case, the speeds in the range below VMCG cannot be used. VMCG is most likely to be limiting where the asymmetric thrust is greatest: At low pressure altitudes At low temperature conditions At low humidity At short runways, leading to low values of V1, being derived from the One-Engine-Inoperative Field-Length-Limited calculation. The other options are incorrect because: A) VR cannot be less than 1.05 x VMC so can never be less than VMC. B) VR being the same as V2 would mean that no speed is expected to be gained between rotation and reaching 35 ft, which is very unlikely, particularly in these high power output conditions. C) Looking at the CS-25 regulations, the V2min and V2 are not legally limited by VLOF at all. The only time they could be technically limited by it is if the VLOF was too high to allow the V2 to be reached by screen height, which would not be the case on a high performance day such as this one (and it is debatable whether it would ever be able to happen at all)",

As a result, if flown at a higher or lower pressure altitude than the optimum altitude will decrease the aircraft range. The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases. However, for a number of reasons, ATC will probably not allow a cruise climb. The compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb is a step climb. STEP CLIMB means that the airplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum altitude and levels off. As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a point where it is again 2000 ft above the airplane’s current level. And thereafter the climb process can be repeated. This is the most common way of operating jets in real life. The pilot should always aim to use the step climb technique to remain as close as possible to the optimum altitude. However, it can be beneficial to fly at an altitude other than the optimum altitude in case of, for example, significant tailwind at a different level - even if it means flying significantly below the Optimum Altitude. Or when experiencing severe turbulence at the Optimum Altitude.",

Due to increased lift, induced drag also increases producing greater drag, this in turn increases total drag.

Please let us know if you receive a similar question to this in the exam, the wording and the answer, thank you! As our aircraft has been using more fuel than expected, we want to conserve it over the rest of the flight, to make sure our reserves remain intact, and so that we do not have to divert. To do this, we would usually slow down and fly at the ECON (economy) speed, but ATC have asked us to descend at high speed. This is an odd request, but not unheard of. We could expedite our descent the most by descending at MMO/VMO but this would be very innefficient, and we would lose a lot of energy to drag unnnecessarily. In this case, we can choose to fly at LRC (Long Range Cruise). It is faster than ECON, but with not much more fuel burn. It means that we can both conserve fuel and obey ATC's request.",

Then you have to check each answer to decide which one fits the statement fully. We will now analyse each possible answer and find the most correct one. When buffet becomes noticeable, it will probably be so severe that the pilot will NOT be able to read the instruments or to control the aeroplane. The statement does not mention that all buffet is severe buffet. Light buffet is possible also, and is easy to correct, with no lasting damage, so this is incorrect. The aeroplane has entered an undesired state if high-speed buffet becomes perceptible and recovery from this may be impossible. Again, a small amount of high-speed buffet is easy to handle and is definitely recoverable. Only severe buffet is undesirable and potentially unrecoverable, again, incorrect. NO high-speed buffet will occur at any speed up to VMO/MMO, unless the aeroplane is approaching the stall. The statement specified that there may be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise configuration in straight flight at any speed up to VMO/MMO (other than stall buffet). It only specifies straight flight though; and does not stop high-speed buffet during manoeuvres within this speed range. Therefore, buffet is possible within the speed range and this answer is incorrect. High-speed buffet may occur at speeds around VMO/MMO during manoeuvres away from straight flight. This is true; as said previously, there is no part of the statement that disallows high-speed buffet during manoeuvres, so it can occur.",

Variation of TAS with Altitude at a Constant Mach Number Mach no. = TAS ÷ LSS then, TAS = Mach no. x LSS As altitude increases the temperature drops, local speed of sound decreases and therefore TAS decreases up to the tropopause, where the temperature remains the same with altitude, so the TAS then remains constant (parallel to the Mach No.). As altitude decreases the temperature will rise, local speed of sound will increase and TAS will increase. When we climb an aircraft, initially we maintain a constant IAS/CAS, and with decreasing air density this leads to TAS increasing steadily, but at the cross-over altitude (depicted as FL270 in the figure), we then change to maintaining a constant Mach No., which means our IAS/CAS reduces steadily, and our TAS decreases also. This happens until the tropopause is reached, when the temperature stops changing with altitude, and the TAS then remains constant.",

            "explanation": "The optimum flight profile for a jet aircraft requires a climb after take-off to the optimum altitude. Once you have achieved your initial optimum cruise altitude, flying at 1.32 VMD (best range speed for jet aircraft) and with the engines at around 90% RPM, the fuel burn will reduce the aircraft weight. As the weight decreases, both VMD and the induced drag decrease. This means that in level flight, 90% thrust will accelerate you beyond 1.32 VMD, in effect your optimum altitude has increased. In order to avoid this, the aircraft can be put into either a cruise climb or step climb. Air Traffic Control probably will not allow a cruise climb, because it is a very very slow climb during cruise, so that the aircraft is always at the optimum altitude, where 90% RPM always gives the best range speed. The step climb is the most common way of operating jets in the cruise in real life. It is a compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb, where the aircraft initially climbs to the nearest level and reaches a little above the optimum altitude and then fly level for a while, reducing thrust as the weight reduces to maintain the best range speed. As the weight reduces, the optimum level rises through your level and then, when the aircraft is 1 000 ft to 2 000 ft below the optimum altitude, you can climb again to the next ATC-approved level available above the optimum and so on.",

VSR is the reference stall speed of an aircraft. It is a figure provided by the manufacturer that can be used to work out speeds such as VREF, VR, V2, etc. It cannot be less than the VS1G speed. It can be split into VSR1 and VSR0. VSR1 is the reference stall speed in a particular configuration (so can have many different values, depending on configuration), whereas VSR0 is the reference stall speed in the landing configuration. VS1G is the speed at which the aircraft reaches the CLMAX with the lift equal to the aircraft weight (load factor of 1). Even though the reference stall speed is not formally defined by a particular condition, we can see from the information above that VSR0 is a speed at or above the speed an aircraft reaches CLMAX in the landing configuration with a load factor equal to 1 (or greater than 1 even, but that would be an unusual case).

            "explanation": "This appears to be a common topic of questions, with two other questions (323946 and 328175 both contain similar situations, but asking different questions about it). When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the main factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. This is called our RTOM (regulated take-off mass), and is the most limiting of our climb limited take-off mass (CLTOM), obstacle limited take-off mass (OLTOM), field length limiting take-off mass (FLLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance, so if we have a long runway surrounded by mountains, then we will likely be limited by the obstacle limited take-off mass, as its value will be lower than all the others. The questions asks which is the likely limiting mass for this runway, giving us the RTOM for all 3 of the aircraft's allowable takeoff flap settings. We can see that the flap settings using MORE flaps increases the RTOM, so the limiting weight must be one that increases with extra flaps. The only part of the takeoff where extra flaps improve performance is the takeoff roll, which is made shorter by greater flap settings, as we can rotate and lift off at a slower speed. Therefore, the limiting weight is the FLLTOM, and it does increase with greater flap settings. This also stands to reason, as the runway is relatively short (for a MRJT aircraft) with a departure over the sea, where obstacle clearance is not a problem. To go through each option: \"Field-Length Limited Take-Off Mass (FLLTOM), which is a factor with short runways and will increase with more slats/flaps.\" This is correct, as mentioned above. \"Accelerate-Stop Distance Mass (ASDM), which is a factor with long runways and will increase with more slats/flaps.\" The ASDM is not a recognised term, and if we take it literally, it would be a factor on short runways, not long ones. \"Climb Limit Mass from the 2nd segment, which is a factor with close-in obstacles and will increase with more slats/flaps.\" The CLTOM (Climb Limited Takeoff Mass) has nothing to do with the obstacles, and would not increase with extra flaps, it would decrease. \"Climb-Limited Take-Off Mass (CLTOM), which is a factor independent of obstacles and will increase with more slats/flaps.\" The CLTOM would decrease with more slats/flaps, due to flaps worsening the climb gradient.",

The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. Thus, according to the ECTM graph, during descent with a constant Mach speed, the IAS/CAS increases. As for the rate of descent, it is known that IAS is increasing. The Sine of Descent angle is given by the formula: Sin Descent angle = (D - T) / W. Since we move away from the VMD, the excess of drag over thrust will increase and the glide angle will become steeper (increased glide angle). The Rate of Climb is given by the formula: ROC = Sin glide angle x TAS. Thus, with a steeper angle, the Rate of Climb will increase. NOTE: Crossover altitude is the altitude where the climb changes from a fixed IAS to a fixed Mach number or the descent changes from a fixed Mach number to a fixed IAS.",

The speed at touchdown that concerns us is the true Groundspeed and is affected in turn by the air density. Overspeed landings can invalidate the field length calculation and easily lead to an overrun. For this question, so as to land within the short runway, the increased mass, because of the extra carried fuel, will increase the landing distance required (LDR). If the air density is low, because of the the high pressure altitude or the high temperature, then the TAS will be higher for a given IAS. Thus, the true Groundspeed will be also higher. The combination of an increased landing mass and high OAT, which leads to a higher Groundspeed, may increase the LDR beyond the LDA, especially on a short runway. In these temperature conditions, the landing mass must be decreased until the LDR is equal or the LDA.",

CAS/IAS - Indicated airspeed is the dynamic pressure measured in a pitot tube, and Calibrated Airspeed is that, just corrected for instrument and position errors. They are usually within a couple of knots of each other, so often considered the same. TAS - True Airspeed is the actual speed of air particles passing the airframe. It is the CAS corrected for density. Mach Number - This is the TAS as a percentage of the local speed of sound. There is a very simple graph that can be drawn to measure the changes in these airspeeds with altitude. It is the ECTM graph (EAS, CAS, TAS, Mach), and the common advice is to \"Eat Chicken Tikka Masala\", which reminds us of the order to use. The airspeed which is being maintained can be made as a vertical line, then all the other lines around it spread outwards from the bottom to the top. See the annex above. CAS/IAS is remaining constant, so is the vertical line. When climbing, go up each line, and go down each line to descend, the direction they go laterally tells us whether that measure increases or decreases in value. Therefore, when descending as shown on the diagram, the Mach number line goes to the left, and therefore the Mach Number decreases. When climbing, the opposite occurs, and the Mach Number would be increasing. The graph is different for each airspeed that is maintained, and there are modifications to TAS vs Mach for inversions and isothermal layers. From that point the rest of this question is incredibly simple, descending at a constant CAS/IAS, the EAS increases, the TAS and the Mach number decrease.",

            "explanation": "Note: There is a very similar question to this that is seen less commonly, and with feedback that is not quite as complete, question 328148. Hydroplaning is caused by a thin layer of fluid that separates the tires from the runway. It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor/no braking action. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms a very thin, impenetrable layer of slippery liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement. Particularly important in this question is the mention of the rubber deposits in the touchdown zone and the runway being wet (indicating viscous hydroplaning). As an extra help, the examiner says that the runway is long so heavy braking is not required, and is also wet, removing the possibility of reverted rubber hydroplaning. The crosswind is the only real problem here, as the lack of traction in the touchdown zone is not a massive issue for braking, but directional control may be difficult if the gear cannot gain traction in crosswind conditions.",

However, if the aircraft keeps descending at a constant Mach, the TAS and IAS will keep increasing, leading to a VMO overspeed situation. Therefore, at the changeover altitude, the flight crew must stop flying at a Mach number and fly at constant IAS. Thus, the aircraft would initially descend at MMO, at the crossover altitude the limiting speed will become VMO.

            "explanation": "The advantage of flying at the maximum range speed is simply that the airplane will use the least amount of fuel and therefore have the least fuel cost for a given distance. Operationally a faster “long range cruise” is often used. This speed is used because, by getting to destination more quickly, more revenue earning flights can be carried out over a given period. For a given time period, 4% more flights can be carried out with only a per-mile fuel consumption increase of 1%. This means that there are 3 key speeds to remember for a jet aeroplane. The slowest is VMD (minimum drag speed), used for best endurance, such as when in the hold. Faster than this is the maximum range speed (often quoted at 1.32 x VMD, though this is an approximation), and changes with wind. Even faster than this is the LRC speed, where the fuel consumption per mile is 1% higher than maximum range, so not as efficient, but the aircraft flies around 4% faster, so can perform more flights in the day. Whilst the crew are cruising at LRC, a reduction in speed will initially decrease fuel flow, as the aircraft is flying with lower drag. Initially, the maximum range of the aircraft will increase slightly, and after a certain speed reduction, it will start to decrease. Therefore, the usefulness of reducing speed is only small (the crew may be able to squeeze around 1% extra range out of the aircraft by flying for max range), and any further reduction in speed will still reduce fuel flow for a while, until VMD is reached, when the aircraft is at its maximum endurance speed. In terms of speed stability, we usually like to operate a speed stable aircraft, where any increase in speed increases total drag, which slows the aircraft back down to the equilibrium speed (where drag = thrust). This occurs when faster than VMD. When flying slower than VMD (often called being on the back side of the drag curve), the aircraft is speed unstable, and any reduction in speed causes an increase in drag, causing a further reduction in speed. It is rare for the examiner to ask about \"how speed stable\" the aircraft is, they usually just ask if it is speed stable/unstable/neutral, however, it is not too difficult to understand. The steeper the gradient of the drag curve at that speed, the stronger the effect of the stability/instability. Therefore, as the aircraft slows down from LRC speed, it gets closer to VMD and the aircraft becomes a little less speed stable. Whilst the speed is higher than VMD the speed is still considered stable, but as the graph is flatter here, it is a lesser effect.",

That's because with hot temperatures, density altitude increases and your airplane \"feels\" like it's flying at a higher altitude. Less air mass flowing over your wings prevents you from generate as much lift, and less oxygen mass in your cylinders prevents you from burning as much fuel, meaning less power. Decreasing air density decreases performance, so be careful on hot days at high altitudes. The higher the air temperature, the less thrust can be produced by the engine. Because of that the difference between the thrust and the drag during takeoff is smaller. Therefore the rate of acceleration is smaller and the aircraft will need a longer takeoff distance. The PLTOM is the lowest of the: FLTOM Climb Limited Mass Tyre Limited Mass Obstacle Limited Mass Practically, the tyre limited mass is rarely limiting because hot, high conditions also reduce the climb limited mass. However, taking off with a tailwind in hot, high conditions could result in a tyre limiting mass and must be checked. This situation could also result in an obstacle limiting mass. If there are no significant obstacles to be cleared after take-off, either the FLTOM or climb limited mass normally limits the PLTOM. To ensure that the aeroplane completes its take-off within the field length available, and then climbs at least the minimum required gradient, the PLTOM must be the lighter of these two masses. However, the pilot has a choice of flap settings. Increasing flap setting increases the FLTOM but reduces the climb limited mass.",

The lower the SFC, the better. The maximum (optimum) endurance will be increased, if flying at a speed where the minimum drag is produced, at VMD, where the SFC is at its lowest.",

Gross performance therefore defines a level of performance that any aircraft of the same type has a 50 percent chance of exceeding at any time. The net performance is the gross performance diminished to allow for various contingencies that cannot be accounted for operationally, e.g., variations in piloting technique, temporarily below-average performance, etc. It is improbable that the net performancel flight path will not be achieved in operation, provided the aircraft is flown in accordance with the recommended techniques, i.e., power, attitude, and speed. Normally, performance graphs show net performance; however, some performance charts, especially for three-engined aircraft, assume gross is equal to net performance. This means that no margin exists between what the graph suggests the aircraft will achieve and what the aircraft will achieve. The net gradient refers to the minimum attainable vertical profile following failure of the critical power unit on take-off (assuming the AFM is adhered to).",

            "explanation": "Take-off with Increased V2 Speed This procedure is used when the performance limited mass is the climb limit mass. At V2 the climbing performance is poor and limits the maximum take-off mass. It is important to understand that in the event of engine failure, the initial climb out speed is V2. However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed. V2 is considerably slower than the best angle of climb speed, which is VX. Climbing with a speed closer to the best angle of climb will greatly enhance the climb performance. If extra runway length is available it would be possible to stay on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed to a higher V1, this will ensure that at the screen height, a faster V2 will be reached, closer to VX. As a result of the improved climb performance, the climb limited mass can be increased. \"The climb gradient is reduced, and we may not clear distant obstacles.\" Incorrect. Increased V2 procedure increases climb gradient, so obstacle clearance should be less of a problem. \"The new V1 may be above controllability limits.\" Incorrect. Controllability limits are talking about VMCG, which is the minimum control speed on the ground, below which the rudder does not have enough airflow to fight an asymmetry if the engine fails. At higher speeds, this would not be a problem. \"The braking efficiency during a rejected take-off will be reduced.\" Incorrect. The braking ability and efficiency will be the same. The increased V1 will mean that we are faster if we do a high speed RTO (Rejected Take-Off), so we will take further to stop, but our braking ability should be unaffected. \"The stop distance may be compromised.\" Correct. Increasing our V1 reduces the safety margin of our ASDA (Accelerate-Stop Distance Available), and must be checked to make sure our ASDR is within our ASDA.",

Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

V2 is the minimum speed that needs to be maintained up to acceleration altitude, in the event of an engine failure after V1. The 1.1 VMC limitation is not affected by weight. However, it is affected by density altitude due to the asymmetric engine thrust – which increases with air density (low altitudes, temperatures and humidity). Based on this, VMC limit is likely a controlling factor at low density altitudes and low aircraft weights (where 1.13 VSR limit is lower).",

Anything that increases the drag, such as the increase of the speed, will reduce the climb angle, because of the reduction in the excess of thrust (T - D).

The requirement is that V1 must be greater than VMCG, so a lower value of VMCG may allow a higher limiting TOM, improving the take off performance. NOTE: Remember that flexible or reduced thrust take-offs are not permitted on contaminated runways and offer no VMC advantage, because it is possible and permitted to increase to TOGA thrust at any point during the take-off, so no reduction in VMCG is possible and a greater distance to V1 will result. This is why flexible thrust is not permitted when anything causes a reduction in aircraft performance (e.g. contamination) or an increase on take-off run required (e.g. increased V2).",

For instance, look at the ASD line (Accelerate-Stop Distance). It shows that, with a low speed V1, the ASD is short, and when the V1 increases, so does the accelerate-stop distance. This stands to reason, as the faster we get to before we stop, the longer our total distance is going to be. The TODN-1 and TORN-1 lines are the opposite, as they correspond to how long the take-off distance and take-off run will be in an engine failure scenario. With a lower V1, they are both long distances, as the aircraft will have to accelerate most of the way up to rotate speed on only 1 engine. As the V1 increases, they both decrease in distance. The TODN and TORN lines are fixed at a certain distance, and do not vary due to V1, as those scenarios do not change at V1 at all. The balanced V1 exists when the ASD is equal to the TODN-1, meaning that for a balanced field runway, there is one perfect V1, which allows the absolute maximum possible mass, and there are no wasted safety margins. The aircraft will use the same distance to stop as it would do to reach screen height from that exact V1 speed.",

The principle is to impose a lower engine rating to benefit from lower minimum control speeds.

We believe that option B (absorbing brake energy) is far more correct, and a much more important factor, whilst option C is still a possible scenario, but very unlikely and much less dangerous than a runway excursion during a rejected take off. Nonetheless, if these two options are present in your exam, you should appeal this question on those grounds. We hope that a previous appeal will remove it from the Portuguese exams at least, but we can never be sure. The Quick Turnaround weight limit is related to the heat of the aeroplane wheel brakes, which absorb the vast majority of the aeroplane's kinetic energy (as heat) during landing. These brakes are then hot (and the temperature of them depends on the weight, approach speed, wind, use of reverse thrust, autobrake setting, etc.). Hot brakes introduce 2 major problems: 1) If the aircraft attempts to take off soon after this, but has to reject the take off at or near V1, the brakes may still be hot, and not able to absorb enough energy to stop the aircraft. This occurs as \"brake fade\", where the extremely hot brakes stop gaining much grip between the brakes and the pads (other, more minor, issues can also occur). 2) To prevent the intense heat from the brakes over pressuring the tyres, the tyres contain \"fusible plugs\" that melt at a certain temperature, allowing a controlled escape of the gas, rather than an explosion. Having hot brakes could cause these to melt, but this usually happens just after extreme braking, such as a RTO (Rejected Take Off) at a heavy weight, and they do not usually melt just after landing, and very rarely during taxi and take off (unless the turnaround time has been very short indeed, and taxiing requires lots of braking) These reasons mean that we would like to get our brakes down to a suitable temperature prior to the next flight, and why pilots may sometimes have to consult the \"minimum turnaround time\" table/figure to find out when this will be. Other methods to help cool the brakes quicker are to place brake fans pointing at them to provide fresh air for improved cooling. Giving the above explanation, we strongly believe the brake fade (absorbing the energy of an RTO) to be the most correct answer here, but see the note above and check the comments for the current feedback on what is considered correct in the exam, as this appears to be disputed by some authorities.",

            "explanation": "Whilst this is more of a question that belongs in AGK, we have evidence to say that it is also a question in the Performance exam. The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. The wear of carbon brakes is based mainly on the number of times they are applied, meaning that a short application wears them down a similar amount to one long application. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible. If either of these brakes overheat though, they will lose effectiveness, and should be cooled as soon as possible, particularly as they may overheat their tyres and cause the fusible plugs to melt. The parking brake should NOT be set in this scenario, as that does not allow any airflow to the brakes, which would prevent effective cooling.",

The main benefits are: Reduced stress and wear on the engine; Reduced cost on parts and mainenance; Increased engine life; Increased reliability, thus improving operating safety and efficency. There are slipt view regarding statements 1 and 4. Some sources state that reduced thrust secondary advantages include fuel savings, however assuming an uninterrupted climb, it will take longer to reach cruising altitude and consequently more fuel will be consumed. Concerning 4., as a result of the lower flight path, reduced take-off thrust may increase the airplane-to-ground noise level but less thrust will also produces less noise. Note: We have received consistent feedback confirming the current correct option (1 and 4). Nevertheless, the correct answer depends on the examiner's views and should therefore be appealed.

It also means that more miles can be flown between inspections when considering maintenance costs. These costs are minimum at the maximum operating speed VMO/MMO. At high speed, the fuel burn increases and total fuel cost for the trip increases. Fuel costs on the other hand will be minimum at the maximum range cruise speed (MRC) and maximum at the maximum operating speed.

            "explanation": "BALANCED FIELD LENGTH When the Accelerate-stop Distance Available (ASDA) is equal to the Take-off Distance Available (TODA), this is known as a Balanced Field Length. Likewise, when the ASDA and TODA are different lengths, this is known as an Unbalanced Field Length. BALANCED FIELD TAKE-OFF A balanced field take-off is performance based and is a condition where the Accelerate-stop Distance Required (ASDR) is equal to the Take-off Distance Required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field take-off can be performed. A Balanced field length is used to simplify the field-length take-off mass. When applying this concept, TOD = ASD and V1 = V1 Balanced. And this means that we are using the minimum requirements in case of engine failure, thus increasing safety margins. When using stopway or clearway, extra distance will be available and V1 will vary. BALANCED V1 The first graph on the attached figure, helps understanding the impact of increasing or decreasing V1. Analyzing it, we can conclude the following: A Balanced V1 is a V1 speed which results in TODR equal to ASDR. Often called the “Ideal V1” as it gives the minimum field length required for a given weight and optimum performance. Any lower V1 (V1 < V1B) would increase TODR, as it would take longer for the aircraft to accelerate to V2 with OEI. As a result, the total field required increases. Any higher V1 (V1 > V1B) would increase ASDR due to a higher energy absorption by the brakes. As a result, the total field required would also increase. => In essence, Balanced V1 improves field length limited take-off performance. => Unbalanced V1 allows for higher take-off weights by taking advantage of any runway and clearway or stopway available in excess of balanced field length. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

At high altitude, the buffet margins on either side are the lowest, in a place called \"coffin corner\", where only a few knots seperate an aircraft's high speed and low speed buffet boundaries. The aircraft must fly within this speed range, and the aircraft may come close to stall (low speed stall or shock stall) if it goes outside the range. An aircraft descending at a constant mach number will stay a fixed margin away from its high-speed buffet boundary, which is a fixed Mach number. The low speed buffet boundary, however, will decrease at high altitude, as the compressibility effects reduce with decreasing altitude. This means that our margin to the buffet boundary (our low speed buffet margin) increases in the descent. The ECTM graph above also shows that our IAS/CAS increases in a descent with constant Mach number, so that brings an even greater increase in our low speed buffet margin (however this is not mentioned in the correct answer).",

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",
