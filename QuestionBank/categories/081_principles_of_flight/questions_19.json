The forces and moments acting on an aircraft following failure of the left engine are The aircraft has a yawing moment towards the dead engine. The pilot has applied rudder to stop the yaw. The vital action when an engine fails is to stop the yaw. It is more aerodynamically efficient to balance the rudder side force by banking towards the live engine, so that lift gives a sideways component opposite to the rudder force. The angle of bank must not exceed 5°, to prevent excessive loss of vertical lift component. Banking towards the live engine also reduces the side force on the fin from sideslip, which minimizes VMC, effectively reduces the yawing moment and gives more rudder authority to stop the yaw. This method produces minimum drag and gives the best ability to climb and is therefore the preferred method of putting the aircraft in equilibrium following engine failure.",

Decreases lift - By disturbing the shape of the wings, ice can cause a large reduction in lift. Increase Weight - Ice build-up can be quite significant, and water is a naturally heavy substance, so lots of weight can be added by the presence of ice. During de-icing on the ground, the fuselage does not always need to be de-iced. Frost or thin layers of ice are usually acceptable to leave on the fuselage, as long as it is not deemed a critical area, such as the wings, control surfaces, engine inlets, propellers, etc. (aircraft with rear mounted engines often have to de-ice the whole fuselage to stop ice shedding off into the engines). This build-up could allow extra weight to be carried in the form of ice or frost during the take-off roll. Whilst it is hoped that only a small amount of ice/frost would be carried, on a large fuselage, that could amount to quite a large weight that is unaccounted for and unknown in value. This could be felt by the pilot as a lack of thrust due to the lower acceleration, and they might have to apply more thrust to account for this. To address the other options: \"A higher angle of attack due to the higher speed in icing conditions.\" Higher speed would cause a lower angle of attack, so this is not correct. \"Ice build-up remaining on the fuselage means you are heavier than expected.\" As discussed above, whilst this should be kept to a minimum, it is possible for this to be the case. \"Increased fuel density due to low temperatures.\" Yes, low temperatures will cause higher fuel density, but large aircraft are fuelled up by mass, and not by volume, so this will just mean that the fuel uses up less of the tank volume than it would in warmer conditions. \"Reduced air density due to low temperatures.\" Low temperatures cause high air density, which would feel like more power than usual.",

Temperature (and the resulting density) is usually not a factor (when the temperature is within the operational limits) in determining the approach speed. With the same approach speed (in IAS) the effectiveness of control will be the same before and upon the initiation of go around. The difference is that in a low temperature (higher density) environment a normally aspirated piston engine will produce a higher power output (with a higher manifold pressure) when compared with a high temperature (lower density) situation during go around in full throttle. Therefore, with more power output at the engines during go around it becomes harder to counteract in an engine failure situation – which leads to an increased demand in the effectiveness of control during engine failure. That demand in higher control effectiveness will be achieved by flying faster – hence an increase in VMCA.",

A raised spoiler will disturb the airflow over the wing, thus reducing lift and increasing drag. The formula for descent gradient is as follows: Sin(γ) = (D – T) ÷ W γ = descent angle (gamma) An increase in drag will increase the descent gradient or angle, which in a descent is observed by an increase in the pitch-down attitude, i.e., a decrease in pitch. The rate of descent can be expressed by the following formula: ROD (ft/m) = TAS x Descent Gradient From the expression above, we can conclude that an increase in the descent gradient increases the rate of descent. Thus, deploying spoilers will allow for an increase in the rate of descent and a decrease in pitch.",

In this question we want to stay in level flight at the same altitude and thrust will not be changed. We will go from a situation where the plane is going straight forward, to a situation where the plane is banked. To understand this, we will have to understand the way lift works on the aircraft. The lift vector goes directly vertical from the aircraft’s fuselage. This means that if the aircraft flies straight, the lift vector points directly upwards. If the aircraft banks to the right, the lift vector will move diagonally towards the right as well, creating a smaller upwards vector together with a vector towards the right, which creates the yaw moment resulting in the right turn. If we look at the lift formula (CL * ½ * ρ * V^2 * S), we see that the lift coëfficiënt and speed are directly related. In case of the banked aircraft, the upwards vector (vertical lift) decreased. To remain at the same altitude, we must pitch up (increase in CL). With a constant thrust position, speed will therefore decrease.",

As a result, it is important to try to minimize fuel consumption versus time as much as possible, or to simply minimize fuel flow (kg or lb per hour). SPEED FOR MINIMUM RATE OF DESCENT Rate of descent depends on both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path. Rate of descent is not minimum at VMD, where the angle of descent is minimum, because the speed is moderately fast. Rate of descent is actually minimum at VMP (the velocity for minimum power). This means that maximum endurance (maximum time in the air) is achieved at VMP. The attached figure shows two aeroplanes descending, one at VMD and the other at VMP. Although the aeroplane descending at VMP has a slightly steeper angle of descent, the much slower speed (76% of the speed at VMD) results in a lower (minimum) rate of descent.",

This has numerous benefits, including the shortening of runways. Flaps have very limited uses in flight, though, and there is a good reason why pilots are so hasty to get rid of them after take-off. Flaps increase the drag of a wing, reducing climb rates and increasing fuel burn. The use of flaps in a glide descent increases the drag for no real increase in lift (flaps can increase lift, but the aircraft has not got any heavier, so does not need it), and therefore drastically reduce the L/D ratio (Lift to Drag ratio). The L/D ratio is what decides the glide angle, and flaps cause a steeper glide angle, leading to a greater rate of descent. The pilot therefore made a very poor decision, and has drastically decreased their available glide distance and glide endurance. Usually, if gliding to a forced landing, the pilot will remain in a clean configuration as long as possible, until landing is assured, then can extend flaps as required to slow down sufficiently and make a slower landing.",

These two things are different and shall therefore be eliminated differently. A slipping turn is a turn where the aircraft’s nose is outside of the turning radius and the tail is in the turn radius. A slip is caused by using too much bank and too little rudder. A skidding turn is a turn where the aircraft’s nose is inside of the turning radius and the tail is outside of the turn radius. A skid is caused by using too much rudder and not enough bank. The indicator works via the “step on the ball” principle.

One component (W cos γ) acts perpendicular to the flight path and is balanced by Lift, while the other component (W sin γ) acts forward along the flight path and ‘adds’ to the Thrust to balance Drag. If the nose of the aircraft is lowered with a constant Thrust setting, the increased component of Weight acting forward along the flight path will cause an increase in IAS. The increased IAS will result in an increase in Drag which will eventually balance the increased forward force of Weight and equilibrium will be re-established. If the throttle is closed, the force of Thrust is removed, and a larger forward component of Weight must be provided to balance Drag and maintain a constant IAS. This is accomplished by lowering the nose of the airplane to increase the descent angle (γ). In a descent Lift is less than Weight. This is because Lift only has to balance the component of Weight perpendicular to the flight path (W cos γ). L = W cosγ In a descent Thrust is less than Drag. This is because Weight is giving a forward component in the same direction as Thrust (W sin γ). D = T + W sinγ",

For maximum efficiency, the wings should produce maximum lift with the least possible drag. The L/D ratio increases with angle of attack up to a maximum at about 4°; this is called the “optimum” angle of attack. The L/D ratio then decreases with increasing angle of attack until CLMAX is reached. ANGLE OF DESCENT IN THE GLIDE Glide angle is a function ONLY of the L/D ratio. The descent (glide) angle will be least when the L/D ratio is the greatest. L/D ratio is a maximum at the optimum angle of attack, and this also corresponds to the minimum drag speed (VMD). At speeds above or below VMD the glide angle will be steeper. Maximum distance in a glide can be achieved when the aircraft is flown at (L/D)MAX (VMD). EFFECT OF WIND The glide angle will determine the distance that the aircraft can glide for a given change of height. GLIDE DISTANCE = HEIGHT LOSS × (LIFT / DRAG) This distance would only be achieved in still air. If there is a wind, the ground speed will change, and so the distance over the ground will change. In a headwind the ground distance will be decreased, and in a tailwind it will be increased. In this question, using the above formula, where: Height Loss = 1000m Lift/Drag = 25 GLIDE DISTANCE = HEIGHT LOSS × (LIFT / DRAG) = 1000 x 25 = 25000m GLIDE DISTANCE = 25000m.",

            "explanation": "This question is about force/moment couples. In a conventional aeroplane, the Lift opposes the Weight and the Thrust opposes the Drag, however, the Lift is produced from the Centre of Pressure (CP), and the Weight is produced from the Centre of Gravity (CG). The CG is ahead of the CP, so that \"force couple\" produces a nose down moment on the aircraft. Thrust and Drag have a similar relationship. Thrust is produced through the thrust line of the engines, and Drag is produced from the Centre of Pressure, and therefore if the engines are mounted low down (underslung), this \"force couple\" will provide a nose up moment, but if they are mounted high up, above the wings, then this \"force couple\" may produce a nose down moment instead. The tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) is present, not only to provide a place to mount the elevator control surfaces, but also as a way to balance out the force couples through the aircraft with a pitch trim system. Tailplanes usually provide downforce on a conventional aeroplane in order to provide a tail-down, nose-up balancing moment, and that is what the examiner is talking about here, so even though sometimes tailplanes can provide upwards lift, it is much rarer. The downforce produced by tailplanes is undesirable as it assists gravity in pulling the aircraft downwards, meaning that the main wing has to produce more lift to counteract this, increasing the stall speed and, more importantly, increasing drag. A few ways to reduce this downforce are to change the force couples mentioned above. The CG can be moved aft to reduce the Lift/Weight couple, so the aircraft doesn't need as much nose-up moment, and therefore the tail can produce less downforce. Another factor is the engine placement, and the lower the engines are mounted, the greater the nose-up moment from the Thrust/Drag couple becomes, and the LESS downforce that is required from the tailplane. We are aware that, if the tailplane is providing an upwards force already with high mounted engines, that this upwards force will increase for low mounted engines, however this would not be a conventional aeroplane at that point, so is not what the examiner is talking about, which removes the potential of two correct answers.",

The typical action is to apply rudder in the direction of the live engine to counteract this forward slip. However, while the nose will be aligned with the desired flight path doing this, the actual flight path is a side slip towards the dead engine side, which creates excess drag. The only available counter to this is to bank the airplane into the direction of the live engine to counteract the rudder force using the horizontal component of lift. The angle of bank must not exceed 5°, to prevent excessive loss of vertical lift component.",

Alternatively, feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. We are also under the impression that this has been seen in Principles of Flight, but believe it to be more of a Performance question, so let us know which exam you see this in, thanks. In the event of a fuel leak, our main problem as a flight crew is the chance of fuel exhaustion before a safe landing has been made. It is for that reason that we must make our way to the nearest suitable airfield as fast as possible, but by using the least amount of fuel; after all, we do not want to run out of fuel faster than we have to, by using it or by leaking it. It is for this reason that we have to fly at the best range speed, the same as we would when we want to reach a destination whilst using as little fuel as possible. However, this is a different \"best range\" speed. When we are leaking out fuel, our total fuel \"consumption\" changes, and goes from the standard fuel consumption/speed curve (which closely follows the drag curve), to the same curve, just lifted up, as the fuel consumption has been increased across the board by whatever rate the fuel is leaking at. Of course, the leak could be variable with speed or pressure, etc. but this is the general idea of it, and we should not have to delve as far as those factors. The best range of an aircraft is the point at which the fuel consumption is lowest for the highest speed, and this is shown on the graph by the point where a line from the origin first touches the curve. As you can see in the annex above, the best range speed is higher for the curve with the fuel leak. This is because the fuel is also leaking from the tank, and the faster we go, the less we allow to leak from the tank overall, so the more we have available to burn. This finds an equilibrium with how much drag we are willing to accept by flying faster, and therefore burning fuel at a higher rate. The faster the fuel leak, the higher this optimal speed becomes, starting at the normal \"Best Range\" speed for a very small/no leak, and increasing to VMO for incredibly fast fuel leaks. Further note: We would prefer an answer that mentions something to do with the increased best range speed, or perhaps a speed between best range speed and VMO.",

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cosγ T = D + W sinγ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T/W)−(D/L) In this exercise, Weight is equal to 500000N, D/L ratio is equal to 1/12 and Thrust equal to 21000N per engine. For the all engines (four) climb gradient and applying the formula defined above: sin γ = (84000/500000)−(1/12) sin γ = 0.085 ⇒ sinγ = 8.5% The climb gradient is 8.5%.",

If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, the centripetal force is defined as: CF = L * sinΦ And Weight is defined by: W = L * cosΦ Dividing one by the other, we get: (L∗ sinΦ)/(L∗ cosΦ) = CF/W Then: tanΦ = CF/W W * tanΦ = CF For a 45° bank angle where tan 45° = 1, CF = W.",

If it is not present, the aircraft will be unable to maintain a curved path, but instead will fly off at a tangent. When the aircraft banks, the total lift force tilts; the horizontal component of lift provides the centripetal force and the vertical component of lift supports the weight of the aircraft. There are a few ways to calculate the centripetal force. You can use the formula -- Centripetal force = Lift x sin(bank angle) -- but this would require some extra steps in this question, as the lift is not equal to weight, during the banked turn. You can certainly work out the lift from the formula -- Lift = Weight / cos(bank angle) -- if you like, and this will work fine, followed by the formula above to work out the centripetal force. Instead, using basic trigonometry, we can work out that the weight and the centripetal force are linked by the tan function, and the following formula exists (There is a formula derivation in the explanation of question 819095 if you are interested but you do not need to know it for the exams, just remember the formula). Centripetal force = Weight x tan(bank angle) Before we can make the calculation, we must first calculate the weight from the mass, using the formula -- Weight = Mass x acceleration due to gravity (g) The acceleration due to gravity is a value of 9.81 m/s2 on the Earth's surface (sometimes questions will ask you to use 10 m/s2 for this). Weight = 60 000 x 9.81 = 588 600 N Using the above formula, Centripetal force = 588 600 x tan(60) = 1 019 485 N",

The descent (glide) angle will be minimum when the L/D ratio is maximum at the optimum angle of attack. Maximum distance in a glide can be achieved when the aircraft is flown at L/DMAX (VMD). The maximum L/D ratio of an aircraft will be obtained in the clean configuration. Extension of flaps, spoilers, speed brakes or landing gear etc. will reduce L/DMAX and give a steeper glide angle thus reducing glide range. A lower L/D Ratio due to an increase of drag, will increase the ROD and reduce the glide duration at any speed.",

As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: The down-going blade (viewed from the cockpit) will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-swinging blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line. Propellers rotating in the same direction (clockwise): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa. The left engine is therefore the critical engine. Counter-rotating propellers: they are called counter-rotating propellers because the propeller on one wing turn in the opposite direction to the one on the other wing. The principle advantage of counter-rotation is to balance propeller torque effects thus eliminating any problems associated with a Critical engine. => For both counter-rotating inwards or outwards, the yawing moment will be the same regardless if the right or left engine fails.",

One component (W cos γ) acts perpendicular to the flight path and is balanced by Lift, while the other component (W sin γ) acts forward along the flight path and ‘adds’ to the Thrust to balance Drag.

Normally, procedures will be designed to provide protected airspace and obstacle clearance for aircraft up to and including Category D. However, where airspace requirements are critical, procedures may be restricted to lower speed categories. 1.3.9 Alternatively, the procedure may specify a maximum IAS for a particular segment without reference to aircraft category. In any case, it is essential that pilots comply with the procedures and information depicted on instrument flight charts and the appropriate flight parameters (.) if the aircraft is to remain in the areas developed for obstacle clearance purposes. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given bank angle is directly proportional to the square of the airspeed. Which means that doubling the airspeed results in a radius of turn that is four times greater RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn. Note: departures generally have charted speeds to ensure that the aircraft remains inside the obstacle clearance area. In that case, following published speeds will guarantee obstacle clearance.",

            "explanation": "If the rudder is moved to yaw the aeroplane about its normal axis the outside wing of the aeroplane travels slightly faster than the inner wing and therefore develops more lift. As a consequence, the outer wing will rise and the inner wing will fall. WING DIHEDRAL AND RUDDER INPUT IN A TURN Wing dihedral is very powerful in producing lateral stability. Dihedral effect is used to discribe the lateral stability contribution of other airplane components, such as rudder and sweptback wings. Rudder input produces sideslip and contributes to the dihedral effect. The effect is proportional to the angle of sideslip - roll increases with sideslip angle and, therefore, roll increases with increasing rudder input. The rudders on transport airplanes are sized to counter the yawing moment associated with an engine failure at very low takeoff speeds and to conduct crosswind takeoffs and landings, using up to maximum pedal input. Any excessive rudder input can produce a large sideslip angle, which will generate a rolling moment that requires significant lateral control input to stop the airplane from rolling. The rudder should not normally be used to induce roll through sideslip because it has the potential to induce rapid roll rates with significant time delays from the initial input. This overreaction can induce abrupt yawing moments and violent out-of-phase roll rates, which can lead to successive cyclic rudder deflections, known as rudder reversals as the pilot tries to control the resulting motions. Large aggressive control reversals induce loads that can exceed structural design limits. Except in crosswind takeoff and landing, keeping the sideslip as close to zero as possible will ensure that the maximum amount of lateral control is available for maneuvering. Rudder should only be used in combination with ailerons/spoilers to eliminate sideslip, not create it.",

Roll effects are counteracted by the ailerons. The counteracting forces generated by the aerodynamic control surfaces are proportional to the square of the airspeed (V2), to the area of the control surfaces (S) and to the air density. For a given size of the vertical tail with rudder, there is a speed below which the generated rudder side force is not large enough to counteract the asymmetrical thrust, or below which the ailerons are not effective anymore: the heading and/or bank angle cannot be maintained below this speed. This speed is called Minimum Control speed VMC. With regards to this question, Cold air is more dense. Engines are able to produce more power in colder weather due to being able to achieve higher mass flow with the higher density air. As power increases, the operative engine requires more rudder authority to maintain directional stability due to the increase in thrust. As a result, the airplane requires higher indicated airspeeds to maintain directional stability. Therefore, VMCA increases. Low altitudes have the same effect on VMC as cold air.",

Here's a crucial mistake to avoid: Adding right rudder to tighten the turn without coordinating the bank and rudder, leading to a skid. This can result in a disastrous chain of events. The skid induces an over-banking tendency, prompting a subconscious response of adding opposite aileron, pulling the nose down. Suddenly, the aircraft stalls. If the airplane is skidding toward the outside of the turn, it will have a tendency to roll to the inside of the turn because the inside wing stalls first. Why does the inside wing drop first in a skid? Aerodynamic factors come into play, but the fundamental principles are straightforward. In a skid, the aircraft turns too fast for the bank angle, yawing into the turn, often caused by excessive rudder input. This accelerates the outside wing, increasing its lift and causing the aircraft to roll into the turn. To counter this, opposite aileron is added, increasing the angle of attack on the inside, low wing. As the inside wing surpasses the critical angle of attack, it stalls and drops.",

If a force does not act directly through the aircraft's centre of gravity, then it also creates a moment (turning force). To be in equilibrium (heading and speed not changing), the aircraft's forces and moments must all match up and be equal. As the question has mentioned sideslipping, then we can assume that we are in the wings level scenario, and are sideslipping towards the dead engine. See the annex above, the top half shows us what we need to see for this question, the wings level scenario. Assuming the right engine fails, the left engine is producing a clockwise moment (viewed from above). The rudder has to be deflected to the left to produce a right-wards side force on the aircraft tail, this anticlockwise moment evens out the thrust asymmetry moment, except now we are not longer flying straight, we are sideslipping to the right. The combination of forwards thrust and rightwards force mean we have the relative airflow hitting us from the right-hand side. This causes another force. The extra force can have different names, but EASA are calling it the fuselage side force. It imagines the fuselage is a wing, and the air coming from the side is creating an angle of attack, creating a sidewards lifting effect, off to the left side, opposite to the rudder force direction. This is fine, but we have to consider what moment it might produce. If it were just the fuselage to consider, then the lifting force would happen in front of the CG, but due to other features (mainly the large tail fin), the total force acts from behind the CG. In this way, it is an opposing moment to the rudder (it is acting with the thrust asymmetry), and means the required rudder force is higher. The diagram calls it the \"weathercocking yawing moment\". Looking at the bottom half of the annex, you can see that the small bank angle to the live engine makes the sideslip go away and can reduce the complexity of the scenario greatly, and reduce drag.",

The aircraft does not know what the wind component is, it will glide exactly the same, wind or no wind. The only difference will be where it ends up. Therefore the rate of descent in the glide will be exactly the same, and the time to descend will be exactly the same. So if that is the case, then it is only the Groundspeed which influences how far the aircraft can glide, and it is a directly proportional relationship. The \"long\" way of calculating this is to calculate the time to descend by dividing the distance by the groundspeed/60 for the still air case. Still air means groundspeed = TAS = 100 kt. Time (minutes) = 9.8 / (100/60) = 5.88 minutes. Then multiply that time by the new groundspeed, 100 kt TAS - 15 kt Headwind Component = 85 kt Groundspeed. Distance (NM) = 5.88 x (85/60) = 8.33 NM, closest answer 8.4 NM Or, even more simply, now you know that there is a directly proportional relationship, next time just do distance x (new GS/old GS): 9.8 x (85/100) = 8.33 NM",

This can very quickly result in a strong rolling moment also, and can cause a full loss of directional control. The pilot must counteract this initial yawing moment with opposite rudder input (rudder input towards the live engine). This rudder input creates a sideslip condition, which is controllable, but given the fact the engine has just lost half of its available thrust, is slightly undesirable due to the higher drag it causes. This is why a small bank towards the live engine may be desirable. Often called \"five to the live\", a bank angle of up to 5º towards the operating engine uses the lifting of the wings to keep the aircraft flying in the same direction it is pointing, and therefore reduces the amount of sideslip required, and also slightly reduces the required rudder input. Both of these act to reduce drag, and therefore increase the possible rate of climb, or reduce the fuel flow to the engines, etc. The question asks for the most aerodynamically efficient method of counteracting the yaw moment, which we would consider to be \"the method producing the least drag\", which is certainly by using the rudder and ailerons. The other options are mostly possible to regain control after an engine failure, but are either very high drag, very slow to use, or just incredibly inefficient (in terms of drag) for counteracting yaw.",

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cos γ T = D + W sin γ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T/W)−(D/L) In this exercise, Weight is equal to 500000 N, D/L ratio is equal to 1/10 and Thrust equal to 60000 N per engine. For the all engines (two) climb gradient and applying the formula defined above: sin γ = (120000/500000) − (1/10) sin γ = 0.14 ⇒ sinγ = 14% The climb gradient is 14%.",

In the scenario described, it is not fully clear, but it seems like the pilot has opted to keep the wings level. In this situation, the rudder is used to prevent yaw while the ailerons maintain the level of the wings. The rudder is more effective at higher speeds due to increased airflow, and therefore les effective at lower speeds, but the thrust asymmetry doesn't change much with speed, meaning that there is a lowest possible airspeed where the rudder can fully oppose the thrust asymmetry, called VMC (there are a few versions of this speed, but VMC or VMCA is the normal one for in-flight). In terms of the force on the vertical fin, it is primarily fed by the sideslip angle, with the airflow coming from the side of the failed engine, and the slower the aircraft goes, the steeper the sideslip angle, and the higher the load on the vertical fin. If the sideslip angle (β) becomes excessive, there's a risk of the vertical fin stalling. As mentioned above, the pilot can bank slightly towards the live engine side (up to 5 degrees), which uses the weight of the aircraft to counteract some of the necessary sideslip, reducing the force on the fin and some of the required rudder force also. Therefore, in the opposite direction, banking towards the failed/inoperative engine will further increase the load on the fin. VMCG is the minimum control speed on the ground.",

Yawing towards the live engine generates sideslip, which in turn produces a force on the aircraft's vertical surfaces. This sideslip force opposes the rudder force, necessitating greater rudder displacement. As the asymmetric thrust moment coefficient (Cn) increases with a decrease in EAS (increase in alpha), the yawing moment from the live engine increases with decreasing EAS. Consequently, more rudder is needed to counteract this heightened yawing moment, leading to an increase in sideslip. As sideslip increases, rudder effectiveness diminishes progressively.

A spin may be defined as an aggravated stall resulting in autorotation, which means the rotation is stable and will continue due to aerodynamic forces if nothing intervenes. During the spin, the wings remain unequally stalled. PRIMARY CAUSES OF A SPIN A stall must occur before a spin can take place. A spin occurs when one wing stalls more than the other. The wing that is more stalled will drop and the nose of the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the lower wing. The cause of an accidental spin is exceeding the critical angle of attack while performing a manoeuvre with either too much or not enough rudder input for the amount of aileron being used (crossed-controls). If the correct stall recovery is not initiated promptly, the stall could develop into a spin. Co-ordinated use of the flight controls is important, especially during flight at low airspeed and high angle of attack. SKIDDING TURN A skidding turn is a turn where the aircraft’s nose is inside of the turning radius and the tail is outside of the turnradius. A skid is caused by using too much rudder and not enough bank.",

            "explanation": "A coordinated turn is when no sideslip occurs on the aircraft. An uncoordinated turn can either be a slipping turn or a skidding turn. Those that know cars will be able to think of this similar to understeer (slipping turn) and oversteer (skidding turn). Slipping turns occur when ailerons are used to turn without enough rudder, so for example a left turn without using any left rudder. The aircraft rolls left and starts sideslipping to the left but the body does not actually rotate in that direction as fast as the turn occurs, and the aircraft \"slips\" or \"falls\" into the turn. This looks a bit like understeer in a car. Skidding turns are more like drifting a car (oversteer). Too much rudder has been used in the direction of turn, with not enough ailerons, so the bank angle is not steep enough to fly in a coordinated manner. A skidding turn to the left means that the aircraft would be pointing into the turn too much, sideslipping to the right. A skidding turn can be fixed by reducing the rudder input (or applying opposite rudder) or by rolling further into the turn, as extra bank angle can also coordinate the turn (if no extra rudder is used). Airspeed is a bit more complex in this scenario, and we don't believe that it is within the current learning objectives to ask such a question, but if you look creatively at the LOs and combine them with a bit of extra mental stretching, then we can slightly see what the examiner might be trying to test. They are getting at the fact that at higher airspeeds, to get the same rate of turn, the aircraft needs a greater angle of bank. So therefore, for the turn in the question, if we have too little bank angle, that could also mean that we have the correct bank angle for that rate of turn, but we're just going too fast, and THAT is the reason our turn is a skidding turn. Imagine we use the bank angle to do a coordinated rate 1 turn (3 degrees per second) to the left at 70 kts, but we are doing 110 kts instead. Not enough bank angle would be used to get 3 degrees per second, and that left rudder input to make us turn at 3 degrees per second would make the turn uncoordinated (skidding) at that higher speed. It is difficult to imagine, as it is a completely ridiculous scenario. Of course, in reality we would just fly a coordinated turn at 110 kts, realise that the bank angle isn't giving us 3 degrees per second, and increase it, but the examiner is trying - quite poorly - to combine more than one learning objective here. Therefore, we are saying that a skidding turn can be caused by having INSUFFICIENT bank angle and/or TOO MUCH airspeed.",

If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, the load factor (n) is defined by: n = L/W = 1/cos Φ In a turn, the load factor depends only on the bank angle.

            "explanation": "Glide angle (and glide range) assumes no thrust, and therefore is determined directly by the lift over drag (L/D) ratio. The best L/D ratio occurs at VMD, the speed for minimum drag. Glide angle = CD / CL GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. There are two ways to calculate this question. METHOD 1 With a L/D ratio of 16:1, this means the glide ratio is 16:1 (horizontal distance : vertical distance). Therefore, at a TAS of 90 kt, the vertical speed is 90/16 = 5.625 kt 5.625 kt = 5.625nm per hour. Multiply by 6080 to get feet per hour, then divide by 60 to get feet per minute, giving 570 fpm rate of descent. The aircraft will take a time of 3 000 / 570 = 5.263 minutes to descend 3 000 ft. 5.263 minutes (divide by 60) is 0.0877 hours. Multiply this by the groundspeed this time (90 - 10 = 80 kt) to get the distance travelled over the ground in that time. 0.0877 x 80 = 7.016 nm, closest answer 7.02 nm METHOD 2 3 000 ft to descend at glide ratio of 16:1 means that the horizontal distance travelled is 3 000 x 16 = 48 000 ft. Divide this by 6080 ft/nm to get a still air ground distance of 7.895 nm. With a headwind, this distance is reduced slightly (already the correct answer can likely be guessed). The reduction is the headwind as a proportion of the TAS, so the distance is reduced by 10kt/90kt = 0.111., or in other words, the new distance is 88.9% of the still air distance. 7.89 x 0.889 = 7.018 nm, closest answer 7.02 nm. This second way is faster if you are comfortable with visualising it like this, especially as the correct answer can be identified quite early on with gross error checking, but if in doubt, use METHOD 1.",

            "explanation": "This question is asking about stable asymmetric flight with wings level. This is one of the standard methods for flying with a failed engine, and the other method is to fly with a small bank angle towards the live engine (five to the live). When we fly in stable (heading not changing) asymmetric flight, there is a complex combination of forces on the aircraft. If a force does not act directly through the aircraft's centre of gravity, then it also creates a moment (turning force). To be in equilibrium (heading and speed not changing), the aircraft's forces and moments must all match up and be equal. See the annex above, the top half shows us what we need to see for this question, the wings level scenario. Assuming the right engine fails, the left engine is producing a clockwise moment (viewed from above). The rudder has to be deflected to the left to produce a right-wards side force on the aircraft tail (a force away from the live engine), this anticlockwise moment evens out the thrust asymmetry moment, except now we are not longer flying straight, we are sideslipping to the right. The combination of forwards thrust and rightwards force mean we have the relative airflow hitting us from the right-hand side. This causes another force. The extra force can have different names, but this question calls it the fuselage side force. It imagines the fuselage is a wing, and the air coming from the side is creating an angle of attack, creating a sidewards lifting effect, off to the left side, opposite to the rudder force direction. This is fine, but we have to consider what moment it might produce. If it were just the fuselage to consider, then the lifting force would happen in front of the CG, but due to other features (mainly the large tail fin), the total force acts from behind the CG. In this way, it is an opposing moment to the rudder (it is acting with the thrust asymmetry), and means the required rudder force is higher. The diagram calls it the \"weathercocking yawing moment\". It happens because of sideslip; ballistic skid appears to be a made-up phrase. Looking at the bottom half of the annex, you can see that the small bank angle to the live engine makes the sideslip go away and can reduce the complexity of the scenario greatly, and reduce drag.",

A coordinated turn is one in which the only acceleration is along the normal axis of the airplane, towards the center of the turn, and the angle of bank is precisely correct for the aircraft speed and the radius of turn. If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, the load factor (n) is defined by: n = L/W = 1/ cos Φ On a 45° bank turn, to maintain the same lift as in straight and level flight, L/W = 1/cos 45 L = W * 1/ cos⁡ 45 L= 1.41 * W Lift must be increased 1.41 times, or 41%.",

SPEED FOR MINIMUM RATE OF DESCENT Rate of descent depends on both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path. Rate of descent is not minimum at VMD, where the angle of descent is minimum, because the speed is moderately fast. Rate of descent is actually minimum at VMP (the velocity for minimum power). This means that maximum endurance (maximum time in the air) is achieved at VMP. The attached figure shows two aeroplanes descending, one at VMD and the other at VMP. Although the aeroplane descending at VMP has a slightly steeper angle of descent, the much slower speed (76% of the speed at VMD) results in a lower (minimum) rate of descent.",

We are still receiving different pieces of information about this question and it may appear differently in the exam. Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com so we can verify the wording and answer, thank you! As mentioned above, it is difficult to see what the examiner want from us, with 4 options that are quite close really. Of course, if we have burnt more fuel than expected, we would like to fly for best range. This means flying at 1.32VMD (jet) in the cruise, and at VMD in the descent, which gives best \"glide\" range. we are not gliding in this scenario, we have idle thrust set (we would assume), but the result is quite similar. Flying at VMP (minimum power) is sometimes desirable in a glide descent, as it provides the lowest descent rate, as even though the aircraft has slightly more drag, the speed is much lower, so the aircraft descends at a steeper angle, but more slowly (see annex above). If we wanted to spend a longer time at altitude, then VMP would be the speed to choose, but beware, it would mean that we have to fly further in the cruise before beginning descent. We can therefore see what the examiner is thinking about with their answer of \"VMP; for minimum descent rate\", but we think it is still tenuous at best. We believe this must be something to do with staying at a higher altitude for longer, but without an in-depth analysis of the fuel savings of both, we cannot say with absolute certainty which is correct.",

With both engines operating at the same power setting on a twin-engine aircraft, the amount of thrust produced by each engine is identical and their lines of action are symmetrically displaced about the aircraft's normal axis. If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), (plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG). The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder moment arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force). This question is asking us which scenario is worst for controllability, which is where there is a high yawing moment, and our rudder has a low balancing moment. This would be at low altitude, high thrust settings, and low airspeed. This is because the high thrust creates a large asymmetry, and there is not much airflow over the rudder to fight against it. A further decrease in controllability comes when the aircraft is at a low weight. The pilot can use a small bank angle onto the side of the live engine to reduce the aircraft's sideslip, and therefore its rudder deflection. This \"banking technique\" uses the aircraft's weight, and a heavier aircraft (counter-intuitively) is actually better for controllability. Therefore, the worst scenario here is during a go-around with an empty aircraft.",

We do know that angle of attack decreases as speed increases though in straight and level flight, so we can read off relative changes in speed from the graph. Firstly, we can note a few points from the graph. Position 1 has no CL, therefore no lift is produced and this is an impossible scenario for straight and level flight. It also shows that the CD is lowest at this point, as no induced drag is produced, so the only drag remaining is parasite drag. We would have to fly impossibly fast to fly straight and level at position 1, it shows the high speed boundary of the curve. Position 2 has the highest CL for the lowest CD on this graph, this is the point of best Lift/Drag ratio. A very useful point to know; in terms of speed, it is the minimum drag speed VMD. Position 4 is the next easiest to note, it is the point of highest CL, but quite high CD also. This is the critical angle of attack, and in speed terms, is VS. To the right of this point, the lift reduces and drag continues to increase, and is the stalled region. Position 3 is between the stall speed and VMD, and is assumed to be VMP (minimum power required speed). There is no defining feature of VMP on this type of diagram, such as a tangent or highest/lowest point. From these positions, we can see that the speed of the aircraft increases going from 4 to 1, the speed trend is marked on the figure above. Therefore, going from position 2 to position 4 in straight and level flight means that the aircraft's airspeed is decreasing.",

When on the ground, during take-off and landing predominantly, the aircraft will naturally want to turn into the crosswind, a process called weathercocking, that is brought on by the stabilising effect of the tail fin. Therefore, a crosswind from the right would increase the yaw of applying full power, so would be worse in this scenario. In terms of weight, being light is better for climb performance, but a light aircraft has worse single engine handling characteristics, due to its lower momentum and angular momentum. This means that, rather unusually for principles of flight, higher weight is better for single engine handling (also it helps with banking over the live engine in flight, as the higher weight has more of an effect with less bank required).

Now, the cosine of any angle is always between -1 and 1, so for L to be greater than W, the equation must be L cos φ = W (any bank angle requires a larger lift to balance the same weight). If you get stuck with whether to divide or multiply by cos φ, sometimes you can just try it and see if the answer goes the correct way (i.e. gets larger or gets smaller), which is a very useful gross error check.",

            "explanation": "ENGINE FAILURE If one engine on a conventional twin-engine aircraft fails in flight, it adversely affects its performance and controllability. With both engines operating at the same power setting on a twin-engine aircraft, the amount of thrust produced by each engine is identical and their lines of action are symmetrically displaced about the aircraft's normal axis. If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG. The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force). Rudder to Stop Yaw - Bank Towards Live Engine It is more aerodynamically efficient to balance the rudder sideforce by banking towards the live engine, so that lift gives a sideways component opposite to the rudder force. The angle of bank must not exceed 5°, to prevent excessive loss of vertical lift component. Banking towards the live engine also reduces the side force on the fin from sideslip, which minimizes VMC, effectively reduces the yawing moment and gives more rudder authority to stop the yaw. The cockpit indication will be the turn needle central with the slip indicator (ball) one half diameter displaced towards the live engine. The ‘ball’ is not centred, but the aircraft is not sideslipping. This method produces minimum drag and gives the best ability to climb and is therefore the preferred method of putting the aircraft in equilibrium following engine failure.",

At a positive angle of attack and when viewed from the rear, the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller is displaced to the right of the engine centre line because the down going blade generates more thrust than the up going blade. Therefore, if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. Thus, if the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. Consequently, we can safely say that with clockwise rotating propellers, the critical engine is the left one. The aircraft has the natural tendency to swing its nose into the wind in response to a sideslip (left wind results in left yaw). This will add to the already existent tendency to yaw towards the left due to the left engine failure and will increase the difficulty to control and the need for a larger rudder deflection.

VMCL is very similar to the other two minimum control speeds, in that it mainly is set by the thrust asymmetry vs the rudder force available. The asymmetry caused by running one engine at maximum power/thrust with the other engine failed/windmilling can be huge, and causes a very large yawing moment towards the dead engine. This must be counteracted by the rudder force, to stop the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. At high speeds, this is fine, as the rudder has plenty of airflow over it and therefore can counteract the thrust asymmetry just fine, but at lower speeds, this is not the case. There is a speed, below which the rudder does not have the available force to counteract the thrust asymmetry of a failed engine at maximum thrust. This would be because the rudder does not have a fast enough airflow over it, and has reached its maximum deflection angle. Below this speed, even at maximum rudder deflection, the aircraft will yaw towards the dead engine. This speed is called the minimum control speed. Minimum control speeds change with the density altitude, but not because of the airflow over the rudder (this has a small effect), instead due to the difference in thrust available from the engine. At lower density altitudes (higher air densities), there is more air to be mixed with fuel and burnt, so the thrust is higher, and therefore the thrust asymmetry with a failed engine is higher, and the rudder needs more airflow to counteract this higher moment, so the minimum control speed is higher. Therefore, at an increased density altitude, the thrust is lower, so the VMCL is decreased also.",

Therefore, the speed decreases from a maximum at point A to a minimum at point D. Long Range Cruise (LRC) speed is the speed above the maximum-range cruise (MRC) speed which provides 99 percent of the absolute maximum specific range. The advantage is that 1 percent of range is traded for 3 to 5 percent higher cruise velocity. Point A: is between VMD and the maximum speed and has the minimum drag coefficient. It therefore approximates VY for a jet airplane. Point B: is the point at which a tangent from the origin touches the polar curve, which is at the point at which the total drag is minimum, the lift/drag ratio is maximum and the IAS in level flight is VMD. This is also the speed at which the longest glide distance will be achieved. Point C: falls between VMD and VS and is approximately VMP, which approximates to the speed of VY for a piston/propeller airplane and indicates the value at which the minimum sink rate will occur. It is the speed that will attain the maximum endurance during a descent. Point D: is where CL and CD are both maximum and the point at which the minimum speed in level flight, the stalling speed, VS is attained.",

All you have to do is fly at VMD for your aircraft, which means flying at the correct angle of attack => If the angle of attack is away from the optimum then the aircraft will descend steeper due to the increase in drag. Extending flap or airbrake (configuration) will also have an effect on your gliding angle => For instance, if you take a look at the drag polar (CL against CD diagram, you may notive that flaps reduce the lift/drag ration, which will steepne the glide path. Flaps increase the angle of descent and reduce the range. Note: Glide angle is independent of mass. For example: A heavier aircraft will have a higher VMD and descend faster but with the same glide angle.",

This works similarly in a jet aircraft as in a propeller aircraft. If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. If uncorrected, this could cause significant yaw and roll towards the failed engine side and could cause loss of control. This means that the pilot must counteract that yawing moment by applying rudder towards the live engine. During multi-engine training, you may come across the phrase \"dead leg = dead engine\" as the leg not doing anything is the same side as the engine which is also doing nothing, as a way to identify the failed engine. When flying with one engine inoperative, the aircraft can be kept wings level, and the rudder used to counteract the whole thrust asymmetry, or the pilot can use a small bank angle (\"5 to the live\") towards the operative engine to reduce the sideslip, and therefore reduce the amount of rudder and extra drag from the fin and fuselage. This improves aircraft climb performance, and reduces the fin and rudder loading. Therefore, banking towards the dead engine will increase the rudder loading.",

Learning Objective 081.03.01.02.06: Explain why the load factor increases in a pull-up and decreases in a push-over manoeuvre. A pull-up manoeuvre is simple and intuitive, we pull the control column, moving the elevator (trailing edge) upwards to create more downforce on the tail. This pitches the nose up, increasing the angle of attack of the wing, thereby increasing the wing's coefficient of lift, and increasing the lift force. As the lift has increased and the weight has remained the same, the load factor (Lift / Weight) increases. This is why the pilot and passengers will feel an increased G-force pushing them down into their seats during a pull-up manoeuvre, the G-force felt is the same as the load factor on the wings.",

            "explanation": "This question requires a little bit of process of elimination. In straight and level flight, there should be no angle of attack on the vertical stabiliser fin. This means that the angle of attack on the fin cannot decrease (as it is already 0 degrees) in the turn. This immediately removes the option with \"angle of attack decreases\". The angle of attack on the vertical stabiliser fin is the sideslip angle, so you cannot have \"no sideslip\" and the angle of attack increase, that is not possible, which is another option gone. Skidding turns are where too much rudder is used during a turn, and the aircraft \"skids\" through the turn, think of it like drifting a car, pointing into the turn but not going in the same direction you're pointing. This would increase the angle of attack on the fin as there is some sideslip angle, so that option is therefore gone as well. A slipping turn is the opposite of a skidding turn, and is incredibly common for new pilots. Using just ailerons to turn can often cause this, where the aircraft remains pointing forwards (not into the turn) and \"slips\" in the direction of turn. There is a sideslip angle involved here, so the angle of attack of the fin increases from straight and level flight. When your flight instructor tells you to use more rudder in the turn (step on the ball - in the slip indicator), this is what is happening. Therefore, a slipping turn with increased angle of attack is correct.",

The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight (T = D + W sin γ); and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight (L = W cos γ) For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater.

It is highly unlikely that the aircraft probes will be obstructed at the same time, to the same degree and in the same way. Abnormally large Mach number or IAS fluctuations, and differences between the indications at each pilot position, or between target and actual speed, may suggest an unreliable airspeed condition. Abnormal correlation between the basic flight parameters (pitch, thrust, airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed indications) allow the flight crew to suspect an erroneous speed/altitude indication: - The altitude does not increase, whereas there is an important nose-up pitch and high thrust - The IAS increases, whereas there is an important nose-up pitch - The IAS decreases, whereas there is an important nose-down pitch - The IAS decreases, whereas there is a nose-down pitch and the aircraft is descending. In the event of unreliable airspeed indications, a crew should fly the approximate pitch and thrust normally expected at that stage of flight until it is discovered which (if any) system is indicating correctly or the problem is resolved. Aircraft manufacturers issue appropriate guidance for specific aircraft types including pitch and thrust settings to fly at different stages of flight if airspeed information is not available. The pilots should use sources independent from the pitot static systems, capable of providing reliable information for situational awareness: - RPM (N1) for engine thrust indication - Attitude indicator - Stall warning - Ground speed and position information from Navigation systems.",

Rate of descent depends on both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path. The attached graph shows that there is greater excess drag at high speed than at low speeds. The shallowest angle of descent is achieved by staying slow. This means, that the slower speed requires a lower rate of descent to maintain the same descent path. V/S AUTOPILOT MODE Vertical Speed is an autopilot flight guidance vertical mode. In this mode, the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMCG) pitch mode guides the aircraft to the target V/S. The corresponding thrust mode is SPEED or MACH. The increase in drag associated with flap deflection requires an increased power setting in order to maintain a given airspeed and attitude, or a steady rate of descent. In conclusion: Using the V/S autopilot mode means that the autopilot is keeping a constant rate of descent. By slowing down, the vertical speed becomes excessive and the pilot must reduce the vertical speed to maintain a constant descent path. After slowing down to the approach speed, the added drag from the configuration will demand more power/thrust from the engines to keep the airspeed constant.",

The major factor that affects VMC is the difference in engine thrust. VMC will therefore be lower at higher airport elevations and at a higher OAT, due to the associated lower thrust. Conversely, VMC will be higher at lower airport elevations and at a lower OAT. If conditions are hot, high and humid the air is less dense. This reduces thrust and, consequently, when you lose the critical engine on take-off, there is less yawing effect from asymmetric thrust than there would be in denser air. Furthermore, in case of engine failure, the yaw depends on the Moment Arm. The yaw is less on engines located on the aft fuselage.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question was created from broken feedback. Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. The clues for this one were the wet runway, and the uncontrollability. If a multi-engine aircraft loses an engine during take-off, the remaining engine will produce a significant amount of asymmetry, causing a strong yawing moment towards the dead engine. This can be fought against by using the rudder, and helped also by a little nosewheel steering. However, on a wet runway, the nosewheel steering may not be effective, as hydroplaning could drastically reduce the traction of the front tyre(s) and therefore turning the nosewheel would not help the situation. This is partly why the VMCG (minimum control speed on the ground) can only be calculated using force from the rudder, as the rudder will not be affected by a wet surface, but the nosewheel might be. We have not been told if we are above VMCG or not here, but you could assume that we are not if the aircraft is \"uncontrollable\". This would result in a rejected take-off, as we are certainly below V1. Any significant yaw on take-off is usually from an engine problem. Possibly from a tyre blowout also, but that is not one of the options. Some of the other options were possibilities for causing yaw, particularly in a propeller aircraft, but they did not fit the conditions nearly as well as asymmetric thrust.",

As for the second part of the question, we're not quite sure if the feedback was talking about which way to apply your ailerons to fight the engine failure, or how to roll the wings (\"5 to the live\") to get the best performance, it was very ambiguous. We changed it very slightly to read as the second version, and it doesn't matter anyway, both answers are to the left. If the right hand engine fails, not only do you get the right hand yaw as mentioned above, but you also get an immediate roll to the right due to the secondary effect of the yaw (if you dont catch it quickly enough) and also the loss of slipstream induced lift (propeller aircraft). This means often applying left aileron as well as the left rudder. Though if you apply enough left rudder then the left aileron may not be necessary, it is a balance of both. If they are talking about which way to roll the wings, which is most likely, then banking slightly towards the operative engine, up to 5 degrees (\"5 to the live\") gives the best reduction in sideslip angle to reduce drag the most, using the weight/lift vector of the aircraft without increasing drag too much due to the bank angle. Obviously, if the right engine had failed, then the live engine is the left, so you should bank 5 degrees to that side. Either way, the answer is (1) Left; (2) Left.",

When you engage the vertical speed mode, the FD/autopilot will attempt to maintain the specified vertical speed until you choose a different setting in autopilot, the aircraft reaches an assigned altitude set into the assigned altitude selector/alerter, or the autopilot is disconnected. As the power of aircraft is limited at a certain altitude it may not be able to achieve targeted vertical speed. If you command it to climb at a greater FPM rate than your aircraft can perform at that altitude airspeed decays, the autopilot will continually pitch the aircraft up in an attempt to maintain the vertical speed selected. This could happen all the way to the point of stalling.",

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cosγ T = D + W sinγ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = T/W−D/L In this exercise, Weight is equal to 670000 N, D/L ratio is equal to 1/9 and Thrust equal to 118000 N per engine. For the all engines (two) climb gradient and applying the formula defined above: sin γ = 236000/670000−1/9 sinγ = 0.241 ⇒ sinγ = 24.1% The climb gradient is 24.1%.",

            "explanation": "In straight and level flight, an aircraft has 4 main forces acting on it. They create \"force couples\", in that Thrust cancels out Drag and Lift cancels out Weight. Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple, as, taking Lift vs Weight for instance, the two forces do not act through the same point. Weight acts through the CG, and Lift acts through the CP (Centre of Pressure), which is located behind the CG. This creates a nose-down moment (turning force) on the aircraft. There are a few ways to cancel out this moment, one we regularly see is low-mounted engines. This means that the thrust line will exist below the line of the drag, and will cause a small nose-up moment. That is not usually enough to cancel out the Lift vs Weight nose-down moment though, we need something else. Our horizontal stabiliser and elevators on the tail can be used to provide another vector of lift, but this time downwards. We often see horizontal stabilisers designed as \"upside-down wings\" to make them more efficient at producing downforce. This pushes the aircraft tail down, which creates a nose-up moment, big enough to even out the aircraft's pitch moments. Thankfully, we can modulate this by using variable incidence tailplanes and elevator trim to produce the right amount of downforce for stable flight. The downforce does act with our weight though, and means that our main wing has to produce even more lift to maintain level flight. The further forward the CG, the more downforce is required, and the greater lift. This is why aircraft are more efficient with an aft CG (within limits of course), as the less lift required means less induced drag. A forward movement of CG is therefore equivalent to an increase in mass on the stall speed (VS)",

With both engines operating at the same power setting on a twin-engine aircraft, the amount of thrust produced by each engine is identical and their lines of action are symmetrically displaced about the aircraft's normal axis. If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG. The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force).",

Turn radius is dependent on airspeed and bank angle only. However, during normal airline operations, bank angle is limited (normally to 30º) to ensure a coordinated turn with the average piloting skills. As bank angle is maximized, turn radius is a function of speed only. Therefore, should any arrival or approach area be limited by, for example, airspace structure or terrain, speed must also be limited. Alternative Explanation: ICAO Doc 8168 1.3.8 The instrument approach chart (IAC) will specify the individual categories of aircraft for which the procedure is approved. Normally, procedures will be designed to provide protected airspace and obstacle clearance for aircraft up to and including Category D. However, where airspace requirements are critical, procedures may be restricted to lower speed categories. 1.3.9 Alternatively, the procedure may specify a maximum IAS for a particular segment without reference to aircraft category. In any case, it is essential that pilots comply with the procedures and information depicted on instrument flight charts and the appropriate flight parameters shown in Tables I-4-1-1 and I-4-1-2 if the aircraft is to remain in the areas developed for obstacle clearance purposes. To stay within limits of the protected area, the radius of turn has to be restricted in order to control the physical flight path. The rate of turn implies the rate of change of heading. A certain rate of change of heading can be achieved by either modifying the TAS or the radius of turn (Rate of turn = TAS/radius of turn). Therefore, specifying a certain rate of turn alone does not guarantee the physical flight path will stay in the protected area (e.g. To stay below a certain rate of turn, the radius of turn can be increased at a constant TAS).",
