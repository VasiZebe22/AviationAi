On average, this focus point is typically between just under 1 meter and 1.5 meters, although individual variations exist. This has important implications when searching for distant targets in situations with weak visual cues because the eye is not naturally adjusted for that purpose. The presence of nearby objects, such as rain spots on the windscreen, can exacerbate this issue as the eye is naturally drawn to them. This phenomenon can occur in various conditions, including cloudless skies at high altitudes, total darkness, uniformly overcast skies, featureless terrain, large bodies of water or during relaxation. Searching out and focusing on distant points, such as the tip of the wing, or scanning the sky with the use of peripheral vision to detect and focus on other distant aircraft, help prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.",

These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness.

Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing even if the patient appears to have recovered.",

The amount of cosmic radiation you are exposed to while flying depends on four factors: altitude, latitude, and solar activity (normal and random solar activity). The fourth factor is the duration of the flight. In general, the higher the altitude and latitude and the longer the flight, the greater the radiation exposure. It is important to point that the effects of radiation are cumulative, increasing with exposure time. The Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic shield protect us from cosmic radiation. Earth’s magnetic shield protects us from the cosmic radiation and is strongest at the equator and weakest near the poles. People who live at higher latitudes are exposed to slightly more cosmic radiation than people who live at lower latitudes. At higher altitudes, people are also exposed to more radiation. The main reason is that there is less atmosphere between us and the cosmic rays. Solar events can raise radiation levels. Solar events include solar flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as other events. Solar flares are when sunspots interact with one another and cause an explosion on the Sun’s surface.",

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

On the 25th of October 1999, a SunJet Aviation Learjet 35 crashed in South Dakota, after 4 hour ghost flight through US airspace. This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter.

During descent the danger is higher, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

The pilot may feel as if the aircraft is still turning, even though it is actually straight and level. Wings level after a prolonged turn: During a prolonged turn where the aircraft remains in a banked position long enough for the hair cells in the inner ear canals to fully erect. Upon rolling out of the turn, the movement of the hair cells gives a false sensation of turning in the opposite direction, despite the aircraft being level in reality. In both scenarios described above, the pilot experiences conflicting signals: visually, they perceive the aircraft as level, while their vestibular system indicates a turning sensation. This discrepancy between what is seen and what is felt can lead to spatial disorientation and challenges in accurately perceiving the aircraft's actual orientation in flight.

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected.

For starters, none of these organs can detect speed. They detect accelerations only; some angular and some linear. The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear accelerations along every axis of the body. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation, as a linear acceleration The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis. Therefore, the vestibular system can sense linear accelerations of the body along all 3 axes using the utricle and saccule, and can sense angular accelerations of the body around all 3 axes using the semicircular canals.",

If you are hyperventilating, you might experience drowsiness, tingling sensation in the fingers and toes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, blurred vision and feelings of suffocation. In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flyinga non-pressurized aircraft above 10 000 ft without supplemental oxygen, when experiencing a rapid decompression during flight, a pressurization system malfunction, or oxygen system malfunction. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body.",

While tar and carbon monoxide are harmful components of tobacco smoke that can have severe health consequences, they are not primarily responsible for its addictive nature. Nicotine is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. When nicotine binds to these receptors, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which leads to feelings of pleasure and reward. This reinforcement of positive feelings can create a strong psychological dependence on nicotine. Nicotine is also physically addictive. Regular use of nicotine leads to the development of tolerance, meaning that over time, individuals need to consume more nicotine to achieve the same effects. Additionally, when someone tries to quit using nicotine, they often experience withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, and anxiety, which can make it challenging to quit.",

On the 25th of October 1999, a SunJet Aviation Learjet 35 crashed in South Dakota, after 4 hour ghost flight through US airspace. This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for heart diseases and stroke. Hypertension adds to your heart's workload and damages your arteries and organs over time. Hypertension puts your arteries under constant unnecessary stress, and the same as with a tyre that's been overpumped, too much force inside your blood vessels damages the artery walls and makes them weaker. The build up of various fatty deposits within the arteries is accelerated with high blood pressure, which can break off and cause risk of clogging blood vessels. Left undetected (or uncontrolled), high blood pressure can lead to: Heart attack — High blood pressure damages arteries that can become blocked and prevent blood flow to the heart muscle. Stroke — High blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the brain to clog more easily or even burst. A stroke is a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain, so is primarily caused by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain.",

Difficulty in controlling drinking behavior: Challenges in limiting the onset, termination, or levels of alcohol use once drinking has begun. Physiological withdrawal state: Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not consuming alcohol, or drinking to avoid these symptoms. Tolerance: Needing increasingly larger amounts of alcohol to achieve the same effects that were once reached with smaller quantities.

Continued use despite harmful consequences: Persisting in drinking alcohol even though it is causing or exacerbating physical, mental, or social problems. Alcoholism involves a complex interaction of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors, making it a multifaceted issue that often requires comprehensive treatment approaches. Let's examine the options provided: A middle-aged man in a highly regarded job.

Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control. Body feedback will be wrong and only by reference to the aircraft instruments can safe control of the aircraft be maintained.",

Your body has its own internal clock (circadian rhythms) that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep. Under normal circumstances, a person’s circadian rhythm aligns with daylight, promoting alertness during the day and sleep at night. This internal clock synchronizes with the 24-hour day to promote quality sleep as well as physical and mental health. A person’s geographic location affects their circadian rhythm since sunrise and sunset occur at different times in different locations. Jet lag may be experienced because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've traveled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag. Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems. One may also experience sleeping problems - It may be hard to fall asleep when you want to, or you may wake up earlier than planned. Jet lag can also cause sleep to be fragmented. It is a temporary disorder. For example, if you fly from Los Angeles to New York and arrive at 8 p.m., your body might still operate as if it’s in L. A. at 5 p.m. This jet lag can cause you to stay up later than you’d like, sleep at odd hours, or feel more tired than usual, among other symptoms.",

They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

            "explanation": "The auditory system is comprised of three components; the outer, middle, and inner ear, all of which work together to transfer sounds from the environment to the brain. THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate. THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid. Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns.",

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. It can stem from different factors. Social factors can contribute to a person’s views of drinking. Your culture, religion, family and work influence many of your behaviors, including drinking. Family plays the biggest role in a person’s likelihood of developing alcoholism. Children who are exposed to alcohol abuse from an early age are more at risk of falling into a dangerous drinking pattern. Researchers have examined whether or not a person’s proximity to alcohol retail stores or bars affect their chances of alcoholism. People who live closer to alcohol establishments are said to have a more positive outlook on drinking and are more likely to participate in the activity. Different psychological factors may increase the chances of heavy drinking. Every person handles situations in their own unique way. However, how you cope with these feelings can impact certain behavioral traits. For example, people with high stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions are more vulnerable to developing alcoholism. In these types of circumstances, alcohol is often used to suppress feelings and relieve the symptoms of psychological disorders. Abundant evidence indicates that alcoholism is a complex genetic disease, with variations in a large number of genes affecting risk. Some of these genes have been identified, including two genes of alcohol metabolism, ADH1B and ALDH2, that have the strongest known affects on risk for alcoholism. Studies are revealing other genes in which variants impact risk for alcoholism or related traits.",

RESPIRATION Our body's cells need to create energy to power their normal processes. This energy comes from a process called respiration, and is split into two parts. The process of internal respiration is where our blood capillaries pass fresh oxygen (O2) to the cells that require it to create energy. It is also where the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) transfers from our cells to the blood capillaries, as it is a waste product of the energy creation process. The blood is used to transfer the oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the bodies, between the lungs and the cells and back again. External respiration is the name of a process by the lungs, where fresh oxygen diffuses into the capillaries of the bloodstream from the alveoli in the lungs. The opposite process also occurs in the same place, where carbon dioxide diffuses from the bloodstream to the air in the lungs. Alveoli are small sponge like sacks that allow a large transfer of fresh oxygen (O2) and waste carbon dioxide (CO2), they have extremely high surface areas for maximum exchange of useful and waste gases.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

This disturbance of the acid balance has a number of effects, the major one being that haemoglobin gives up its oxygen readily only in an acid medium. As a result, tissues suffer from lack of O2.",

The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach with the risk of striking objects along the approach path or landing short. A wider than usual runway can create an illusion the aircraft is lower than it actually is, leading to a higher approach. Summary: When flying into a runway that is wider than you are used to, you’re prone to thinking you are lower than you actually are. When there is so much runway filling your perifiery, you assume you’re just about to touch down. This causes pilots to flare too high.",

            "explanation": "The auditory system is comprised of three components; the outer, middle, and inner ear, all of which work together to transfer sounds from the environment to the brain. THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate (1). THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid (2). Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns (3).",

The CNS is also responsible for higher-order functions such as cognition, memory, decision-making, and consciousness. 2.

It serves as a communication network between the CNS and the body's sensory receptors, muscles, and glands. The PNS has two main divisions: the sensory (afferent) division, which transmits sensory information from the body to the CNS, and the motor (efferent) division, which transmits commands from the CNS to muscles and glands. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): The ANS is a subpart of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and is responsible for regulating involuntary bodily functions and maintaining homeostasis. It controls various internal organs and processes such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The ANS has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system (which prepares the body for \"fight or flight\" responses) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which promotes \"rest and digest\" functions).",

Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lightning, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision.",

            "explanation": "AUTOMATION Cockpit automation has the potential to increase or decrease the flight safety, depending on how well you use the equipment. Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

There are three stages: Alarm, Resistance, and Exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible.

The 55 year old Co-Pilot, who used to be a senior commander, recently joined the Operator, and has logged 11 200 total flight hours (also with 1 500 on type). The Co-Pilot is Pilot Flying on approach. Below the Minimum Descent Altitude the crew still do NOT have sufficient visual contact with the runway. The Ground Proximity Warning System then sounds, \"too low terrain\". The Co-Pilot says: \"We're going to make it\", and continues the approach, instead of starting the mandatory go-around procedure. The commander does NOT challenge the decision of the Co-Pilot and does NOT take control of the aircraft.

Some high-status individuals find it difficult or are uncomfortable to move to a perceived “lower” role. This may generate a mismatch between status and role. The commander may also feel that they are less qualified to make decisions than the more experienced co-pilot, and therefore may fail to assert their authority in a situation such as this one. It must be remembered that hours should not determine role on the flight deck. It is important to keep in mind that the final decision always lies with the captain. In this case, due to the perceived inversion of the authority gradient, the captain has failed to make the safety critical decision that was required. The answer which states that the cockpit authority gradient is too steep is not correct; the cockpit gradient became inverted and the commander could have asserted their higher authority over the co-pilot, regardless of hours, but failed to do so in this scenario.",

On conducting a twin engine aircraft pre-flight, the commander notices an oil leak but decides NOT to have a maintenance engineer look at it. This is certainly NOT good pre-planning or anticipation, and is in blatant disregard for flight safety. An oil leak is a potential for an engine failure or fire, either due to the damage that has caused it, or due to the consequent lack of oil. A good choice would be to check the cause with an engineer at the very least, and make sure fill up the oil and check the gauges in flight regularly on the way to get it fixed. 2. There is a full load of passengers and fuel. The flight is to depart at midday. The temperature is slightly higher than forecast. The Commander re-does the performance calculations and decides to delay the departure. An increase in temperature leads to a reduced air density, causing reduced engine and aerodynamic performance, so, by delaying the flight to a less warm time of the day, the pilot can have a greater safety margin, a good choice. 3. During a VFR flight, approaching high ground, the cloud base is lower than forecast. There is insufficient fuel to divert around and the flight must remain VFR. The Commander decides to turn back. Whilst this is a good choice in the moment, the pilot did not plan for this or anticipate it ahead of time and, by not having enough fuel, they made themselves unable to carry on with the flight. High ground with clouds is not good for VFR aircraft, and the pilot should have accounted for this.",

The controller replied \"OK, stand by for take-off\".

It could be corporate culture or perhaps body language. Explicit communication rules are about what a manager says or writes and are usually very direct, clear, and straightforward. \"Do this\" and \"Don't do that\" count as examples of explicit communication. With explicit communication, the receiver can immediately detect the meaning of the message without much interpretation. Even though, the crew was wrong by initiating the take off roll after only hearing \"OK\" - the technical limitation of VHF communication and multiple transmissions is what lead to the entire message not being heard. This is an example of explicit communication between the crew and ATC => prone to technical limitation. Note: The correct option has been updated recently after a number of feedback. Nevertheless, we encourage everyone who comes across this question in their official exams to report it back to us.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.03.01.03.04: State the average maximum number of separate items that may be held in working memory (5 ± 2). There are three main levels of memory, the sensory store (very short), the working memory (short-term) and the long-term memory. The information given in this message needs to be stored in the working memory. The capacity of the working memory is limited to 5 +/- 2 items (7 +/- 2 according to the old syllabus), which can be stored for an average period of 15 to 20 seconds. Some information can last in short-term memory for up to a minute if rehearsal strategies are used. The information in short-term memory is also highly susceptible to interference. Any new information that enters short-term memory will quickly displace old information. Similar items in the environment can also interfere with short-term memories. A process called chunking (creating information chunks, made up of individual items) can increase the amount that can be stored in the working memory, but does take some thought. This answer is the most correct of the options, but it is a little debatable as to whether each digit is considered a \"separate item\" within the working memory model. Nonetheless, if you received this message from ATC, your working memory would be full or nearly full by the end, making pilots prone to making mistakes. This scenario would likely not be time limited, but probably limited by the number of items to remember (more than the maximum of about 7). The time problem may come later on as, if the various information is not inputted into the aircraft within the time limit of the working memory, the pilot may be left guessing at what they thought ATC had said. This can be helped by noting down long clearances immediately, or asking ATC for clarification. Also, we do not really want to commit this to our long term memory, we just want to make it last long enough to input into our aircraft's systems and check that input. This information could easily be committed to long-term memory, given the amount of data and time available, but we do not want to do that. Note: any feedback on this question would be very useful to validate the options given. Exam feedback can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.",

An ergonomic source of error is, for example, cockpit noise and the restriction of the field of view due to windscreen design. Ideally, the principle of design ensures that the job required should be fitted to the man rather than the man to the job – this is not always the case. Economics.

Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

            "explanation": "As the name implies, hypovigilance is a state of diminished vigilance and attention, which reduces, among others, the abilities to direct attention and to perform multiple tasks at the same time. Hypovigilance is characterised by a decrease in sensory perception. Consequently, a higher level of sensory stimulation is required to get a person's attention. A sensation of muscular heaviness is also a sign of hypovigilance. However, both are usually not noticed by the hypovigilant person. Visible signs of reduced vigilance would include reduced movements and low muscular tension, which can be seen, for example, in the fact that the person's mouth is slightly open. Hypovigilance can be usually expected in modern aeroplanes, especially during long flights where only monotonous tasks, which do not sufficiently stimulate the nervous system, are required of the pilot and periods without any events are experienced.",

Two-way communication is a process in which information flows in two directions: from sender to receiver and back again. In this type of communication, both parties participate actively by sending messages and providing feedback. This exchange ensures that the message is understood correctly, allows for clarification, and fosters a mutual understanding. Two-way communication is characterized by interaction, engagement, and a continuous feedback loop, making it effective for persuasion, command, informing, and ensuring accurate information transfer. Two-way communication requires learning because it involves not only conveying information but also actively listening, interpreting feedback, and adjusting one's own message accordingly. Effective communication demands the ability to articulate thoughts clearly and to understand the nuances of language and non-verbal cues. Learning these skills enables individuals to engage meaningfully in dialogue, facilitating productive interactions.",

The commander is demonstrating a strong autocratic leadership style which consists of a management style wherein the commander controls all the decisions and takes very little inputs from the co-pilot. Autocracy can be sometimes used in small amounts on the flight deck depending on the personalities of the crew, but this situation is far too much, and the commander is demonstrating terrible CRM (Crew Resource Management). The co-pilot is acting as a bad follower. They should be more assertive to the commander in this scenario, to make the commander listen, as this would help the situation, and potentially save lives in the subsequent ditching (or avoid it altogether perhaps). Obviously, the commander is more at fault here, but the co-pilot could be more assertive to make themself a \"good follower\".",

Individuals with a non-assertive personality often exhibit submissive or passive behavior, avoiding confrontation and prioritizing the needs of others over their own. They may struggle to assert boundaries, say \"no,\" or communicate their thoughts and feelings openly. Non-assertiveness is typically associated with a lack of self-confidence, fear of rejection or conflict, and a tendency to prioritize harmony and avoid potential discomfort or confrontation AUTOCRATIC PILOT An autocratic pilot is characterized by their dominant control in the cockpit. They make decisions without seeking input or considering the opinions of other crew members. Delegation is rare, as they prefer to handle tasks themselves. Instead of offering constructive guidance, they tend to make general comments that provide little educational value. They exhibit a lack of listening skills and isolation from the rest of the crew. Suggestions presented with force are often perceived as criticism or insubordination. Overall, an autocratic pilot fosters an atmosphere of tension and limited communication within the cockpit. FOLLOWERSHIP Followership guidelines are essential for effective collaboration and teamwork in any setting. As a follower, it is crucial to openly express any uncertainties or anxieties without delay, as others may share the same concerns and appreciate your honesty. When asked for your point of view, provide it fully and clearly, without worrying about whether it aligns with others' expectations. Avoid expressing opinions in an emotionally or dominant manner and refrain from becoming overly attached to your own perspective, prioritizing the collective decision-making process instead. If a group decision has been reached, accept it unless you genuinely believe it poses a hazard that others may have overlooked. Actively prevent others from pursuing incorrect courses of action that could lead to trouble, without letting personal pride dictate your actions. Avoid competition, anger, shouting, sulking, or displaying a negative mood on the flight deck. Strive to maintain a pleasant working atmosphere, even if you may not necessarily agree with or like your fellow crew members. At the described scenario the Commander does not take into account the Co-pilot's opinion in the decision-making process, choosing an autocratic leadership style. On the other hand, the Co-Pilot demonstrates weak followership skills by not assertively advocating for their valid observations and concerns.",

The reason for this is that different tasks and responsibilities within a group require different skills, expertise, and perspectives. By taking on different roles, group members can specialize in specific areas of the tasks and achieve the group's goals based on their abilities and interests, which leads to a more efficient distribution of labor and enhances the overall group performance. These roles can include leadership roles, task-oriented roles, social support roles, or roles that involve specific expertise or knowledge.

For instance, the experienced aviator, with his/her mental model of the order of information in an RT message and his/her expectation of the potential content, will have far fewer problems understanding the information than a novice. However, in this lies the danger of expectation. For example, if a pilot is regularly cleared to cross a particular runway during operations at a familiar aerodrome, he/she may come to “expect” the clearance. This could cause a potentially dangerous situation if on a particular day, the pilot actually is instructed not to cross the runway in question due to another aircraft landing or taking off.

Mode confusion can also occur when the flight crew does not fully understand the behavior of the automation in certain modes or how different modes interact, i.e., when the crew have a poor “mental model” of the automation. Mode confusion is what happened in this situation. The mode automatically changed from LNAV to VNAV but the pilots did not understand the implications of this and that the aircraft will no longer follow the desired flight path.",

            "explanation": "AUTOMATION Cockpit automation has the potential to increase or decrease the flight safety, depending on how well you use the equipment. Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

            "explanation": "(1) \"Nervousness and channelised attention\" Correct. Any pilot, irrespective of age, may experience mental blocks, confusion, nervousness and channelised attention when under stress. (2) \"Being rough at the controls\" Correct. When a student begins flight training, they often struggle to emotionally and physically relax, one of the reasons behind this is the lack of confidence. Some common student pilot errors include holding the controls too firmly. Too tight of a grip on the controls prevents the pilot from feeling the airplane, shifting winds and the necessary control inputs required to obtain a certain attitude. (3) \"Smoke and Drink much more alcohol than usual\" Incorrect. This is a manifestation of excessive stress => typically not the case of a student pilot. (4) \"Airsickness, lack of sleep.\" Incorrect. In this case, we are asked about naturally induced stress, and not extreme cases. Excessive stress may lead to sickness but usually student pilots get airsick because their body is not used to the aircraft's movements during flight, which is more a physiological problem rather than a psychological one. Lack of sleep can be correct. For example, if the student is nervous because of a demanding flight/exam flight the following day, she/he may not sleep well the night before.",

Acute fatigue – short-term, more intense which usually affects the body, and just needs a good nights’ sleep to sort things out. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. Chronic fatigue typically happens after you’ve had no rest for some time and the body’s energy level cannot be restored after normal or increased periods of sleep. Coping with the impact of chronic stress can be challenging. Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning.

Motor programmes enables an individual to perform more than one task at the same time by freeing mental resources – this way, one task can be performed requiring conscious attention, while performing another one at an unconscious level (motor programme). According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

Hypovigilance is characterized by a decrease in sensory perception. Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks. Techniques to avoid the state of hypovigilance can be exercised during long-haul flights, since monotony in the cockpit may create such circumstances. In a multi-crew operation, it is advisable to engage in communication with the other crew member to remain active. It is also possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. Controlled rest will help the crew maintain effectiveness. Turning on the lights may also help during night flights, but the crew should keep in mind that their night vision will be affected. Since the question does not mention anything about night flying, we consider the answer \"Communicate with each other and take it in turns to have periods of relaxation\" to be the correct one.",

A briefing is designed to provide information quickly and effectively. Of standard type/standard sequence of briefing items. Elements always appear in the same sequence, and meet the expectations of the receiver who is used to that sequence making it easy to spot an omission. Understood by all crew members. A simple but well-understood plan of action, supported by all is preferable to a possibly brilliant but misunderstood plan. All in-flight briefings should be conducted by the pilot flying to inform the pilot monitoring of the planned course of action. The optimum time for an in-flight briefing is a period of low workload shortly before the briefed event occurs.",

Anxiety, on the other hand, is typically linked to emotional instability, tension, and suspiciousness. It's important to note that extraversion and anxiety are not directly related to each other, meaning that some individuals may be both anxious and extroverted, while others may be anxious and introverted. Individuals with an anxious personality are more likely to experience stress as they tend to worry and anticipate negative outcomes.

Mode Awareness is used to describe a situation where the pilots are aware of the active mode(s) and understand the corresponding actions and responses which are necessary for proper use of the automated system. It consists of the awareness of the existence of different automation levels and the awareness of the currently active mode. Similar to situational awareness, mode awareness is established by the perception and correct interpretation of system information, the build-up of knowledge and finally, the prediction of future system behaviour. The opposite of mode awareness is mode confusion. Mode confusion occurs when the flight crew believes the automation is in a mode different than the one it is actually in and consequently make inappropriate requests or responses to the automation. It can be described as a kind of automation surprise, where the system does not behave according to the user’s expectations. In the case of mode confusion, the user loses track of which system is currently active or what kind of behaviour is appropriate for which mode. Mode confusion can also occur when the flight crew does not fully understand the behaviour of the automation in certain modes or how different modes interact, i.e., when the crew have a poor “mental model” of the automation. Mode confusion is what happened in this situation. The SPEED mode \"dropped out\" and the pilots were not aware, they now had an incorrect mental model of the automation, and were therefore incorrect in how they expected the aircraft to act. In a broader sense, it could also be classed as a lack of situational awareness.",

Stress is a natural human reaction and it is not always negative! A certain moderate amount of stress is beneficial to human performance - it stops you slowing down and keeps you on your toes – this is the sort associated with success. Unnecessary stress, such as an upcoming examination, can also be bad for the person's performance in day-to-day activities, as is well known by all who have had to deal with stressful scenarios. Stress is a very subjective matter – every individual is different and stress reactions as well as their magnitudes differ from person to person. The individual level of stress depends on the individual’s subjective perception of available abilities and comparing them to the situational demands. How good do we think we are versus how good we think we need to be. In this case, the question is asking about the different types of stressors/stress factors. Stress can occur from the following types of factors: Physiological. Cognitive. Non-professional. Imaginary. Organizational. Imaginary stress is when we suffer from stress without a real stressor being present. It is the anxiety about a potential future risk, formed from a belief or previous experience. As the risk of a pilot losing their medical is quite a large one, imaginary stress can manifest itself prior to a medical, even if the pilot has nothing wrong that should cause an issue, such as in this scenario.",

            "explanation": "Top-down perception comes into play when you make a scene fit what you expect it to be, rather than perceive reality. These perceptions are heavily influenced by our expectations, prior knowledge and past experiences in particular. For example, when two similar objects (of different sizes) are viewed from the same distance away, our brain has prior knowledge that those objects should be the same size, giving us that expectation. This influences our mind very heavily in top-down processing, and makes us perceive that the smaller object is actually the same size, but further away from us. Top-down processing therefore can cover up inconsistencies in our perception of things, and whilst it is fast, it is not always the most accurate. There are two answers here which look very similar, the first is the correct answer; Comparing data stored in the brain with the new precepted information, critically disguising inconsistent details, and the second is; Comparing data stored in the brain with the new precepted information, possibly adding missing data. We have already discussed why the first answer is correct, however, the second answer looks very similar, but is subtly different. The way we read the second answer, we believe it to be saying that missing data is added to the data that is already stored in the brain, and this would be the wrong way round. What actually happens is that sometimes, extra data is added from the memory to \"fill in the gaps\" of our perception, and that is what can create mistakes. Of course, with a different interpretation, it could be considered right, but we would still mark the first answer as correct, as there is no need for interpretation, therefore making it more correct.",

After methodical training, a rate of 1 to 100 is considered to be realistic and pretty good. A checklist can be used to reduce the effects of human memory and attention limitations by ensuring consistency and completeness. In order for a checklist to provide valuable assistance for crew members, certain design criteria should be observed: The most critical items on the task-checklist should be listed as close as possible to the beginning of the task-checklist, in order to increase the likelihood of completing the item before interruptions may occur. The more items a checklist has, the more likely one of them is forgotten. A long checklist should be subdivided to smaller task-checklists or chunks that can be associated with systems and functions within the cockpit. Division of pages should be obtained with protruding thumb locators. Sequencing of checklist items should follow the “geographical” organization of the items in the cockpit, and be performed in a logical flow (panel scan sequence). We note that this guideline could conflict with Nos. 1 above. In most cases where this occurs, this guideline (No. 3) should take precedence. The most critical items should be emphasized by use of colour, bold, italics or upper case. Checklists should be designed in such a way that their execution will not be tightly coupled with other tasks - to ensure maximum attention is devoted to the checklist execution. Check lists should be unambiguous and easy to read, presented in easily understood language.",

HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES Studies have identified five hazardous attitudes among pilots that can interfere with a pilot’s ability to make effective decisions. ANTI-AUTHORITY (“don’t tell me”) – You display this attitude if you resent having someone tell you what to do, or you regard rules and procedures as unnecessary. Antidote – Follow the rules. They are usually right. IMPULSIVITY (“do it quickly”) – If you feel the need to act immediately and do the first thing that comes to mind without considering the best solution to a problem, then you are exhibiting impulsivity. Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men, contrary to some misconceptions. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible. This feeling can cause you to leave the action to others – for better or worse. Antidote – I am not helpless. I can make a difference. COMPLACENCY (\"It's never happened to me before\") - The gradual reduction in safety standards, due to the increased experience of the pilot, leading to a lack of awareness of safety risks. Antidote – It hasn't happened to me yet, but it still could.",

            "explanation": "This is one of those slightly subjective questions that aren't always easy to answer. You rather have to get in the mindset of the examiner and look for what they want. The feedback we have agrees with our current answer. The communication process typically starts with the sender who initiates the message. Before the sender releases the message, they have to generate the idea and then encode it reasonably so that the receiver can easily understand it. The process of encoding is modulated by the sender's idea of the receiver's competence to decode it. The sender then sends the message, using both verbal and non-verbal communication to transmit more information that the receiver can decode. One of the most important parts about communication is after the message has been sent and received. This is the time at which the receiver will give feedback, either by words, or an expression, gesture, etc. to tell you that the message has been received, and often their understanding of it, which the sender can check. Particularly on the flight deck, where miscommunications can have drastic effects, it is very important for the sender to check for this feedback, to see if the message has been fully transported to the receiver, and if they have understood it correctly. The other options are incorrect, as; Speaking louder is not a good method of communication. Implicit communication our face, body language, tone of voice (non-verbal communications) can be used without the need for explicit communications. Professional language has its place, but sometimes, informal language can be better used to convey a message in a particular way.",

Two-way communication: Two-way communication, on the other hand, involves an interactive exchange of information between the sender and the receiver. It allows for feedback, questions, and responses from the receiver, creating a dialogue or conversation. Effective communication must be two-way. This enables the transmitter's intentions to be clarified as needed. It is why reading back information on the radio, asking questions when uncertain, and fostering an environment that encourages questioning and critical thinking are essential. Two-way communication ensures that information is effectively conveyed and understood by both the transmitter and the receiver. It allows for clarification and confirmation of messages, reducing the chances of miscommunication or misunderstanding. Two-way communication promotes an atmosphere where all individuals involved in the communication process feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, asking questions, and seeking clarification. This open environment encourages active participation and engagement, leading to better teamwork, cooperation, and mutual understanding among crew members.",

CRM is not so much concerned with the technical knowledge and skills required to fly and operate an aircraft but rather with the cognitive and interpersonal skills needed to manage the flight within an organised aviation system.

Blake and Jane Mouton, leadership styles can be characterized by two dimensions; Task-orientation and Relationship-orientation. Relationship-orientation: Relationship-oriented leaders are primarily focused on supporting, motivating and developing individuals and teams through collaborative working. Relationship-oriented leaders seek to establish meaningful relationships with their staff. He/she tends to first consider how others will feel and only then he will consider getting the task done. Task-orientation: Perhaps the most concise definition of task-oriented leadership is “doing whatever it takes to get the job done.” The first consideration is given to the task or goal in the decision-making process. The approach tends to be autocratic and emphasizes completing tasks required to meet organizational goals. An ideal professional pilot should be able to move between task and relationship depending on the situation and person involved. An effective leader must have the ability and willingness to switch between task behaviour and relationship behaviour when the situation calls for it. He/she will therefore find the appropriate and correct balance between relationship and task orientation style. In this case, the question clearly states that he is \"primarily interested in a friendly atmosphere within his crew\". This should tell us that, in doubt, he will pay more attention to happiness of his crew members than to the quick completion of tasks => Relationship-oriented.",

Unfortunately, the opposite is often true. Both the aural and visual alerts can be perceived to reduce the need for crew communication, as every relevant deviation is reported by the automation and effective cross-checking and callouts are sometimes neglected. The reduced necessity for communication can make it difficult for the other pilot to detect an erraneous entry. Consequently, he or she may be surprised by aircraft performance or may be unable to detect and understand the cause of an error. In the worst case, this could probably even result in loss of situational awareness, when a pilot is not sufficiently informed about the aircraft status or position. Note: What is (presumably) meant is that pilots may FEEL that the need for communication and cross-check is reduced because the system will alert them to all undesired conditions.",

The behaviour of a group can be affected by a number of factors including: Persuasion. Refers to the process of changing attitudes, opinions and behaviours of other group members. In contrast to negotiation, which implies retreating and meeting somewhere in the middle, persuasion means to make people completely abandon their point of view to accept the persuader's one. Pilots should not suppress opinions which could lead to a better outcome. Conformity. Concerns the likelihood of an individual to go along with a group decision. The idea of being integrated into the team, to be recognised as a leader, or to avoid conflicts, may lead to a disposition to agree with decisions made by others. This tendency increases when new people enter an existing group. This poses the threat for the group to lose valuable input, as it becomes difficult to voice an alternate opinion. Compliance. Compliant behaviour is shown in groups when requested by another group memeber or the leader. The aim being to be socially accepted, receive a reward or avoid punishment. Obedience. Being obedient means following the orders of someone with a higher social status just because the orders were given. Crew members should remain prepared to challenge orders if they are believed to be suboptimal.",

            "explanation": "PERCEPTION Perception is the process of giving meaning to what is sensed, or interpreting, organising and elaborating on the input, discarding anything non-relevant. Sensory stimulation is the first stage in the information process, and the basis of perception is the intensity of the stimulus. Perception therefore happens in the brain, after a stimulus has been detected by the sense organs. What each individual perceives results from interplays between past experiences and the interpretation of the perceived. It is important to note that perception is highly resistant to correction and can be persuasive. Once you are convinced that you have found the correct interpretation for your perceptions, your brain tends to adjust your new perceptions to your mental picture of the situation. American Airlines Flight in 1997: The aircraft was in a holding pattern. The airborne weather radar showed heavy precipitation in the vicinity of the holding point. Busy assessing the weather ahead, the crew did not notice that they had accidently pulled back the throttle levers (below the auto throttle minimum), causing the auto throttle to disengage. The airspeed decreased and, once again, the crew failed to notice this indication. Upon experiencing aerodynamic stall buffet, the crew interpreted it as turbulence. As the aircraft stalled, the crew assumed they were facing wind shear and performed the wind shear escape manoeuvre. They were able to recover and land safely. They were only made aware that the aircraft had stalled by the NTSB inspectors.",

This type of memory allows us to hold onto information for a brief period and will be forgotten within 10 to 20 seconds if not actively rehearsed and consciously transferred into our long-term memory. Our STM has a limited capacity. It can typically hold a maximum of about 7 ± 2 unrelated items. Once this capacity is exceeded, it becomes likely that one or more of the items will be lost or mixed up. STM is also highly sensitive to interruptions. Long-Term Memory (LTM) is the second type of memory. When information in the short-term memory is rehearsed, it is transferred into the long-term memory. Our LTM has unlimited capacity. Information stored in LTM can be retained indefinitely, although there may be difficulties in retrieving it. One significant drawback is the time it takes to access this information, if not regurarly rehearsed. LTM consists of information that can be categorized into three distinct types: 1. Semantic memory 2. Episodic memory 3. Procedural memory",

An overstressed pilot may show mental blocks, confusion, channelized attention, resignation, frustration, rage, and deterioration in motor coordination. To avoid such situations, one should be ahead of the game by anticipating - “if this happens, I will do XX”. It is good to anticipate possible scenarios and threats that could arise during the flight. This will reduce the surprise factor if something does happen. Anticipating what might happen is not enough. It is important that once all reasonable scenarios and threats are identified, a sound plan for dealing with them is made on the ground before flight. Sometimes, even if you anticipate and plan, you may still find yourself in an overwhelming situation. To successfully manage this, you should make the best use of any resource available to you, which include your own body (physical and psychological factors), information, equipment, other people (fellow crew member, ATC) and automation. An important procedure is the careful distribution of tasks in the cockpit and other resources, such as onboard equipment and ATC, cab always help by providing information and advice that will help you deal with the situation and reduce stress levels. It is also paramount to prioritize tasks - rate tasks by how important or urgent they are and get the most critical ones done first. Emergencies must also be rehearsed because, when under stress, you may revert to former training.",

Risky shift is a phenomenon in which a group of individuals tends to make riskier decisions collectively compared to the average risk preference of individual group members. In other words, when people make decisions as a group, they often lean towards adopting a riskier course of action than they would have taken individually. This shift towards greater risk-taking can occur due to several factors, such as diffusion of responsibility, social comparison, and the desire to conform to group norms or maintain harmony within the group. The group dynamic and the influence of others can amplify individual risk preferences and lead to a collective inclination towards riskier choices. Regarding this question, a group of 3 pilots will tend to make riskier decisions than the decisions the pilots would make individually if the aircraft was a single-pilot aircraft.",

The options are then considered, with a quick analysis of each, including the associated risks, the benefits, the potential time taken, the capability of the crew and aircraft to perform the action, commercial factors, etc. Then a decision is made, actions are taken, and the decision and actions are continuously reviewed then for changes or improvements, until the issue is solved. The hierarchy of the crew should not affect the strength of a suggestion, as each suggestion is potentially valid, and should be analysed as such (of course the Commander must make the final decision in most cases).

Different strategies exist to discover misunderstandings, de-escalate a situation and restore appreciative relationship. Active listening. Active listening is a way of listening and responding to another person that improves mutual understanding. This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the complete message being communicated. One can demonstrate that he/she is listening by smiling, nodding to show one has understood or saying “yes” or “mhh” to encourage him/her to continue.",

This can have a negative impact on a group, leading to a lack of criticism of potentially bad decisions. \"Cohesion\" Correct. Group cohesion is the linking of group members with a common objective. It generally goes hand-in-hand with a shared attitude towards problems and is based upon the mutual motivation of the crew towards the job. It can have major advantages in difficult situations over a non-cohesive group. \"Risky Shift\" Risky shift is a commonly observed phenomenon that occurs when people change their decisions or opinions to become more extreme and risky when acting as part of a group, compared with acting individually. This is obviously not good for aviation. \"Dominance\" Whilst the commander should be the one who makes the final decisions and leads the crew, it is not good for them to assert too much dominance, as this can lead to the rest of the team feeling worried to speak up on issues, or challenge bad decisions, etc.",

For instance, the experienced aviator, with his/her mental model of the order of information in an RT message and his/her expectation of the potential content, will have far fewer problems understanding the information than a novice. However, in this lies the danger of expectation. For example, if a pilot is regularly cleared to cross a particular runway during operations at a familiar aerodrome, he/she may come to “expect” the clearance. This could cause a potentially dangerous situation if on a particular day, the pilot actually is instructed not to cross the runway in question due to another aircraft landing or taking off. An inherent danger in this system is that, having built a mental model, we will tend to seek only information that confirms our model (confirmation bias) and ignore other information that may cast doubt on its accuracy.",

Conflicting goals and bad management decisions unknowingly create the conditions under which the latentfailures can reveal themselves. Active failures are related to direct supervision, scheduling, use of resources, time management, and communication. Active failures are errors and violations having immediate negative results and are usually caused by an individual. Active failures created by the individual include: omission of a checklist item use of wrong procedures not following procedures not completing a final system check properly not double checking lack of skill and knowledge In short, an active failure equals - human error, sometimes referred to - operator error. Whilst a latent failure is a management failure, which could be a lack of training, supervision, proper procedures, wrong or faulty equipment and so on. Note: “The aircraft technician fails to follow all the steps on the job card and forgets to reconnect the altimeter’s static port during a routine maintenance check.” INCORRECT. This is an active error which will be immediately recognized by the crew.",

During normal operations, the procedures and tasks for the PF and PM in the various flight phases are well described and evenly distributed. With good use of the available automation, the level of workload is such that spare capacity to maintain situational awareness is available. However if an unexpected situation occurs which requires extra attention, the workload can increase considerably. When there is intense workload, instead of immediate reprogramming, pilots are advised to reduce the level of automation to a more basic mode. This way, the negative effects of automation on pilots may be alleviated by degrading to a lower level of automation to recover comprehension of the flight status from VNAV/LNAV to ALT/HDG or even to manual flying. Note: downgrading automation is a good idea, however reverting to manual flight would use up too many resources during an approach to a busy airport. However, EASA seems to include \"manual flight\" in their correct answer. In our opinion, flying manually would only be an option in case of a suspected malfunction of automated systems.",

An overstressed pilot may show mental blocks, confusion, channelized attention, resignation, frustration, rage, and deterioration in motor coordination. To avoid such situations, one should be ahead of the game by anticipating - “if this happens, I will do XX”. It is good to anticipate possible scenarios and threats that could arise during the flight. This will reduce the surprise factor if something does happen. Anticipating what might happen is not enough. It is important that once all reasonable scenarios and threats are identified, a sound plan for dealing with them is made on the ground before flight. Sometimes, even if you anticipate and plan, you may still find yourself in an overwhelming situation. To successfully manage this, you should make the best use of any resource available to you, which include your own body (physical and psychological factors), information, equipment, other people (fellow crew member, ATC) and automation. An important procedure is the careful distribution of tasks in the cockpit and other resources, such as onboard equipment and ATC, cab always help by providing information and advice that will help you deal with the situation and reduce stress levels. It is also paramount to prioritize tasks - rate tasks by how important or urgent they are and get the most critical ones done first. Emergencies must also be rehearsed because, when under stress, you may revert to former training.",

Multi-crew training is primarily focused on enhancing crew communication skills among flight personnel working together in the cockpit. This involves effective interaction, coordination, and communication between the pilot and co-pilot or other crew members. \"Situational Awareness\": This refers to the ability of the flight crew to have a clear understanding of their environment, including the aircraft's position, current situation, and potential risks. Effective multi-crew training improves the crew's ability to gather, process, and maintain situational awareness. \"Crew Communication\": Clear and efficient communication among the flight crew is crucial to ensure that everyone understands their roles, tasks, and the current situation. Multi-crew training focuses on developing effective communication techniques, using standardized procedures to convey information accurately and promptly. \"Cross Checking\": Cross checking involves verifying critical information through multiple sources. Flight crew members work together to confirm the accuracy of data, settings, and actions. Multi-crew training emphasizes the importance of cross checking to prevent errors and improve overall safety. \"Crew Coordination\": Crew coordination involves the harmonious interaction between various crew members, including pilots, flight engineers, and other relevant personnel. Effective coordination ensures that everyone is on the same page, contributing to smooth operations and prompt decision-making. The option \"arousal control\" does not directly align with the primary goals of multi-crew training. Arousal control pertains to managing stress and maintaining a focused state, this is important but is not the primary focus of multi-crew training.",

This can make it difficult to concentrate. A way to correct this is to consume small snacks, preferably containing easily accessible complex sugars.

Some effective conflict-resolution techniques include: Acknowledging that a difficult situation exists and active listening. Honesty and clear communication play an important role in the resolution process. Acquaint yourself with what's happening and be open about the problem. It is also important to have the desire to understand the different point of view of the other person. Determining the underlying need. The goal of conflict resolution is not to decide which person is right or wrong; the goal is to reach a solution that everyone can live with. Looking first for needs, rather than solutions, is a powerful tool for generating win/win options. To discover needs, you must try to find out why people want the solutions they initially proposed. Once you understand the advantages their solutions have for them, you have discovered their needs. Find common areas of agreement and express mutual expectations, no matter how small: Agree on the problem Agree on the procedure to follow Agree on worst fears Agree on some small change to give an experience of success \"1. realise but be indifferent to the conflict\" Incorrect. Avoiding is when people just ignore or withdraw from the conflict. They choose this method when the discomfort of confrontation exceeds the potential reward of resolution of the conflict. While this might seem easy to accommodate for the facilitator, people aren’t really contributing anything of value to the conversation and may be withholding worthwhile ideas.

This includes aspects such as national and company culture. In certain cultural set-ups, other crew members tend not to challenge the decision of the commander, finding it difficult to speak up. Ergonomics. (designed related) The pilot’s workplace is designed such that below-optimum conditions exist for him to perform all required tasks. An ergonomic source of error is, for example, cockpit noise and the restriction of the field of view due to windscreen design. Ideally, the principle of design ensures that the job required should be fitted to the man rather than the man to the job – this is not always the case. Economics. Pilots are required to make operation as economic as possible. Such pressure can result in incautious decisions. Errors due to economics can include, for instance, the use of poor and cheap equipment.",

Acute stress activates the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), where physical, emotional and mental resources are mobilized to fight stress. Acute fatigue often results from lack of sleep, therefore the most important measure to prevent fatigue-related performance loss is to ensure sufficient and restful sleep. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. Chronic fatigue typically happens after you’ve had no rest for some time and the body’s energy level cannot be restored after normal or increased periods of sleep. Coping with the impact of chronic stress can be challenging. Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning.",

According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

Both pilots should regularly update and share their mental models with each other to make sure that they are both \"on the same page\" with what is going on.

ERROR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Error Prevention aims at avoiding the error completely. Error Reduction aims at minimizing the likelihood that an error occurs and minimizing the extent of an error. Error Detection aims at making errors apparent as fast and as clearly as possible, thereby enabling recovery. Error Recovery aims at making it simple to rapidly recover the system to its safe state (after error occurrence). Error Tolerance aims at making the system better able to sustain itself despite error, i.e. providing a margin for error, to minimise failure consequences.",

There are three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. An hormone called adrenalin is released which your heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Resistance – During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to maintain the supply of energy to the muscles. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. Struggling with stress for long periods can drain your physical, emotional, and mental resources to the point where your body no longer has strength to fight stress. You may give up or feel your situation is hopeless. The stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol generate waste matter which must be eliminated.",

A good example of blinkered concentration would be watching the altimeter approach the preselected cruise altitude instead of scanning the basic T instruments, overlooking the possible deviation in airspeed. Another good example is the Eastern Airlines Flight 401 crash where the landing gear handle was placed in the \"down\" position during the preparation for landing, and the green light, which would have indicated to the flight crew that the nose landing gear was fully extended and locked, failed to illuminate. Whilst troubleshooting this problem, the crew missed the fact that one of them accidently pushed over the control column, starting a shallow descent towards the ground.

Synergy is considerably reduced and the risk of errors going undetected or unchallenged increases significantly. Conflict management is the process by which disputes are resolved, where negative results are minimized and positive results are prioritized. It involves the participation of all involved parties in finding an acceptable collective solution. Different strategies exist to discover misunderstandings, de-escalate a situation and restore appreciative relationship: Acknowledging that a difficult situation exists. Honesty and clear communication play an important role in the resolution process. Acquaint yourself with what's happening and be open about the problem. It is also important to have the desire to understand the different point of view of the other person. Active listening. Active listening is a way of listening and responding to another person that improves mutual understanding. This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the complete message being communicated. One can demonstrate that he/she is listening by smiling, nodding to show one has understood or saying “yes” or “mhh” to encourage him/her to continue. Arbitration. Should there be conflict in the cockpit, it is the clear duty of the Commander to arbitrate. Having made his/her decision, the reasons for coming to that decision should always be communicated to the crew.",

It is the body's way of reacting and adapting to challenging or threatening situations. Perception plays a very large role in the degree of stress suffered. Stress originates from individuals' evaluations of the perceived demands placed upon them and their perceived ability to cope with those demands. The person's evaluation of the imposed demands, rather than the actual demands themselves, shapes their assessment of the task's difficulty. Similarly, the perception of ability, rather than actual ability, determines the level of stress experienced. When you experience stress while performing a task but successfully complete it, the next time you will deal with the same task you are aware that you have the skills to achieve. The task will be evaluated as achievable and the individual will feel that the demand is within his/her capabilities, so stress experienced will be less and confidence will be higher.",

            "explanation": "Non-verbal communication refers to the transmission of messages or information through means other than spoken or written words. It encompasses various forms of cues and signals such as facial expressions, gestures, body language, posture, eye contact, tone of voice, and even physical proximity. Non-verbal communication can convey emotions, attitudes, intentions, and other subtle nuances that complement or contradict verbal messages. It plays a crucial role in interpersonal interactions, influencing how messages are perceived and understood by others. Let's analyze each statement about non-verbal communication: It allows you to better understand the other person you have never met before. This statement is correct. Non-verbal communication includes facial expressions, gestures, body language, eye contact, and other cues that provide insights into a person's emotions, attitudes, and intentions. When meeting someone for the first time, observing their non-verbal signals can help form initial impressions and understand their mood or receptiveness. Body language is inhibited in the cockpit, but non-verbal communication is helpful. Professional language allows for frictionless communication between two pilots who have never flown together before and may have different native languages. This is especially important for high workload environments. It must enable quick and effective communication and this can be achieved through quick comprehension and simplified grammar. Pilots do not rely on non-verbal communication to communicate effectively or execute their duties, but on the use of professional language. It allows you to determine the personality of the person who is using non-verbal communication. Non-verbal communication can provide clues about a person's current emotional state, level of engagement, or immediate intentions. However, determining someone's entire personality solely through non-verbal cues is challenging and can be unreliable. Personality is complex and influenced by many factors beyond observable behavior, including upbringing, beliefs, and experiences.",

These illusions do not only have an impact on a person’s mental picture and situational awareness. They also play a decisive role in the decision making process. The process of decision making is adversely affected by biases. Confirmation Bias is the term used to describe the tendency to search for information to confirm a theory, while overlooking contradicting information. Thus, even if presented with facts which would allow correcting the mental model, a pilot will probably find it difficult to get out of his original interpretation. It can be likened to making the ground fit the map, rather than accepting the fact that we are lost. You could also look upon it as a tendency to ignore information that confirms a decision is a poor one. Attentional bias: The tendency to prefer information connected to strong emotions, especially negative ones. Routine bias: The tendency to select the most familiar solution first, possibly at the expense of finding an even better one.",

When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information by various means, including speech. Officially, around 80% of all communication is achieved by factors other than words, otherwise known as metacommunication, which consists of those tools, other than the words, which complement them in order to communicate. The fact that somebody is not talking does not mean they are not communicating. It is said that 7% of communication is accomplished verbally, 38% by unconscious signals, such as tone of voice, and the remainder 55% by non-verbal means, such as body language. Non-verbal communication can accompany verbal communication, such as a smile during a face-to-face chat. Body language can be very subtle, but powerful – for example, the word “no” with a smile will be interpreted quite differently from one accompanied by a smack in the mouth. Non-verbal communication may also include written information or notes. Unfortunately, the side-by-side seating arrangements in the cockpit tend to lessen the effects of body language, so the choice of words (and their packaging) assumes a greater importance.",

However, if workload is reduced too much and the crew is left with nothing to do, it can easily happen that individual members become hypovigilant - which impairs situational awareness and crew communication. In order to minimise the risk of hypovigilance setting on, it is often recommended that computers should be regarded as additional crew members, implying that they are prone to error and require cross-check. It is paramount that the pilots create a mental picture of the current situation, think ahead and actively analyse what is going on, rathar than simply sit in their seat watching what the aircraft is doing (passive monitoring). One of the risks of automation is that pilots who are used to letting the aircraft fly itself are sometimes insufficiently trained in hand-flying, as they really practise their manual flying only in annual simulator check rides. Therefore, pilots should regularly disconnect automated system and practice hand-flying their aircraft to keep up their flying skills, which they might need when automation fails. In regular passenger flights, for example, an ILS approach does not necessarily need to be automatic until braking on the runway, pilots should be encouraged to disconnect the autopilot and perform the localiser and glide slope interceptions themselves.",

Autocratic Cockpit: An autocratic cockpit is described by the captain’s excessive authority, considerably reducing communication and consequently synergy and cohesion of the crew. Consists of a management style wherein the captain controls all the decisions and takes very little inputs from the co-pilot. Autocratic captains make choices or decisions based on their own beliefs and do not involve other crew members for their suggestion or advice. Rarely delegates tasks. By the very nature of the way the cockpit is run, the Captain is normally overloaded in the event of a problem. Laissez-faire Cockpit: A laissez-faire cockpit exists when a passive approach by the captain allows decisions, choices and actions to be made by other crew members, with a major risk of an inversion of authority. Encourages a relaxed and laid-back atmosphere in the cockpit with communications leaning towards non-professional subjects. Has a primary aim to please the rest of the crew. Self-centred Cockpit: A self-centred cockpit is one where crew members tend to do their own thing without telling the others what is going on. Synergistic Cockpit: Decisions are taken by the captain with the help and participation of the other crew members. Captain motivates the crew and develops the skills of the crew. Supports team working and clearly communicates intentions and required standards.",

According to the professor, different types of errors can be distinguished depending on the mode of operation and the awareness of deviation: Slips/Lapses. Slips do not satisfy the operator’s intent although the intent was correct. An example from aviation would be raising the flaps early on departure instead of the landing gear. When the intended correct action is not carried out at all or a certain step of the action is left out, this is referred to as lapse. An example would be missing an item from a checklist. In both cases, the errors are committed unintentionally. Mistakes. Also known as faults. The action satisfies the operator’s intent, but the intent itself was incorrect - the application of a rule that does not fit the situation. In contrast to slips and lapses, a person making a mistake does what he/she intends to do, but the action plan was inadequate to the situation. Violations. Sometimes appear to be human errors but they differ from slips and lapses in so far as they are deliberate “illegal” actions. This type of error is comitted deliberately while totally aware that a deviation from standards or rules will occur. An aviation example would be exceeding the maximum speed, which is clearly marked red on the airspeed indicator. Omissions. An omission is simply missing out a process or step that should be included. In very standard, often-practised tasks such as normal checklist reading, unexpected interruptions can frequently cause omissions to occur.",

Autocratic Cockpit: An autocratic cockpit is described by the captain’s excessive authority, considerably reducing communication and consequently synergy and cohesion of the crew. Consists of a management style wherein the captain controls all the decisions and takes very little inputs from the co-pilot. Autocratic captains make choices or decisions based on their own beliefs and do not involve other crew members for their suggestion or advice. Rarely delegates tasks. By the very nature of the way the cockpit is run, the Captain is normally overloaded in the event of a problem. Laissez-faire Cockpit: A laissez-faire cockpit exists when a passive approach by the captain allows decisions, choices and actions to be made by other crew members, with a major risk of an inversion of authority. Encourages a relaxed and laid-back atmosphere in the cockpit with communications leaning towards non-professional subjects. Has a primary aim to please the rest of the crew. Self-centred Cockpit: A self-centred cockpit is one where crew members tend to do their own thing without telling the others what is going on. Synergistic Cockpit: Decisions are taken by the captain with the help and participation of the other crew members. Captain motivates the crew and develops the skills of the crew. Supports team working and clearly communicates intentions and required standards.",

Particular emphasis must be placed on the importance of communications, as good communication skills can mean the difference between a successful and unsuccessful flight. In the actual environment of flying, several threats exist which can hamper or even prevent good communication. One of the biggest threats is high workload. Information overload has always been one of the biggest communication barriers. When several tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because also communication uses up mental resources. Distractions and interruptions can severely compromise flight safety if they occur during critical phases of flight. Interruptions and distractions may be brief, but they can be deadly. They can cause you to lose focus, which could lead to catastrophic errors. Interruptions and distractions break your train of thought, but sometimes they can also convey information that is critical for safe flight. The key is to learn how to safely manage the inflow of competing information.",

An autocratic cockpit is described by the captain’s excessive authority, considerably reducing communication and consequently synergy and cohesion of the crew. This kind of behaviour implies the danger that crew members disengage and their ideas and competence are lost for the team. \"2. excellent role-behaviour\" Correct. Role-behaviour is defined as the individual's behaviour that is determined by the role of the person, and the person's perception of how he or she should behave in particular environmental situations. Excellent role-behaviour translates into mature behaviour where the leader is able to make all crew members feel included and promote teamwork. A competent leader makes decisions based on the information feedback from all team members. Different ideas are welcome. \"3. mastery of communication skills\" Correct. One of the qualities of a skilled and competent leader is excellent communication skills. The purpose of having a crew is to reduce workload by enabling tasks to be shared. Efficient crew coordination will depend on effective communications and cooperation. \"4.\"Laissez-faire\" behaviour\" Incorrect. With laissez-faire style leadership, the captain is only minimally involved with coordination of his/her crew, basically letting them manage their work for themselves. It often leads to coaction instead of cooperation and is usually the least effective leadership style.

This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). It is important to understand the difference between active and passive monitoring: PASSIVE MONITORING is indirectly attending to stimuli by conditioned, involuntary, reflexive responses. Pilots simply sit in their seats whatching what the aircraft is doing instead of actively analyising what is going on. For example, driving your car while thinking about other things. Under these conditions, you will only be pulled back to the primary task when something alarming and/or distracting intervenes, such as lights, horns, emergency situations, etc. ACTIVE MONITORING, on the other hand, is consciously and selectively attending to a primary task, such as flying while listening to ATC, while checking your instruments and looking for trouble.",

Stress – Chronic stress, professional as well as domestic, can affect a pilot’s ability to focus. Alcohol – The physical effects of alcohol include incorrect judgement of distances and tunnel vision. Fatigue – Insufficient rest will lead to fatigue, either acute or chronic. Both will reduce a pilot’s vigilance and ability of judgement.

Human fallibility can be moderated but it can never be eliminated. A variety of factors can result in somebody making an error, including: Personality. A general readiness to accept higher risks as well as an overly cautious approach will increase the rate of errors. Motivation. Pilots who are unmotivated or under-aroused are more prone to errors. Emotional State. A pilot who feels depressed will be less attentive, which increases the possibility of losing situational awareness and making errors. The is true for someone who feels frustrated, angry, scared. Standardization brings quality and healthy environments to achieve the highest level of safety. Standard operating procedures alone does not contribute to human error - it should be a means of preventing.",

The SPEED autothrottle mode is selected on the Mode Control Panel. Just before the descent the left (number 1) radio altimeter reading drops to -8 ft, which automatically causes the autothrottle to close (RETARD). The right (number 2) radio altimeter reads 2000 ft. The pilots see the change in the autothrottle setting but, as the number 2 radio altimeter is still operating, they assume that it still controls the autothrottle and that the RETARD mode is normal for the descent. They do NOT adjust the settings on the Mode Control Panel. On intercepting the glide slope, the pilots assume the autothrottle will automatically enter the SPEED mode, and do NOT detect that the throttles actually remain closed until the loss of airspeed becomes critical.

Mode confusion occurs when the flight crew believes the automation is in a mode different than the one it is actually in and consequently make inappropriate requests or responses to the automation. It can be described as a kind of automation surprise, where the system does not behave according to the user’s expectations. In the case of mode confusion, the user loses track of which system is currently active or what kind of behaviour is appropriate for which mode. Mode confusion can also occur when the flight crew does not fully understand the behaviour of the automation in certain modes or how different modes interact, i.e., when the crew have a poor “mental model” of the automation. Mode confusion is what happened in this situation. The SPEED mode \"dropped out\" and the pilots were not aware, they now had an incorrect mental model of the automation, and were therefore incorrect in how they expected the aircraft to act. In a broader sense, it could also be classed as a lack of situational awareness. Also note that once the pilots have built a mental model, they will tend to seek only information that confirms our model (confirmation bias) and ignore other information that may cast doubt on its accuracy. Furthermore, people tend to give most weight to information received visually.",

Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

Autocratic Cockpit: An autocratic cockpit is described by the captain’s excessive authority (authoritarian style), considerably reducing communication and consequently synergy and cohesion of the crew. Consists of a management style wherein the captain controls all the decisions and takes very little inputs from the co-pilot. Autocratic captains make choices or decisions based on their own beliefs and do not involve other crew members for their suggestion or advice. Rarely delegates tasks. By the very nature of the way the cockpit is run, the Captain is normally overloaded in the event of a problem. Laissez-faire Cockpit: A laissez-faire cockpit exists when a passive approach by the captain allows decisions, choices and actions to be made by other crew members, with a major risk of an inversion of authority. Encourages a relaxed and laid-back atmosphere in the cockpit with communications leaning towards non-professional subjects. Has a primary aim to please the rest of the crew. Self-centred Cockpit: A self-centred cockpit is one where crew members tend to do their own thing without telling the others what is going on. Synergistic Cockpit: An effective flight deck (synergetic cockpit) exists when decisions are taken by the captain with the help and participation of other crew members. The captain motivates the crew and develops the skills of the crew. Supports team working and clearly communicates intentions and required standards.",

Human Error is considered inevitable and readback obligations for vital information have been installed to detect such errors and prevent them from having adverse consequences (mi-air collisions, etc).

Implicit is, “implied or understood though not plainly or directly expressed.” Something is, therefore, implicit when it is not directly stated but is either suggested in the wording or necessary to effectuate the purpose.

Flight ABC1 and XYZ1, GYC and GYE-all operating on the same frequency, at the same time and in the same airspace. Only one pilot listening on ATC frequency. \"Picking up the ATIS\" and \"talking to the company\" represented a time-critical gap in backup monitoring during two-pilot operations. Slips of mind and tongue. The typical human errors in this category included: Being advised of traffic at another flight level and accepting the information as clearance to that flight level; the classic \"one zero\" and \"one one thousand\" mix-up; the L/R confusion in parallel runways; the interpretation of \"maintain two five zero\" as an altitude rather than an airspeed limitation. Mind-set, pre-programmed for., and expectancy factors. The airmen tends to be spring-loaded to \"hear what we wanted to hear\" upon receipt of a blurred call sign transmission.",

The aircraft suffered a structural failure of a turbine blade of its No. 1 engine, causing vibrations, followed by a smell of smoke in the cockpit. Due to their experience with the previous version of the aircraft, the crew figured that the malfunctioning engine had to be No.2, as this had been the engine supplying cabin bleed air on their previous type. Consequently, No. 2 engine was shut down and thrust on No. 1 was increased. As this action stopped the vibrations, both pilots were convinced that they had acted correctly and planned their diversion to East Midlands Airport.\nMeanwhile, the damage to engine No.1 in combination with the high demands placed upon it caused a fire, which was noticed by the cabin crew and several passengers. The pilots, however, failed to detect the corresponding indications. On final approach, the thrust produced by engine No. 1 suddenly decreased to a level which was insufficient to carry the aircraft, which was fully configured for landing, over the bank of a road less than 900 metres in front of the runway.\nSelect the threat to aeronautical decision making which did NOT play a role in the accident:",

Both pilots failed to correctly identify the failed engine. This question is a good example of Environmental Capture. The pilots had experience on a different version of the aircraft, and they “transferred” their knowledge and skills to this similar environment. Due to the similarities of this new version of the aircraft, the pilots shutdown the wrong engine. Thereafter, power was increased on the “actually” malfunctioning engine. The vibrations ceased which in the pilots’ eyes was confirmation of their beliefs that they acted correctly and that there was something wrong with engine No. 2 (and not No.1). This is confirmation bias and describes their tendency to search for information to confirm their theory, while overlooking contradicting information (i.e. flight instruments). Groupthink is a phenomenon that occurs when a group of individuals reaches a consensus without critical reasoning or evaluation of the consequences or alternatives. Groupthink is based on a common desire not to upset the balance of a group of people. In many cases, people will set aside their own personal beliefs or adopt the opinion of the rest of the group. People who are opposed to the decisions or overriding opinion of the group as a whole frequently remain quiet, preferring to keep the peace rather than disrupt the uniformity of the crowd.

            "explanation": "Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are the documented processes that a company has in place to ensure that services and products are delivered consistently every time. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry regulation. They are incredibly important for standardisation and maintaining safety standards on every flight. They also allow pilots to work together very well, even with different backgrounds, language difficulties, or those who have never met before. To go through the options: \"The implementation of SOPs will ensure no violations ever occur.\" SOPs help to stop mistakes and omissions. They are still vulnerable to other errors, such as violations (deliberate acts against the rules), which SOPs do not change. \"SOPs have been thoroughly tested and always provide pilots with the quickest, easiest and safest way to complete every task.\" SOPs are tested and well thought through, but they are not always the fastest or easiest ways to accomplish a task or action. They are usually created to be safest, but not necessarily all three. \"SOPs generate a common framework of procedures for aircraft operations, which contribute to increased flight safety.\" This is correct. That is exactly what SOPs are, they bring commonality to an operator, so all their flights occur using the proper procedures. They also certainly improve flight safety over not using SOPs at all. \"Pilots can always know what behaviour to expect, even from completely new colleagues.\" This is incorrect. Completely new colleagues will take some time to adjust to the SOPs, so will not immediately behave precisely the way the SOPs dictate, particularly if they have come from a different operator using different SOPs.",

            "explanation": "The human body's response to stress is often referred to as the \"fight or flight\" reaction, which readies the body for defensive action or escape. This response involves various physiological changes initiated by the sympathetic nervous system, such as heightened breathing and heart rate, dilation of blood vessels in the muscles, and the release of energy stores. These changes can enhance physical strength, however they may also impair mental performance. In the specific scenario outlined in the question, the crew experiences a sudden and unexpected loud noise from one engine during a base turn. This event is subconsciously perceived as a potential threat or danger, prompting a fight or flight response as a natural response to the situation. Further information: GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME (GAS) The biological reaction to stress, which the organism is mobilized by is the General Adaptation Syndrome, where adaptation means the tendency of the body to fight to restore homeostasis against forces that upset the body’s natural balance. There are three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

Effective Communication Strategies for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Inquiry: Tactful questioning that clarifies issues and resolves misunderstandings. Open-ended questions are preferred as they encourage detailed explanations and a better understanding of the situation. Closed questions tend to provide limited information and may carry preconceptions. Advocacy: The act of actively supporting or encouraging a viewpoint. In aviation, advocacy is mainly used to back up another crew member's perspective during group decision-making. It serves to clarify or highlight a previously stated opinion. Metacommunication: This involves using non-verbal cues such as tone and body language to convey how verbal messages should be interpreted. These non-verbal elements play a crucial role in resolving conflicts, especially when expressing strong opinions. A message delivered with considerate and calm body language and tone can appear more sympathetic and understanding, even if the verbal content is assertive.",

            "explanation": "Automation can give the best of all worlds, if automation is complement to man. The cockpits have changed a lot; they carry lots of automation which modifies the crew behaviour during the flight. The crew behaviour will be adequately modified, if the pilots keep in mind that: The automation is a complement to man. The automation improves both flight safety and efficiency. The automation is tailored and adjusted for man. Man has to adapt to the existing automation through training. Different concepts exist as to the amount of control that is given to automated systems. Two major designers of transport category aircraft, Boeing and Airbus, can be found at opposing sides of the spectrum. Boeing approach to aircraft automation: the human pilot is considered to ultimately be irreplaceable. Systems are intended to relieve the pilots of as many tasks as possible in normal and abnormal flight. However, the pilot always remains the last operator and automation can always be overpowered by the pilots. Airbus approach to aircraft automation: ultimate control is given to their installed safety systems. Whatever input is made by the pilots through their fly-by-wire controls is first checked by a flight envelope protection system. Brief explanation about other options: \"Automation can reduce crew workload and protect from exceeding aircraft limitations, especially in an emergency or unexpected condition. For this reason automation concepts always ensure that the flight computers have ultimate control authority, to correct for pilot error.\" \"Flight computers have ultimate control authority\" is absolutely wrong. \"Automation is more reliable than humans but the crew are more capable than the automation of making decisions and performing in unexpected situations and emergencies.\" Therefore, central to all automation concepts is that the pilot is the last operator. There is a different automation concept, which is to correct pilot. \"In a fly-by-wire aircraft, computer-controlled flight modes are used to control surface movements and prevent the aircraft from exceeding operational limits; in such aircraft, the pilot has full control authority and therefore is the last operator.\" Fly by wire system is to correct pilot. Pilot is not the last operator in this system.",

Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information by various means, including speech. Officially, around 80% of all communication is achieved by factors other than words, otherwise known as metacommunication, which consists of those tools, other than the words, which complement them in order to communicate. The fact that somebody is not talking does not mean they are not communicating. It is said that 7% of communication is accomplished verbally, 38% by unconscious signals, such as tone of voice, and the remainder 55% by non-verbal means, such as body language. Non-verbal communication can accompany verbal communication, such as a smile during a face-to-face chat. Body language can be very subtle, but powerful – for example, the word “no” with a smile will be interpreted quite differently from one accompanied by a smack in the mouth. Non-verbal communication may also include written information or notes. Unfortunately, the side-by-side seating arrangements in the cockpit tend to lessen the effects of body language, so the choice of words (and their packaging) assumes a greater importance.",

Social language (everyday communication) leaves room for alternative interpretations and, therefore, there is often room for misunderstandings. This can cause interruptions during an emergency situation, as mentioned in this question. Any need for clarification will only delay the procedures required to deal with the emergency. In order to overcome the disadvantages of everyday language, professionals in any field use technical languages which are much less subject to ambiguity and are more economical when communicating amongst themselves. This so-called professional language should be mastered by all professionals in order to allow mutual understanding and safe operations. Professional language allows for frictionless communication between two pilots who have never flown together before and may have different native languages. This is especially important for high workload environments. It must enable quick and effective communication and this can be achieved through quick comprehension and simplified grammar.

In contrast to travelling by car, it is not possible to simply stop at the side of an airway while flying and analyse the situation. Every good decision-making process must take this into consideration. To improve the quality of decision, if the time is not the immediate limiting factor, a pilot should take all the available time that he needs to make up his mind and should try not to feel pressured to speed up the decision-making process unnecessarily by his crewmembers. Rushed decision should be avoided, as these will increase the risk of overlooking important facts and losing situational awareness. It is important to emphasise that, during flight, the overall situation is constantly evolving and changing. Therefore, decisions only remain valid for a limited period of time - until the next change in the overall situation occurs. Thereafter, a new decision is needed.",

Sensory stimulation is the first stage in the information process, and the basis of perception is the intensity of the stimulus.

What each individual perceives results from interplays between past experiences and the interpretation of the perceived. It is important to note that perception is highly resistant to correction and can be persuasive. Once you are convinced that you have found the correct interpretation for your perceptions, your brain tends to adjust your new perceptions to your mental picture of the situation. American Airlines Flight in 1997: The aircraft was in a holding pattern. The airborne weather radar showed heavy precipitation in the vicinity of the holding point. Busy assessing the weather ahead, the crew did not notice that they had accidently pulled back the throttle levers (below the auto throttle minimum), causing the auto throttle to disengage. The airspeed decreased and, once again, the crew failed to notice this indication. Upon experiencing aerodynamic stall buffet, the crew interpreted it as turbulence. As the aircraft stalled, the crew assumed they were facing wind shear and performed the wind shear escape manoeuvre. They were able to recover and land safely. They were only made aware that the aircraft had stalled by the NTSB inspectors.",

There are three main ways of coping with stress; action coping (removing or reducing the stressor), cognitive coping (reducing how badly we perceive the stressor) and symptom-directed coping (addressing the symptoms of stress only, not the stressor itself). All the above stress coping techniques require the individual to identify the stress and its symptoms. Recognising stress can be difficult because it often sneaks up on us. Although there are many symptoms of stress, how it manifests is individual. It is important to note that stress is cumulative. Cumulative stress is the sum of the total amount of stressors including their severity and how long they persist for.

To be effective, SOPs must be clear, concise and free of conflict. Use of SOP’s is a form of Rule-based behaviour (and skill-based) and is less error prone than Knowledge-based behaviour. One of the advantages of SOP is that actions are always completed in the same sequence, reducing the probability of missing a step (slips and lapses). However, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of errors. SOP must achieve the task at hand and provide a step-by-step guideline on how to complete it.

They are, however a point of potential nervousness for the pilot, as they might not have had their skills examined for 6 months, and may be feeling like they are sub-standard, or not well prepared for the simulator flight, which is an assessment. There will be events involved that are not practiced in normal flight, and use of checklists that the pilot might not have seen for a while, or properly studied recently. The added stress/anxiety of an assessed simulator flight can cause a reduction in performance during the flight itself, as unsatisfactory performance could (eventually) lead to a potential dismissal. Of course, there is a long line of events that occur before dismissal, but a pilot that is already stressed might focus on the threat of losing their job, causing them even more stress, and reduced performance. To address the other possible answers; It is very common not to know the examiner, however, this should not be a factor in the pilot's performance during the session. Hypovigilance is the opposite of what is occurring here. The pilot is stressed due to hypervigilance rather than hypovigilance, and the routine simulator session would usually be very eventful. An engine failure scenario is (hopefully) not practised during line flying, but the procedures for dealing with one are very well learnt in training, and practiced every 6 or 12 months in the simulator. This could contribute to stress, but not likely as much as the potential of losing one's job. Note: There has been conflicting feedback about the answer to this question. Any further exam feedback can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you!",

This was an \"omission error\" where the pilots forgot to perform a necessary action, namely checking the fuel. The pilots correctly executed the actions they did take, but they missed certain steps, such as checking the fuel, which might have been a memorized task or part of the normal descent checklist. A failure in the fuel warning system is not confirmed, and in any case the crew is responsible for monitoring fuel quantity, especially when entering a holding pattern. The pilots became excessively fixated on the emergency situation, leading to a loss of situational awareness and distraction. Flight training addresses this issue, but it's a common human error that needs to be overcome. Tools like TDODAR, the decision-making process, include a consideration of time, which is constrained by the remaining fuel and should have factored into the flight crew's decision-making.",

The two types of fatigue are acute and chronic: Acute fatigue – short-term, more intense which usually affects the body, and just needs a good nights’ sleep to sort things out. Acute stress activates the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), where physical, emotional and mental resources are mobilized to fight stress. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. Chronic fatigue typically happens after you’ve had no rest for some time and the body’s energy level cannot be restored after normal or increased periods of sleep. Coping with the impact of chronic stress can be challenging. Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning.

Latent errors have consequences that lie dormant and are difficult to recognize or foresee because of the time lag between their generation and occurrence, while active errors, which are committed at the human/system interface, have consequences that are felt almost immediately, which is how they can be detected. Active errors are committed by the “sharp end”, those people who are directly involved in flight operations (pilots, ATC, etc). Latent errors are usually committed by the blunt-end, people who are not directly engaged in flight operations. However, latent errors can also be made by front-line personnel. An example of a latent error committed by a pilot would be the selection of a wrong waypoint in a GPS database. Latent errors sometimes require the occurrence of an inevitable active error to have consequences at all, lulling the pilots in security.",

Ahead of time, the commander took advantage of the available data and made deviation scenarios to be able to anticipate emergency deviations and act without delay. This is an example of good pre-planning and anticipation. 2. After experiencing an emergency, the pilots asks the ATC for assistance in choosing an alternate aerodrome. It is the commander’s responsibility to study alternate aerodromes during pre-flight preparation, and have knowledge of the anticipated weather and characteristics of these aerodromes. Due to poor pre-flight preparation and lack of anticipation of a need to deviate, the commander is unable to handle the situation and asks the help of the ATC. 3. On a cruise flight over water, the aircraft suffers an emergency which requires one engine to be shut down. The pilot quickly decides whether to continue the flight or divert to and nearest suitable aerodrome. It is the commander’s responsibility to be able to handle emergency situations, be familiar with the emergency checklist and prepared to act in case of an emergency.

Vigilance is greatly affected by our level of alertness, and this is why we can be affected not only by being overloaded but also by being ‘under-loaded’. Hypovigilance is a state that which vigilance is reduced and the crew become more prone to errors. This can be also described as a microsleep since it has similar characteristics. Hypovigilance can occur during periods of: Monotony, reduction of workload, during simple or repetitive tasks, constant and monotonous noise, low lighting, high temperature, isolation, sleep debit, fatigue. It can also occur shortly after a meal. From the available options, looking to instruments without reading during the cruise is a very good example of hypovigilance.",

In contrast to travelling by car, it is not possible to simply stop at the side of an airway while flying and analyse the situation. Every good decision-making process must take this into consideration. To improve the quality of decision, if the time is not the immediate limiting factor, a pilot should take all the available time that he needs to make up his mind and should try not to feel pressured to speed up the decision-making process unnecessarily by his crewmembers. Rushed decision should be avoided, as these will increase the risk of overlooking important facts and losing situational awareness. It is important to emphasise that, during flight, the overall situation is constantly evolving and changing.

Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lightning, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision.",

The relationship between workload and performance is a symmetrical inverted U (performance being on the vertical axis and workload on the horizontal axis). Increases in workload will result in the increase of performance, up to a point, called the break point, beyond which further workload is dysfunctional to the outcome of performance and will dramatically narrow the span of attention. This question depicts a situation where the pilot is perhaps overconfident and familiarity breeds contempt. Placing him on the left side of the performance vs pressure/workload curve. We’ve all experienced the negatives and positives of pressure. Too much and you feel you can’t cope. Not enough, and you struggle to get anything done. Not only do we not perform well with insufficient pressure, the resultant tedium can also be very stressful.",

An ergonomic source of error is, for example, cockpit noise and the restriction of the field of view due to windscreen design. Ideally, the principle of design ensures that the job required should be fitted to the man rather than the man to the job – this is not always the case. Economics.

This technique is also utilized in the French telephone directory, where numbers are presented in separated blocks, allowing individuals to remember them in chunks of three figures. Association: Association is a technique commonly employed to remember spoken lists of items. It involves creating wild and unusual associations and linking them to each item on the list. Many people, including politicians, utilize this method to help connect names with faces and enhance recall. Mnemonics: Mnemonics is an effective tool for remembering multiple points by creating a word, phrase, or sentence that represents the information. This technique involves using memorable associations or patterns to aid memory recall. Acronyms like \"HASELL\" or \"FREDA\" can aid in memory recall by providing a structured and memorable way to associate and organize information. By employing these techniques, individuals can improve their short-term memory retention and retrieval capabilities. In the example \"I'M SAFE\" (Illness, Medication, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, Eating) the mnemonic techique is used. A word is created and each letter represents an item that needs to be memorised.",

This was an \"error of omission\", where the pilots forgot to do something that they needed to do, which was to check the fuel. The pilots correctly conducted the actions that they made (as far as we know), they just missed actions like checking the fuel, which will likely have been a memory item. The pilots became overly focussed on the emergency and lost situational awareness, and became distracted. This is taught in flight school, but is a natural error of the human condition that we must learn to overcome. Tools such as TDODAR, the decision making process, include reference to \"time\", which is absolutely limited by fuel remaining, and should have been a consideration to this flight crew. To address the other options, the crew would not \"rely\" on a low fuel indication, and so it is irrelevant whether it was serviceable or not. This scenario is, unfortunately, very easy to do, as distraction and \"tunnel vision\" on a task is something our brains do very regularly, that we have to fight.",

Fatigue is a major human factors hazard because it affects most aspects of a crewmember’s ability to do their job. It therefore has implications for safety. ICAO defines a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as: A data-driven means of continuously monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety risks, based upon scientific principles and knowledge as well as operational experience that aims to ensure relevant personnel are performing at adequate levels of alertness. An FRMS aims to ensure that flight and cabin crew members are sufficiently alert so they can operate to a satisfactory level of performance. It is a set of guidelines aimed at reducing fatigue-induced safety risks and considers additional factors such as the circadian rhythm, the importance of adequate sleep within the rest period, and the unique properties of the individual operation. FRMS is based on computer models which anticipate the expected performance capability of a person from his/her sleep/awake history. Such models must be continuously updated by analyses of data and reports. The quality of the FRMS depends on its ability to learn. The term used for this kind of safety culture is “learning culture”. It is also dependent on the willingness of aircrew to report fatigue-related issues and in a culture where crew members are encouraged to report safety risks. However, such safety cultured is named “just culture” and not “non-punitive culture”.",

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that acute stress may also have detrimental effects on situational awareness and performance. Individuals under acute stress may exhibit tunnel vision (fixation), wherein the five senses, except for a limited visual field in each eye, become filtered out. Loud noises and pain may go unnoticed during this narrowed focus. It's noteworthy that stress, both in its causes and manifestations, is subjective and varies significantly among individuals. In line with EASA expectations based on student feedback, it's emphasized that auditory information is often discarded first under acute stress.

When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information by various means, including speech. Officially, around 80% of all communication is achieved by factors other than words, otherwise known as metacommunication, which consists of those tools, other than the words, which complement them in order to communicate. The fact that somebody is not talking does not mean they are not communicating. It is said that 7% of communication is accomplished verbally, 38% by unconscious signals, such as tone of voice, and the remainder 55% by non-verbal means, such as body language. Non-verbal communication can accompany verbal communication, such as a smile during a face-to-face chat. Body language can be very subtle, but powerful – for example, the word “no” with a smile will be interpreted quite differently from one accompanied by a smack in the mouth. Non-verbal communication may also include written information or notes. Unfortunately, the side-by-side seating arrangements in the cockpit tend to lessen the effects of body language, so the choice of words (and their packaging) assumes a greater importance.",

Synergy is considerably reduced and the risk of errors going undetected or unchallenged increases significantly. Conflict management is the process by which disputes are resolved, where negative results are minimized and positive results are prioritized. It involves the participation of all involved parties in finding an acceptable collective solution. Different strategies exist to discover misunderstandings, de-escalate a situation and restore appreciative relationship: Active listening. Active listening is a way of listening and responding to another person that improves mutual understanding. This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the complete message being communicated. One can demonstrate that he/she is listening by smiling, nodding to show one has understood or saying “yes” or “mhh” to encourage him/her to continue. Metacommunication. Metacommunication literally means \"communication about communication\", and it refers to all the nonverbal cues (tone of voice, body language, gestures, facial expression, etc.) that carry meaning that either enhance or disallow what we say in words. Tonal presentation or body language can go a long way to help defuse conflict. If a forceful point of view must be made, it may become more acceptable if it is accompanied with tactful or non-aggressive body language/tone of voice.",

Maintaining a respectful and collaborative atmosphere through effective crew resource management is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure safe and efficient flight operations.",

Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lightning, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision.",

They are usually right.

Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible.

According to the professor, different types of errors can be distinguished depending on the mode of operation and the awareness of deviation: Slips/Lapses. Slips do not satisfy the operator’s intent although the intent was correct. An example from aviation would be raising the flaps early on departure instead of the landing gear. When the intended correct action is not carried out at all or a certain step of the action is left out, this is referred to as lapse. An example would be missing an item from a checklist. In both cases, the errors are committed unintentionally. Mistakes. Also known as faults. The action satisfies the operator’s intent, but the intent itself was incorrect - the application of a rule that does not fit the situation. In contrast to slips and lapses, a person making a mistake does what he/she intends to do, but the action plan was inadequate to the situation. Violations. Sometimes appear to be human errors but they differ from slips and lapses in so far as they are deliberate “illegal” actions. This type of error is comitted deliberately while totally aware that a deviation from standards or rules will occur. An aviation example would be exceeding the maximum speed, which is clearly marked red on the airspeed indicator.",

Confirmation Bias: Decision-makers might have a tendency to favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs or initial plan. This bias can lead them to overlook or dismiss contradictory information, which can result in flawed decision-making. They may actively seek out data that aligns with their initial plan while neglecting critical evidence that suggests alternative courses of action. This can lead to a failure to adapt to changing circumstances. Decision-makers who are overly confident in their initial plan or mental picture may not adequately consider potential risks or alternative options. This can lead to underestimating challenges and overestimating the chances of success, resulting in poor decisions. Decision-makers may fail to update their mental picture or adjust their plan when new, relevant information becomes available. This inflexibility can lead to missed opportunities. Focusing excessively on the initial plan or mental picture may cause decision-makers to overlook other crucial aspects of the situation. They may become so fixated on their preconceived ideas that they miss out on valuable insights, creative solutions, or warning signs that could influence their decision. Group effects do not always affect negative the decision making process.",

Motor programmes enables an individual to perform more than one task at the same time by freeing mental resources – this way, one task can be performed requiring conscious attention, while performing another one at an unconscious level (motor programme). According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

In a multi-crew environment, operators usually define who will be responsible for radio communicadtions, that is usually the pilot monitoring. However, both pilots shall react independently and simultaneously to an ATC instruction. Both pilots have defined actions to do on receipt of a clearance and there is a cross check built into the process. The reason for independent simultaneous action is to ensure that both pilots have heard the instruction, have actioned the instruction and the crosscheck will identify any error by an individual pilot. If the response is not independent and simultaneous one pilot tends to follow the other and there is no opportunity to capture an error if one is made at this point. In this case, the question states that both pilots are tuned to the ground frequency, therefore both should be monitoring the radio - therefore, both have committed the error.",

Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue.

Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lighting, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation with other crew members and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision. The SOPs have been written, authorised and amended for such long-haul flights with many physiological factors taken into account, and will make sure that the flight is completed to the correct safety standards, without faults or omissions, so they should always be followed. As for the other options, you should not \"Experiment with the auto-flight system\", as this gives the potential to induce an error which puts the current flight at risk. You should also not fly the aircraft manually, as this will likely be against SOPs (and against the law when inside RVSM airspace), and no-offence, but the autopilot is much more reliable to fly accurately in the cruise than a human pilot.",

            "explanation": "AUTOMATION Cockpit automation has the potential to increase or decrease the flight safety, depending on how well you use the equipment. Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

There are three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

Rushed decision should be avoided, as these will increase the risk of overlooking important facts and losing situational awareness.

There are three stages: Alarm, Resistance, and Exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

Acute stress activates the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), where physical, emotional and mental resources are mobilized to fight stress. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. Chronic fatigue typically happens after you’ve had no rest for some time and the body’s energy level cannot be restored after normal or increased periods of sleep. Coping with the impact of chronic stress can be challenging. Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning.",

The development of procedures makes pilots more effective and reliable in their activities - a process called - procedural consistency. Pilots are instructed about the company’s SOPs in operational skill trainings. In anual checks, their knowledge and compliance with the current SOPs is checked. SOP can develop over time.

While all the crew members were occupied with the landing gear indicator, one of the pilots inadvertently knocked a control wheel, bringing the aircraft into a gradual descent, which went unnoticed. The air traffic controller discovered that the aircraft had descended to 900 ft and asked if there was any trouble, but did not mention the altitude loss directly. The crew confirmed that everything was alright. Only seconds before the crash, the first officer realised that they were descending into the swampland, but the crash could no longer be prevented at the stage.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been defined after much research in order to ensure the most successful outcome from all reasonably likely circumstances. They are not discretionary and must be followed precisely. Failure to follow established procedures has been found to be a causal factor in many aircraft accidents and serious incidents. Strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) can eliminate or at least mitigate the adverse effects of various operational factors and human errors that can lead to incidents and accidents.

Learning Objective 040.03.05.01.04: State that with behaviour good and bad habits can be formed. Behaviour is generally a product of personality, attitude and the environment to which one was exposed at significant moments (childhood, schooling and training). Behaviour may be voluntary or involuntary. A habit is a recurrent and often unconscious pattern of behaviour that is acquired through frequent repetition. While consciously executed at first, the behaviour becomes more and more automated with time, it is performed without thinking about it and without any specific reason that could be named when asked. In simple words, habits form when new behaviours become automatic and are enacted with minimum conscious awareness. To go through each option then: \"One can change their behaviour to change their habits.\" Correct. Changing one's behaviour enough will make it become more automatic, and turn it into a habit. \"Personality is a product of someone's good and bad habits.\" Personality is far more complex than someone's habits, it is formed from their genetics and their environment up to that point in life. \"Habits and behaviour are unrelated.\" They are very much related, habits are formed from automatic behaviours. (this option was added by us as it was not fed back) \"Behaviour always changes with habits.\" No, changing behaviour changes habits, it is the other way around.

            "explanation": "The Parent-Adult-Child Mode This question refers to the Parent-Ault-Child (PAC) mode which was developed by Eric Berne. Berne developed the idea that people can switch between different states of mind - sometimes in the same conversation and certainly in different parts of their lives, for example at work and at home. He found that these states of mind aggregated into three types which he christened Parent, Adult and Child. It is important to note that these terms have a slightly different meaning within theoretical context than they do in normal, day to day language: Parent. Their response unconsciously mimics how their parents or parental figures acted. The focus is on rules, judgements, decisions, counsel, care and punishment. It has two functions. One is to enable people to be better actual parents of their children. The other is to enable many responses to life to be made automatically - \"that's the way it's done\" - thereby freeing the Adult from making innumerable trivial decisions. Adult. This state is where we hope to be as adults. Responses are direct responses to the here and now. There's reliance on information sensory, perceptions and facts. They are reasonable, logical and rational, neither threatened or threatening. It also has the function of regulating the activities of the Parent and Child, and mediating between them. Child. This state consists of parts of ourselves which hark back to our childhood. It is childlike but not childish. in this state \"reside intuition, creative and spontaneous drive and enjoyment\". => The ideal way of communication and coordination between flight crew (and cabin crew) is a mature adult-adult relationship, for most situations. Obviously, other relationships may develop. For example, Parent-Child - in such case, care should be taken to ensure that the \"Parent\" acts as a Nurturing parent, in order to allow the \"child\" to gain trust and feel free to voice different opinions.",

AUTOFLIGHT SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS Inability to predict future events: This is a fundamental restriction of autoflight systems, however it is not included in the LOs, therefore we believe EASA excludes it from the correct answer. Autoflight systems rely on programmed algorithms and sensor data to operate. They can make predictions based on available data and predefined parameters, but these predictions are typically limited to well-defined and predictable aspects of a flight. They cannot foresee unexpected or complex scenarios, such as sudden changes in weather or other unanticipated events. Lack of creativity in unknown situations: This is another limitation of autoflight systems. These systems operate within the boundaries of their programming and do not possess the creativity or adaptability that human pilots have in dealing with novel or unforeseen situations. Human pilots can use their judgment and experience to handle unexpected events, while autoflight systems follow predefined procedures and may not be equipped to deal with entirely unforeseen circumstances. Absence of personal motivation with regard to flight safety: Autoflight systems lack personal motivation. While they are programmed to prioritize flight safety and follow established safety protocols, they do not have the personal motivation, emotions, or instincts that humans have. Human pilots are driven by a strong personal commitment to safety, which can lead to decisions that go beyond the strict boundaries of predefined procedures. Ability to provide guidance on system failures: Autoflight systems are typically equipped with diagnostic and fault detection mechanisms. When system failures or anomalies are detected, these systems can provide guidance to pilots or take specific actions to mitigate the effects of the failure.",

SOPs provide a shared reference framework for all crew members and promote crew synergy. \"Undesired aircraft states leading to threats can be prevented by consequently applying automation as directed per SOP.\" Incorrect. The use of autopilot/autothrust increases passenger comfort, however it does not automatically prevent undesired aircraft states. \"Pilots not applying SOP can immediately be reported and excluded from flying duties to increase flight safety.\" Incorrect.

Physiological Stressors – fatigue, lack of physical fitness, improper eating habits, hunger, thirst, cold/too hot, humidity, dehydration. Psychological/emotional stress – inter-personal conflicts, discrimination, fear of failure, death of a relative, divorce, financial problems, job insecurity. Domestic stressors come in a wide variety and include: Social stressors (marriage, pregnancy or death), Economic stressors (bank loans, partner's loss of job, children's Christmas wishes, etc) and Environmental stressors (defective air conditioning or contruction sites close-by).

It encompasses various modes of communication, such as verbal, written, visual, or non-verbal means, depending on the context and medium used. The message is encoded by the sender and decoded by the receiver, enabling the transfer of meaning. Good communication is characterized by effectiveness, which means that the message is accurately and clearly transmitted, received, and understood by the intended recipient(s). It involves the skillful use of language, appropriate choice of communication channels, and consideration of the receiver's background, culture, and context.

Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lighting, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision.",

VFR Pilots may attempt to continue a VFR flight in IMC conditions for many reasons, such as: Placing priority on the wrong things (e.g. loss of time or additional expense of a diversion or delay to the flight) when making decisions. Poor situational awareness perhaps as a result of pilots’ lack of experience in interpreting changing weather conditions once airborne. Over-confidence leading to poor risk awareness because pilots overestimate their own abilities and are compacent about flying into adverse weather. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

Procedural Memory: stores information about motor skills e.g. interaction of muscles and balance involved in riding a bicycle. Episodic Memory: stores information about past events which can be affected by suggestion e.g. last year’s holidays (can be unreliable). Amnesia usually affects only episodic memory. Semantic Memory: stores general knowledge e.g. the meaning of words, grammar rules etc. It tends to be accurate and long lasting. Repetition (or rehearsing) is used to get information into it, combined with organising it, placing it into some sort of context or associating it with an emotion. The main limitation of the long-term memory is that information retrieval can be difficult. Therefore, knowledge stored in long-term memory should be pre-activated (with planning and anticipation) so it can be available when required and have the access time reduced.

Automation can conserve resources and attention, relieving pilot workload and giving time for supervision. However, if given too much control, the cockpit becomes boring, and errors can go unnoticed amongst the monotony. Pilots can also become less confident in their basic airmanship and flying skills. Whereas machines can wait for infrequent information without getting bored, can perform long-term control and set values, again, without getting bored; people can exercise judgement, make better decisions, and detect unusual conditions (smells, noises), while getting easily bored. So, on the one hand, automation is good, because it can take a lot of routine work away from you. On the other hand, automation can induce a feeling of automation complacency – too much reliance on the machine, and lead you not to check things as often as you should. A high degree of automation may alter traditional tasks so much that your attention and competence is reduced once you are out of the loop. Thus, communication and coordination call for a greater effort from the crew. You can avoid automation complacency by regarding systems as one more crewmember that needs to be cross-checked – that is, you have to make sure that the autopilot is actually taking you in the right direction. You can cope with low error tolerant situations by constantly complying with cross-over verification procedures.",

Self-discipline is the ability to control one's feelings and overcome one's weaknesses. It is a very important quality for a pilot to have, and is important for flight safety in many different ways, from upholding the correct procedures, to staying focussed and ahead of the aircraft during a flight. Let's now go through each option: \"Strictly following the principle of “read and do” when performing checklists to improve crew coordination.\" This is not always the case. \"Read and do\" checklists have their place in a cockpit, but many checklists, particularly in multi-crew aircraft are of the \"challenge and response\" type. \"Strictly following all standard operating procedures in order to avoid omissions and mistakes.\" This is correct. The SOPs are to be followed at all times, even when some pilots might think that they are unnecessary, or overkill. They are there for a reason, and a disciplined pilot will always follow them when they are to be used. As this question mentions, they make sure everything is done correctly, standardised between crew, and help to greatly reduce mistakes and omissions. \"Complying with manufacturer recommendations with regards to power settings to preserve engine life.\" Whilst this is the right thing to do, it is not nearly as good of an example of self-discipline as the above option. There isn't really any reason to not comply with these instructions. Also, they are recommendations to preserve engine life, so do not really affect flight safety much, moreso the financial cost. Therefore, this is incorrect. \"Adopting the principle of “sterile cockpit” in all phases of flight.\" No. Whilst the sterile cockpit principle is very important during critical phases of flight, it would be silly and dangerous to uphold it in non-critical phases of flight such as the cruise. It is better for the pilots to be able to talk about things other than the aircraft, especially for longer flights, where hypovigilance could be a risk.",

            "explanation": "Immediately after waking up, you may experience sleep inertia, which is a temporary period of reduced cognitive performance and alertness. Your brain takes some time to transition from a sleep state to being fully awake and functioning optimally. During this transition, you may experience grogginess, slower reaction times, decreased attention, and impaired decision-making abilities. Sleep inertia is associated with reduced brain activity in regions responsible for alertness, attention, and cognitive processing, as well as decreased connectivity between brain networks. Sleep inertia is believed to arise from the residual effects of sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. During SWS, brain activity is characterized by synchronized, slow-frequency delta waves. When abruptly awakened from deep sleep, the brain experiences a state of transitional instability as it shifts to a wakeful state. This transition disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, leading to sleep inertia. When body temperature is rising, performance is likely to increase. Performing complex tasks and working during high workload can also affect performance, but they are not universally associated with low performance in the same way that sleep inertia immediately after waking up is. While complex tasks and high workload can lead to decreased performance, they are situational factors that can vary depending on an individual's preparedness, experience, and other factors. In contrast, sleep inertia is a more consistent and predictable phenomenon after waking up.",

Learning Objective 040.03.01.03.09: Explain that skills are kept primarily in the long-term memory. A skill is defined as the ability to do an activity or job well, especially because of practise. With practise, a skill becomes increasingly automated, requiring less attention and may be executed faster. However, if not used for long periods of time, a period of retraining may be required to retrieval a previous acquired skill. Skills are stored in the long term memory, in a section known as the procedural memory. As for the other options: Long term memory does not get \"overwritten\" as it is essential unlimited in size (as far as humans can use it). 6 months is a made up length of time based on the time between commercial OPCs, skills last longer than this, but retraining helps to keep them useable if necessary. There is no such \"extra level\" of memory which is unlimited, where skills are stored. They are stored in the procedural section of the long term memory.",

Simply put; pilots cannot fly safely without being situationally aware. Being situationally aware makes you a better anticipator. They work hand in hand. It is not an easy task. You can teach a certain degree of anticipation, but it is normally mastered with experience. Let's use cross-country flying as an example. During flight planning, the pilot should anticipate factors that may affect the flight. Will hot temperatures create thermals that may cause uncommanded changes in attitude or altitude? Will the combination of temperature and humidity lead to reduced visibility, making checkpoints harder to spot? Will hot temperatures affect aircraft performance? And how will that affect the amount of load that can be loaded into the aircraft? In this case, the pilot correctly prepared for his/her flight by performing performance calculations and taking into account the effects of increased temperature on performance.",

This is an intrapersonal conflict, as they have conflicting thoughts as to what to do. The Captain is not part of this conflict. The second scenario is more on the edge. Feedback shows that the examiner wants the answer of interpersonal.

Optimum performance is achieved when all team members are used in their area of expertise, so the crew can perform several tasks simultaneously. This results in reduced stress among crew members. Group decisions. The option to draw knowledge from different group members allows the realisation of complex objectives. Combined knowledge leads to more informed and better decisions. While decision making is also important for single-pilots, working in a multi-crew cockpit provides additional options as well as risks, both of which should be known to multi-crew pilots in order to obtain optimum results and increase flight safety. On the other hand, conformity concerns the likelihood of an individual to go along with a group decision, even if it is an inappropriate decision. This poses the threat for the group to lose valuable input, as it becomes difficult to voice an alternate opinion. Risky shift means that a group tends to make riskier decisions than any group member alone would have made. The most probably reason for this is that in a group, people subconsciously feel that they do not need to take the blame for failure alone, while at the same time they receive their good share of praise in case of success. It is one of the commonly mentioned drawbacks of teamwork.",

There are three main levels of memory within the \"multi-store\" memory model; the sensory store (very short), the working memory (short-term) and the long-term memory. The capacity of the working memory is limited to 5 +/- 2 items (7 +/- 2 according to the old syllabus), which can be stored for an average period of 15 to 20 seconds. Some information can last in short-term memory for up to a minute if rehearsal strategies are used. The information in short-term memory is also highly susceptible to interference. Any new information that enters short-term memory will quickly displace old information. Similar items in the environment can also interfere with short-term memories. A process called chunking (creating information chunks, made up of individual items) can increase the amount that can be stored in the working memory, but does take some thought. The working memory therefore only is required for one of these options, and that is the new squawk code that has been passed to the pilot. This is new information that is required to be remembered for a few seconds only. Once it is inputted into the transponder and checked, it does not matter if it is forgotten, as the transponder has it stored now. The emergency and radio failure squawk codes (7700 and 7600 respectively) should be held in the long-term memory by pilots, and are therefore easy to recall when required. They are not held in the working memory.",

Mnemonics are very useful memory techniques, for increasing the efficiency, capacity and recall of certain parts of the memory. They are useful for giving meaning to things, and can help in remembering both knowledge and skills (how to perform a task). The long term memory is split up into 3 parts, semantic memory, procedural memory and episodic memory. The semantic memory contains knowledge, so would be assisted by the use of mnemonics. Procedural memory is that of skills, so would also be assisted by the use of mnemonics. Episodic memory, however, is the memory of events, and cannot be aided by memory techniques, so mnemonics will not help this. This also means that mnemonics will not assist all types of long term memory (as episodic is missed out). Working memory is short term memory, so sentence mnemonics are not very useful, due to the time constraints involved. There are other, less used mnemonic devices that could possibly help the working memory, such as visualisation, but it is debatable whether these help the working memory or allow things to be more easily committed to the long term memory. Nonetheless, this is EASA, and the examiner has chosen \"working memory\" as the correct answer. The best way to increase the size of the working memory is usually via a method called chunking, where individual bits of data become just one piece of data, such as in words, or familiar numbers.",

            "explanation": "This question presents a notable challenge, initially seeming to have two plausible answers. Let's break down each of these options: \"The pilots are in a state of vigilance which requires a certain level of arousal to be effective.\" This statement is indeed correct, and there's no way to argue otherwise. Vigilance involves being attentive and watchful over an extended period to detect and respond to unexpected events. In this context, arousal pertains to the level of wakefulness and alertness necessary for a person during vigilance tasks. Arousal is a component of vigilance. In summary, during the cruise phase, pilots must maintain vigilance and a specific level of alertness to properly monitor instruments and react to any alterations or anomalies. \"The pilots should divide attention to scan instruments individually.\" To begin, it's essential to distinguish between divided attention and selective attention. Selective Attention: This type of attention involves continuously sampling incoming information to determine its relevance to the current task at hand. Certain stimuli, such as our names or callsigns, have a strong ability to capture our attention. Selective attention allows the individual to prioritize and process the most important or relevant information and helps him/her to concentrate on a particular stimuli. Divided Attention: Divided attention refers to the ability of our central decision-making system to distribute its focus among multiple tasks. For example, a pilot flying a visual approach must divide their attention between maintaining the correct approach path and regularly checking instruments for critical information like airspeed, altitude, and engine performance. This specific question mentions that pilots are engaged in instrument monitoring. It's safe to assume that automation is in use, meaning the pilots would mostly be employing selective attention. It's worth noting that the initial feedback did not specify which option EASA considered correct. Therefore, we would greatly appreciate any additional feedback on this question.",

One of the drawbacks of automation is that pilots who are used to letting the aircraft fly itself are sometimes insufficiently trained in hand-flying, as they really practise their manual flying only in annual simulator check rides. Therefore, pilots should regularly disconnect automated system and practice hand-flying their aircraft to keep up their flying skills, which they might need when automation fails. In regular passenger flights, for example, an ILS approach does not necessarily need to be automatic until braking on the runway, pilots should be encouraged to disconnect the autopilot and perform the localiser and glide slope interceptions themselves. \"2. Increased likelihood of slips while programming automatic systems\" CORRECT. Highly automated systems often contain many different modes. It is important that the pilots are aware of the active modes and understand the relevant actions and responses to use the system properly. They must possess knowledge of the configurations of an aircraft and their interactions with the modes of the automatic flight system in use. Lack of understanding or inadequate initial training of the system user may lead to errors on the user's part such as selecting inadequate system function/mode or action for the particular phase of flight. \"3.

It is important that the effective instructor understands the subject being taught, the learner, the learning process, and the interrelationships that exist. An effective instructor also realizes learning is a complex procedure and assists each learner in reaching the desired outcomes while helping build self-esteem and confidence. It is important that the instructor adapts his instruction to the level of the trainee. \"2. motivation\" CORRECT. People learn and remember only what they wish to know. Without motivation there is little chance for recall. The most effective motivation is based on positive or rewarding objectives. To keep learning pleasant and to maintain motivation, an instructor should make positive comments about the learner’s progress before discussing areas that need improving. \"3. feedback on the results of learning\" CORRECT. As a learner practices a skill, it is important that he or she perform the skill correctly and that the skill being practiced is one that needs to be developed to maturity. An instructor ensures a skill is practiced correctly by monitoring the practice and providing feedback about the skill development. The learner profits by having someone watch the performance and provide constructive criticism to help eliminate errors. Providing compliments on aspects of the skill that were performed correctly help keep the evaluation positive. Allowing the learner to critique his or her performance enhances learner-centered training. \"4. a large amount of reference material\" INCORRET. Having different resources available to get information from is good. Each learner can select for him/herself which approach will work best. However, learners can get overwhelmed by too many resources (excessive options). It is difficult for learners to make decisions on how to learn when they are facing with a large amount of learning resources. A good instructor should guide the student through the many available options. \"5. being free from time restrictions.\" INCORRET.

Motor programmes are stored routines that enable patterns of behaviour to be executed without continuous conscious control. Motor programmes are stored in the procedural part of long-term memory and are retrieved when a skill shall be performed. Motor programmes enable an individual to perform more than one task at the same time by freeing mental resources – this way, one task can be performed requiring conscious attention, while performing another one at an unconscious level (motor programme). According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Practising these routines allow a person to move up the phases over time, making the motor program more automatic. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

It is a natural reaction that helps individuals cope with demanding circumstances by activating the body's \"fight or flight\" response. Stressors can be subdivided into internal (subjective) and external (objective) stressors. Another possible classification of stressors distinguishes between different categories, all of which can be subjective or objective: Environmental Stressors – environmental conditions, noise, vibrations, cosmic radiation, accelerations. Physiological Stressors – fatigue, lack of physical fitness, improper eating habits, hunger, thirst, cold/too hot, humidity, dehydration. Psychological/emotional stress – inter-personal conflicts, discrimination, fear of failure, death of a relative, divorce, financial problems, job insecurity. Domestic stressors – Social stressors (marriage, pregnancy or death), Economic stressors (bank loans, partner's loss of job, children's Christmas wishes, etc) and Environmental stressors (defective air conditioning or contruction sites close-by). Occupational or organisational stressors – strict policies and protocols implemented by the organization, restricted possibilities for professional and personal self-growth and conflicts among individuals in a department or between organizational groups. The death of a spouse, partner, or child has been identified as causing more stress than any other event. Certain airlines have policies in place to temporarily remove pilots from flying duties if they experience such a loss. This is because the stress levels of the pilot may be significantly elevated, potentially leading to a severe decline in performance and reaction times.",

This is where motor programmes and divided attention come into play. Motor programmes are stored routines that enable patterns of behaviour to be executed without continuous conscious control. Motor programmes enables an individual to perform more than one task at the same time by freeing mental resources – this way, one task can be performed requiring conscious attention, while performing another one at an unconscious level (motor programme). Divided attention means a distribution of attention between two or more tasks that must be performed at the same time. However, due to the functioning principle of the human brain, attention can never really be divided. Instead, the brain is constantly switching back and forth between the tasks, always performing one of them at a time.",

In other words, Risky shift occurs when people change their decisions or opinions to become more extreme and risky when acting as part of a group, compared with acting individually. It is quite a simple concept really, and you may have seen its effects before. One of the potential causes of risky shift is mentioned in this question, by the fact that the individual members of the group see their decision as less risky as the blame for any problems could be shared (this is often a subconscious thought). That is not the only reason that risky shift occurs though, there are other psychological factors at play.",

Therefore, in a high workload environment, when a pilot's mind is already very busy on another task such as flying the aircraft or coordinating an abnormal situation, their communications will usually become lesser, as to not take up as much time, nor processing power in their already nearly saturated minds. This is one of the largest reasons to have SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) which dictate what communications should be made, as it 'takes a load off' the pilot's mind, and allows the correct communication to be made without unnecessary stress or workload.",

In Rasmussen's model, he lays out three different layers of behaviours: Skill-based behaviours. Rule-based behaviours. Knowledge-based behaviours. It is therefore known as the \"SRK model\". The annex describes each type of behaviour, but in simple terms, skill-based behaviours are the lowest tier, items that are completed without thinking, rule-based behaviours are items that are completed from procedures already set out (from memory or written down) and knowledge-based behaviours, the highest tier, are when significant thought has to be put into something (and no specific rules are set out for it). This scenario required a bit of thought from the pilot, and reference to a procedure, making it a rule-based behaviour. The problem occurred in that the pilot misidentified the warning, which they had to think about, therefore ruling out that it might be a skill-based behaviour mistake (which would be an automatic - no thought required - reaction). There is a set procedure in place (whether by memory or in the checklist), so it is not a knowledge-based behaviour. The errors associated with rule-based behaviours are: Error of commission (doing something that should not have been done) Departure from rules interruptions violations This scenario is a classic case of \"doing the wrong thing, the correct way\", and is an error of commission.",

The development of procedures makes pilots more effective and reliable in their activities - a process called - procedural consistency.

You could also look upon it as a tendency to ignore information that confirms a decision is a poor one. A good strategy to avoid confirmation bias is to actively search for information that could falsify the mental model of the current situation or for different interpretations of the given information. Crew-climate (in other words, working atmosphere) also affects situational awareness. For example, an unresolved conflict between crewmember uses up resources that cannot be directed to flight-related activities, thereby greatly reducing situational awareness. Motivation plays an important role on situational awareness. If motivation is too low (i.e., the task at hand is considered irrelevant), a person will have to force him/herself to concentrate on what he/she is doing. This will increase the probability of distractions interfering with the task, attention will generally be low. On the other hand, high motivation comes along with high levels of arousal. Consequently, situational awareness is lost.",

This paper discusses the ways in which automation of industrial processes may expand rather than eliminate problems with the human operator. The thoughts of Bainbridge on the topic of automation from nearly forty years ago are just as relevant today, if not more so. Irony 1: Designers are human too! One of the ironies of designers attempting to eliminate humans from the system, is that operating problems may occur due to errors introduced by designers => humans are not removed from the system. Irony 2: Tasks that are not automated rely on humans Once people are eliminated as much as possible in the design, the human operator is left with an arbitrary collection of tasks that the designer could not eliminate. Whatever human tasks remain may not comprise a cohesive, meaningful or satisfying job role. Decisions tend to only consider allocating a task to a human or an automated system; when in fact, a more dynamic allocation of function may be more appropriate (i.e. allocation depending upon the scenario). Irony 3: The human may have to ‘take over’ if the system fails Automated systems can malfunction and then have to be repaired by human beings. Which means that even after it has been completed and is in use, automated systems depend on human work.",

According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

Procedural Memory: stores information about motor skills e.g. interaction of muscles and balance involved in riding a bicycle. Episodic Memory: stores information about past events which can be affected by suggestion e.g. last year’s holidays (can be unreliable). Amnesia usually affects only episodic memory. Semantic Memory: stores general knowledge e.g. the meaning of words, grammar rules etc. It tends to be accurate and long lasting. Repetition (or rehearsing) is used to get information into it, combined with organising it, placing it into some sort of context or associating it with an emotion. The main limitation of the long-term memory is that information retrieval can be difficult. Therefore, knowledge stored in long-term memory should be pre-activated (with planning and anticipation) so it can be available when required and have the access time reduced.

            "explanation": "Expectations can act as obstacles to effective communication. When someone has a specific expectation about the message they are about to receive, they may unconsciously filter or interpret the information in a way that aligns with their preconceived notion. This can lead to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the actual message being communicated. To overcome this obstacle, it is important for both the sender and the receiver to be aware of their own biases and expectations. The sender should strive to communicate clearly and explicitly, using precise language to minimize the chances of misinterpretation. The receiver should practice active listening, setting aside assumptions and allowing themselves to fully understand the message being conveyed. Expectations in communication have been responsible for several accidents, with one common example being when a flight crew anticipates their request to air traffic control to be approved. If the controller's response is unclear, abbreviated, too soft, or delivered rapidly, there is a risk that the expected approval is assumed by the crew. These incidents often occur when time is limited. The Tenerife disaster was influenced by multiple factors, including expectations in communication.",

When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information by various means, including speech. Officially, around 80% of all communication is achieved by factors other than words, otherwise known as metacommunication, which consists of those tools, other than the words, which complement them in order to communicate. The fact that somebody is not talking does not mean they are not communicating. It is said that 7% of communication is accomplished verbally, 38% by unconscious signals, such as tone of voice, and the remainder 55% by non-verbal means, such as body language. Non-verbal communication can accompany verbal communication, such as a smile during a face-to-face chat. Body language can be very subtle, but powerful – for example, the word “no” with a smile will be interpreted quite differently from one accompanied by a smack in the mouth. Non-verbal communication may also include written information or notes. Unfortunately, the side-by-side seating arrangements in the cockpit tend to lessen the effects of body language, so the choice of words (and their packaging) assumes a greater importance.",

The two types of fatigue are acute and chronic: Acute fatigue – short-term, more intense which usually affects the body, and just needs a good nights’ sleep to sort things out. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. In this case, normal or increased periods of sleep cannot restore the body's energy level and people do not even feel refreshed for a short time after a night's sleep. Fatigue affects physical and mental functions, and is accompanied by hypovigilance, thus also having an effect on work performance. Fatigue is usually accompanied by a noticeable lack of concentraction and memory. Some people with chronic fatigue have sleep difficulties as well. These can include finding it hard to get to sleep, waking up often during the night and/or waking up too early in the morning. In addition to the effects that can be found with acute fatigue, chronic fatigue can cause serious health issues such as cardiovascular or gastro-intestinal disease, reduced fertility, diabetes, asthma and mental disorders like depression.

On the third level there are only losses on both sides until mutual annihilation (lose-lose). Conflicting parties now no longer aim to have it \"their way\", they strive to cause the greatest damage to the opponent. Physical violence may be used. As seen above, the deeper you go towards the last level, the more primitive and inhuman the methods become by which the opponents try to win.

Being in a group natural changes the way people behave, in comparison to if they were alone. Larger groups tend to make riskier decisions that a single person would make, due to many reasons, which include an element of bravado, and a slightly macho attitude (this is known as risky shift, and is something to watch out for). Alternatively, groups can include the right people who foster a higher quality outcome, such as if a highly experienced, amiable captain is paired with a less confident junior first officer, the first officer will often perform well and may learn plenty of valuable tips and tricks along the way. Even the smallest group of people (2 of course), will cause an effect on the behaviour and decisions of both the members, which will differ somewhat from if they were alone. Larger groups do have a different effect to smaller groups, but there is always an effect at play. Another effect is groupthink, which can occur when each member wants to conform with the group's thinking and decisions, and not many opposite opinions are put forward.

The behaviour of a group can be affected by a number of factors including: Persuasion. Refers to the process of changing attitudes, opinions and behaviours of other group members. In contrast to negotiation, which implies retreating and meeting somewhere in the middle, persuasion means to make people completely abandon their point of view to accept the persuader's one. Pilots should not suppress opinions which could lead to a better outcome. Conformity. Concerns the likelihood of an individual to go along with a group decision. The idea of being integrated into the team, to be recognised as a leader, or to avoid conflicts, may lead to a disposition to agree with decisions made by others. This tendency increases when new people enter an existing group. This poses the threat for the group to lose valuable input, as it becomes difficult to voice an alternate opinion. Compliance. Compliant behaviour is shown in groups when requested by another group memeber or the leader. The aim being to be socially accepted, receive a reward or avoid punishment. Obedience. Being obedient means following the orders of someone with a higher social status just because the orders were given.

However, they make an error by not completing the appropriate checklist. Checklists are designed to guide pilots through critical procedures and ensure that all necessary actions are taken to address the issue. By not completing the checklist, they may overlook important steps or fail to identify potential risks. Continuing to use non-essential electrical equipment: Even after detecting the failure, the crew continues to use non-essential electrical equipment. This decision could further drain the limited power supply from the batteries and reduce the available time to make critical decisions or take corrective actions. Failure to properly assess the risk: The crew does not adequately assess the risk associated with the problem. They are aware that the batteries are expected to last for only 30 minutes, but they do not consider the consequences of using non-essential electrical equipment and how it may impact the remaining power reserve. Poor evaluation of available options: The Commander decides not to divert to the nearest suitable aerodrome, which is 20 minutes away. Instead, they choose to continue to the destination, which is 30 minutes away. This decision shows poor evaluation of available options, as diverting to the nearest aerodrome would have been a safer choice given the limited remaining battery life. Failure to review the decision: After deciding to continue to the destination, the crew does not review or reassess their decision, even when faced with a complete electrical failure during the approach. A lack of review means they miss the opportunity to recognize the increasing risk and reconsider their plan. In summary, the crew correctly recognizes the initial failure but makes a series of decision-making errors by not completing the checklist, continuing to use non-essential electrical equipment, poorly evaluating options, and failing to review their decision. These errors lead to a critical situation during the approach to the destination, with the loss of critical flight instruments due to a complete electrical failure.",

They are usually right. IMPULSIVITY (“do it quickly”) – If you feel the need to act immediately and do the first thing that comes to mind without considering the best solution to a problem, then you are exhibiting impulsivity. Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible.

The capacity of the working memory is limited to 5 plus/minus 2 items (7 plus/minus 2 according to the old syllabus), which can be stored for an average period of 15 to 20 seconds. Some information can last in short-term memory for up to a minute if rehearsal strategies are used. The information in short-term memory is also highly susceptible to interference. Any new information that enters short-term memory will quickly displace old information. Similar items in the environment can also interfere with short-term memories. A process called chunking (creating information chunks, made up of individual items) can increase the amount that can be stored in the working memory, but does take some thought (and would not be used for a squawk code). Therefore, to answer the question, \"The pilot could not store all 4 digits in their working memory at once.\" This would not be a problem, especially as the numbers are linked (one big 4-digit number), the squawk code should only really take up one \"slot\" worth of working memory (maybe sightly more than one, but certainly not close to 5 of course. \"The information was lost from the working memory because of the interruption.\" Correct. Interruptions take the mind away from what is stored in the working memory and cause time to pass, so it is more difficult to remember after the conversation. \"The pilot could not recall the transponder code from their long-term memory.\" The transponder code will not have reached their long-term memory, only their working memory. \"The pilot did not \"chunk\" the digits to make them more memorable, and therefore lost them from memory.\" The pilot would not need to \"chunk\" a 4 digit number to keep it in the working memory, but by remembering it as a 4-digit number instead of 4 x 1-digit numbers, it is naturally \"chunked\" anyway.

A team's power comes from the members' differing backgrounds, experience levels, and skillsets. We'd even go so far as to argue that you don't really need a team if everyone thinks the same. So, to build a team that is not only cohesive, but productive, it's important to encourage everyone to share their ideas, feedback, concerns and constructive criticism. The crew being rather small also promotes cohesion by how often crew members interact with each other. Cohesion describes the extent to which members of a group experience a sense of community. Team spirit results from high cohesion and promotes that individual members set aside their individual needs in favour of a group context (achieving a common goal).",

As a result, automation is increasingly prevalent in aviation. Automation is intended to support pilots rather than supplant them, enabling them to focus on higher-level decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Automation systems can execute routine tasks while pilots can focus on decision making and cross-checking. However, this shift presents new challenges the pilots must be aware of, in order to use automation efficiently. DANGERS OF AUTOMATION 1. Hypovigilance and loss of situational awareness. Automation can lead to a reduced state of alertness due to boredom and lack of physical activity. Pilots may become too focused on monitoring automated systems, potentially missing important cues or developments in their surroundings. 2. Automation complacency. Overreliance on automation may lead to complacency among pilots, where they become overly reliant on automated systems, potentially not checking the system as often as needed. 3. Blinkered attention. Pilots may develop tunnel vision or blinkered attention, concentrating solely on monitoring automated systems, potentially missing broader situational factors or unexpected events. 4. Mode errors. Incorrectly configuring or selecting automation modes can result in mode errors, where the aircraft behaves differently from what the pilot intended, possibly leading to unsafe situations. 5. Reduced crew communication. Overreliance on automation may decrease crew communication, as pilots may communicate less when automation systems handle many tasks. Automation is used during commercial flights in order to increase flight safety. In emergency situations, the pilots may need to revert to manual flying, depending on the nature of the emergency.",

An ergonomic source of error is, for example, cockpit noise and the restriction of the field of view due to windscreen design. Ideally, the principle of design ensures that the job required should be fitted to the man rather than the man to the job – this is not always the case. Economics. Pilots are required to make operation as economic as possible. Such pressure can result in incautious decisions.

When individuals are motivated, they are more likely to persevere through challenges and setbacks, which are common in the learning process. Successful learning experiences can reinforce motivation. When students see their efforts translating into progress and success, it often boosts their motivation to continue learning and striving for more achievements. They feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can increase their enthusiasm for further learning. This motivation stems from the recognition that their efforts have been productive. With increased motivation, students are more likely to invest additional effort and time into their studies. They become more willing to deal with new challenges or take on new learning opportunities. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE LEARNING PROCESS While a student's level of motivation plays a significant role in their learning journey, it's not the only factor at play. Learning is a multifaceted process influenced by various elements. These include the quality of instruction, the motivation of the instructor, the learning environment, available resources, the learner's prior knowledge, and their individual characteristics. In essence, effective learning arises from the interplay of several factors, with motivation being just one piece of the puzzle. While motivation is a crucial factor in the learning process, it's not an absolute prerequisite for all types of learning, and its role can vary among individuals.",

Common effects of stress include: On your body On your mood On your behaviour Headache Anxiety Overeating or undereating Muscle tension or pain Restlessness Angry outbursts Chest pain Lack of motivation or focus Drug or alcohol misuse Fatigue Feeling overwhelmed Tobacco use Change in sex drive Irritability or anger Social withdrawal Stomach upset Sadness or depression Exercising less often To go through each option: \"Fast breathing\" Stress can indeed trigger the \"fight or flight\" response in the body, causing an increase in breathing rate, however, this is a bodily change, not a behavioural one. \"Unreliability\" Given recent feedback, this is correct. We think that it is tenuous to say that a direct behavioural effect of stress is unreliability, as unreliability occurs from a combination of factors, some of which are changed by stress, however, unreliability is a change to a person's behaviour, and the level of someone's unreliability is affected by stress levels, so we think it is an acceptable answer in the context. \"Headaches\" Stress can cause tension style headaches and migraines due to neurological processes and from the increased tension within muscles in the upper body, face and neck. It is debatable whether or not this could be considered a behavioural change at all though, whilst it could cause a change in behaviour, we think that it is not one itself. It was previously reported as correct, but we believe that was wrong or has changed since. \"Hormonal disorder\" Chronic stress can disrupt the balance of hormones in the body, leading to a range of disorders such as adrenal fatigue or thyroid dysfunction, but this is not a behavioural change (again, it could lead to behavioural changes, but is not one itself).",

            "explanation": "Arousal is “the measure of the human being’s readiness to respond”. Arousal can manifest in various ways, including increased heart rate, heightened awareness, increased muscle tension, and a heightened state of consciousness. High vigilance is a state of sustained attention, alertness, and watchfulness for the detection of specific events, stimuli, or changes in the environment. It involves maintaining a heightened state of awareness over an extended period of time to identify and respond to rare or unexpected occurrences or potential threats. The state of vigilance is the degree of activation of the central nervous system. This can vary from deep sleep to extreme alertness and is controlled by the circadian cycle. A long-haul North Atlantic flight is generally calm and uneventful. During the cruise phase of such flights, when there are fewer critical tasks to perform, stress and arousal levels for pilots tend to be lower compared to more active phases like takeoff and landing. However, maintaining vigilance is crucial to monitor the aircraft systems, weather conditions, and any potential changes or emergencies that may occur during the flight.",

After methodical training, a rate of 1 to 100 is considered to be realistic and pretty good. A checklist can be used to reduce the effects of human memory and attention limitations by ensuring consistency and completeness. In order for a checklist to provide valuable assistance for crew members, certain design criteria should be observed: 1. The most critical items on the task-checklist should be listed as close as possible to the beginning of the task-checklist, in order to increase the likelihood of completing the item before interruptions may occur. 2. The more items a checklist has, the more likely one of them is forgotten. A long checklist should be subdivided to smaller task-checklists or chunks that can be associated with systems and functions within the cockpit. Division of pages should be obtained with protruding thumb locators. 3. Sequencing of checklist items should follow the “geographical” organization of the items in the cockpit, and be performed in a logical flow (panel scan sequence). We note that this guideline could conflict with Nos. 1 above. In most cases where this occurs, this guideline (No. 3) should take precedence. 4. The most critical items should be emphasized by use of colour, bold, italics or upper case. 5. Checklists should be designed in such a way that their execution will not be tightly coupled with other tasks - to ensure maximum attention is devoted to the checklist execution. 6. Check lists should be unambiguous and easy to read, presented in easily understood language.",

An ergonomic source of error is, for example, cockpit noise and the restriction of the field of view due to windscreen design. Ideally, the principle of design ensures that the job required should be fitted to the man rather than the man to the job – this is not always the case. Economics.

ANTI-AUTHORITY (“don’t tell me”) – You display this attitude if you resent having someone tell you what to do, or you regard rules and procedures as unnecessary. Antidote – Follow the rules. They are usually right. IMPULSIVITY (“do it quickly”) – If you feel the need to act immediately and do the first thing that comes to mind without considering the best solution to a problem, then you are exhibiting impulsivity. Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Pilots with a macho attitude are always trying to impress others and prove themselves by taking unnecessary risks. Both men and women are susceptible to a macho attitude, which leads to foolish and often dangerous behaviour. While pilots must have a high level of confidence in their abilities, it’s important to avoid becoming overconfident and adopting a macho attitude. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible. This feeling can cause you to leave the action to others – for better or worse. Antidote – I am not helpless. I can make a difference.",

Encourages a relaxed and laid-back atmosphere in the cockpit with communications leaning towards non-professional subjects. Has a primary aim to please the rest of the crew. Self-centred Cockpit: A self-centred cockpit is one where crew members tend to do their own thing without telling the others what is going on.

Internal factors of error generation lie within the person making the error and can have physiological or psychological reasons.",

            "explanation": "Fatigue is a feeling of constant tiredness or weakness and can be physical, mental or a combination of both. The two types of fatigue are acute and chronic: Acute fatigue – short-term, more intense which usually affects the body, and just needs a good nights’ sleep to sort things out. Chronic fatigue – arises from more long-term effects, like many episodes of acute fatigue. In this case, normal or increased periods of sleep cannot restore the body's energy level and people do not even feel refreshed for a short time after a night's sleep. Fatigue affects physical and mental functions, and is accompanied by hypovigilance, thus also having an effect on work performance. Fatigue is usually accompanied by a noticeable lack of concentraction and memory. Other effects include reduced visual perception and hand-eye coordination and slower reaction times. The capacity to judge risk is also impaired. Fatigued people tend to be irritable and reduce communication with others. Fatigue can also result in micro sleep, short naps of up to 5 seconds. People are usually unaware of entering micro sleep, it cannot be consciously controlled and seriously jeopardises safety. In addition to the above, Chronic fatigue can cause serious health issues such as cardiovascular or gastro-intestinal disease, reduced fertility, diabetes, asthma and mental disorders like depression.",

Increases in arousal will result in the increase of performance, up to a point, called the break point, beyond which further arousal is dysfunctional to the outcome of performance. At the optimum arousal level, we are at our most efficient - optimum arousal happens just below the breakpoint. Regarding this question: Stress increases along with arousal. Initially, we experience eustress (positive stress) and then distress (negative stress). As previously mentioned, the point of highest performance (optimum arousal or stress) is just below the breakpoint. After this breakpoint, performance decreases as stress becomes overwhelming. However, arousal and stress will still increase.",
