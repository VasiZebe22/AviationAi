On a Lamberts Conformal Conical chart this is the point where the external cone forms the tangent and this parallel of latitude is known as the Parallel of Origin. In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels. The Parallel of Origin determines the Convergence Factor for the whole chart and is equal to the Sine of this latitude, i.e. the Sine of the Parallel of Origin. The Convergence Factor is also known (on a Lamberts Chart) as the 'Constant of the Cone' or simply 'n'. The equation for convergency is: Convergency = Change of Longitude x Convergence Factor Correct Answer: depends on the latitude of the parallel of origin and on difference n longitude f two positions.",

Angle “b” is the difference between 80ºE and 20ºE, so it is 60º. Angle “c” is 90º. The internal angles of a triangle must add up to 180º. So angle “a” must be 30º. Convergency = Change in Longitude, in a Polar Stereographic chart. Convergency is the amount by which a great circle track direction changes. Track at the highest point = 270ºT and at Longitude x = 200ºT Convergency = 270º - 200º = 70º Change in longitude = 70º Longitude when track equals 200ºT (at \"x\"): 20ºE + change in long = 20ºE + 70ºW = 050ºW ”W” because we are travelling in a westerly direction. To confirm this, we can find out angle “d” by adding all the angles of the triangle: 70º + 60º + 30º = 160º 180º - 160º = 20º Therefore, initial GCT from 50ºW to “A” equals 20ºT. Final GCT at 50ºW, from A, will be the reciprocral 20ºT + 180º = 200ºT",

Center your plotter at MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME, since the question asks for the initial track from MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the Initial True Track from MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME: 042o. Apply the variation 004oW (the track is closer to 004oW isogonal than to 003oW) on the true track to get the magnetic one: 042o + 4o = 046o (Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between the two points is 213/16 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 43 NM.",

Center your plotter at A point, since the question asks for the initial true track from A point. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the Initial True Track from A point 231o. Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between A and B points is 61/16 inches.

Chart Scale = Chart length / Earth distance On a Mercator chart, scale expands away from the Equator. The scale expansion is proportional to the secant of the latitude. Questions about scale in a Mercator chart, come in 1 of 4 basic types: Given scale at the Equator, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find scale at the Equator. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given a fixed chart distance between meridians, find Mercator scale at a specific latitude. The equation to remember to solve this questions is the following one: Scale denominator A x cos (Latitude B) = Scale denominator B x cos (Latitude A) You could use this formula, but you would come that the relation between the distances and the scale is a constant. Manipulating the formula we came out with this: Departure at A x cos (Latitude B) = Departure at B x cos (Latitude A) Departure at B = 70 x cos (30º) / cos (45º) = 86 nm",

For Rhumb Lines: Meridians are shown as straight lines. All other Rhumb Lines are concave toward the pole. This curvature is particularly noticeable in parallels of latitude. In the context of this Lambert chart, the standard parallels are 65ºN and 37ºN. The Parallel of Origin falls between these standard parallels, approximately at 51ºN. Consequently, when drawing a straight-line track from 49ºN 030ºW to 48ºN 040ºW, this track will be positioned south of the Parallel of Origin. The Great Circle track between these points will exhibit concavity toward the Parallel of Origin, which means it will be positioned south of the straight-line track. Similarly, the Rhumb Line Track will also show concavity towards the nearer pole and will lie on the equatorial side of the Great Circle Track. Therefore, it will be situated to the south of the Great Circle Track.",

NOTE: QDM is the reciprocal of QDR; QUJ is the reciprocal of QTE. Converting a Relative Bearing (RBI) into a True Bearing: Apply aircraft variation to the magnetic heading to get true heading. Add relative bearing to true heading in order to obtain true bearing TO the station If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station.

To plot a bearing in a Lambert chart we must apply the chart convergence, because there is chart convergence between the meridians where the bearing is measured (aircraft) and from it will be plotted (NDB). If you plot the true bearing of the NDB from the aircraft 097º, in a Lambert char the plot will be correct. The problem is when you need to plot the reciprocal from the meridian of the NDB, the line will not pass through the aircraft position. When drawing the line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian, chart convergence as been automatically allowed. Chart convergence = ch.long × sin parallel of origin Chart convergence = (006º00’- 004º45’) x sin ((65+37)/2) = 1º The reciprocal of 097º will have an angular value higher than 277º, that difference will be the chart convergence of 1º If the angle of 278º is measured from a line that is parallel to the aircraft meridian drawn to the NDB, the position line will pass trough the aircraft. Bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 277º + 1º = 278º",

Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, and what you remember from it, so we can make it as close to the real exam question as possible, thank you. On this zoomed in section of the ED-4 chart, there is only 1 obstacle indicated, with an elevation that corresponds with any of the answers. It is important to note that any AGL heights on the chart for obstacles are only added when the obstacle is over 1000 ft tall (AGL), and is added in brackets next to the elevation AMSL. 2 416 ft AMSL This is the correct answer, the wind turbine(s) just East of Freiburg have an elevation of 2 416 ft at their highest point. This elevation is the top of a turbine, so above the ground level, and would therefore have a height AGL (that is not 0 ft). We do not know the height AGL as the turbines must be less than 1000 ft tall. 2 418 ft AGL This point does not exist. The \"2418\" under the wind turbine on the chart is a spot height of terrain elevation, and would therefore mean that the terrain there reaches a highest point of 2 418 ft AMSL. 2 841 ft Again, this is a spot height of terrain elevation, East of the wind turbine. It is therefore not an \"obstacle\", it is only terrain, and would not have a height AGL (as it is the ground level). 1296 ft AGL or 2746 ft AMSL These two elevations are actually different spot heights of terrain elevation, so are not correct.",

In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. The Scale in Lambert conformal chart is only correct along the standard parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels.

Conversion angle = ½ Convergency Even though they make reference to a Lambert conformal chart, the exercise is not asking to plot the bearings on the chart, this is a simple convergency problem. We need to evaluate the convergency of a straight line on a Lambert conformal chart, similar to how we evaluate the convergency of a great circle on the Earth, and there is often a small difference between convergency on the chart and convergency on the Earth, as a straight line on the chart closely approximates, but is not exactly, a great circle track. On a Lambert Conformal Chart, the straight lines vary in direction by the chart convergency, so we can calculate this (very similar to Earth Convergency) Chart Convergency = Change in Longitude x Sin (Parallel of Origin) With the change in straight line track we will determine the convergency: Convergency = 301º - 292º = 9º Change in Longitude = 9º / sin (56,5º) = 10º47’ W",

Chart Scale = Chart length / Earth distance On a Mercator chart, the scale expands away from the Equator. The scale expansion is proportional to the secant of the latitude. Questions about scale in a Mercator chart, come in 1 of 4 basic types: Given scale at the Equator, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find scale at the Equator. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given a fixed chart distance between meridians, find Mercator scale at a specific latitude. The equation to remember to solve this question is the following one: Scale denominator A x cos (Latitude B) = Scale denominator B x cos (Latitude A) Distance on Earth, departure = 60 x 5º x cos (17º) = 287 nm As the units of length are in different units, first we must convert them into the same units: 1 nm = 1 852 m 287 nm = 531 524 m = 53 152 400 cm Chart scale at 17ºN = 5 / 53 152 400 = 1 / 10 630 480 With the scale at 17º N, we will determine the scale at 57º N: Scale denominator 57º = 10 630 480 x cos (57º) / cos (17º) = 6 054 319 Scale at 57º = 1 / 6 054 319",

Place the protractor over the VOR and match the radials on the map with the degrees on the protractor (it is as if the protractor was aligned with Magnetic North). You can see on the protractor at which degree the lines align to. Plot a 11 cm long line representing radial 023º.",

The needle always points to the beacon (QDM) and the tail of the needle gives the QDR.

To plot a bearing in a Lambert chart we must apply the chart convergence, because there is chart convergence between the meridians where the bearing is measured (aircraft) and from it will be plotted (NDB). If you plot the true bearing of the NDB from the aircraft 080º, in a Lambert char the plot will be correct. The problem is when you need to plot the reciprocal from the meridian of the NDB, the line will not pass through the aircraft position, When drawing the line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian, chart convergence as been automatically allowed. Chart convergence = ch.long × sin parallel of origin Chart convergence = (12º55’- 009º58’) x sin (44º) = 2º Figure (b) show as that the reciprocal of of 080º will have an angular value higher than 260º, that difference will be the chart convergence of 2º. If the angle of 262º is measured from a line that is parallel to the aircraft meridian drawn to the NDB, the position line will pass trough the aircraft like in figure (b). Bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 260º + 2º = 262º",

            "explanation": "For this question you need a plotter to find the true track and a ruler to measure the distance between CLYDE and INPIP waypoints. Firstly, find the exact position of CLYDE and INPIP waypoints on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect them. Center your plotter at CLYDE waypoint, since the question asks for the initial true track from CLYDE. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the Initial True Track from CLYDE waypoint 135o. Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches from CLYDE waypoint until reaching the latitude of N55°, is 51/4 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 79 NM, which is closer to the option 81 NM.",

Generally, the scale for a Direct Mercator chart is given by the formula: Scale at any latitude = Scale at the Equator x 1/cos Latitude. The scale expands as the secant of the latitude. So, as scale varies with latitude, it is normal for a Mercator scale to be given at only one latitude, which is called \"scale latitude\" and for scale at other latitudes to be calculated using the formula above. When working with questions comparing distances and scales on a Mercator projection at different latitudes, we use the equation: \"ABBA\": Earth DistanceA(or Scale Lat A) x cos Lat B = Earth DistanceB(or Scale Lat B) x cos Lat A. For this question, using the \"ABBA\" equation, we get: Earth distance at 30o x cos 45o = Earth distance at 45o x cos 30o ⇒ Earth distance at 45o = (Earth distance at 30o x cos 45o) / cos 30o Earth distance at 45o = (80 NM x cos 45o) / cos 30o = 65 NM.",

Generally, the scale for a Direct Mercator chart is given by the formula: Scale at any latitude = Scale at the Equator x 1/cos Latitude. The scale expands as the secant of the latitude. So, as scale varies with latitude, it is normal for a Mercator scale to be given at only one latitude, which is called \"scale latitude\" and for scale at other latitudes to be calculated using the formula above. When working with questions comparing distances and scales on a Mercator projection at different latitudes, we use the equation: \"ABBA\": Earth Distance A(or Scale Lat A) x cos Lat B = Earth Distance B(or Scale Lat B) x cos Lat A. For this question, using the \"ABBA\" equation, we get: Earth distance at 30o x cos 45o = Earth distance at 45o x cos 30o ⇒ Earth distance at 45o = (Earth distance at 30o x cos 45o) / cos 30o Earth distance at 45o = (40 NM x cos 45o) / cos 30o = 32.6 NM.

Meridians are straight lines radiating from the pole which cut parallels of latitude at right angles. Parallels of latitude are shown as concentric circles and their distance apart increases away from the pole. Convergency is how much the Great circle track changes, because of the converging meridians and is correct where the chart is tangential to the reduced Earth, at the pole. Great circles at the point of tangency would be straight lines, but the tangential point is only a point, so you cannot draw a great circle there. Elsewhere, Great circles will actually be slightly curved concave to the pole, but near the pole can be assumed to be straight lines. Thus, since the meridians at the two positions converge with an angle of 30°, then the straight line (Great circle track) will change by the same amount, 30°.

However, in all other cases, a straight line represents only an approximate great circle, as it is a curve concave to the parallel of origin. Nonetheless, this difference is negligible and has no significant practical implications. Therefore, for practical purposes, any straight line on the chart can be considered as a Great Circle. \"sine of the parallel of origin is equal to the convergence factor.\" INCORRECT. The statement does not pertain to the question at hand since it merely asserts that the sine of the parallel of origin is equal to the convergence factor, which is true for all Lambert charts, but does not address the specific topic under consideration. \"straight line follows the parallel of origin.\" INCORRECT. By definition, if a line follows the parallel of origin, it must be a curved line, and not a straight line. If the statement was to be interpreted differently to mean that a straight line connects two points lying exactly on the parallel of origin, but not following its curvature, then it could be correct. However, in this case, the line would be an exact great circle route, and not an approximate one as stated. PROPERTIES OF A LAMBERT CHART Scale Correct on the standard parallels. Contracted within the standard parallels. (least then 1% at parallel of origin). Expanded outside standard parallels. Orthomorphic Yes. All charts used for navigation must be. Graticule Meridians are straight lines, originating from the pole. Parallels are arcs of circles, centred at the pole. (The pole is always off the map). Parallel of Origin Mathematical basis of projection. Assumed to be halfway between the 2 standard parallels. Chart Convergence Constant across the chart = Earth Convergence. Chart convergence = ch.long × sin parallel of origin Rhumb Lines Meridians are straight lines. All other Rhumb Lines are concave to the pole (i.e. parallels of latitude). Great Circles Meridians are straight lines. At the parallel of origin - near-straight line. At any other latitude, a curve concave to the parallel of origin.",

(2) Identify direction. Rhumb line track is 270º => \"A\" will be on the right; \"B\" on the left. (3) Rhumb line track = 270º. As you can see on the attached figure, great circle track will be greater than 270º by the value of conversion angle: 270º + 60º = 330º.

Generally, the scale for a Direct Mercator chart is given by the formula: Scale at any latitude = Scale at the Equator x 1/cos Latitude. The scale expands as the secant of the latitude. So, as scale varies with latitude, it is normal for a Mercator scale to be given at only one latitude, which is called \"scale latitude\" and for scale at other latitudes to be calculated using the formula above. When working with questions comparing distances and scales on a Mercator projection at different latitudes, we use the equation \"ABBA\": Earth DistanceA(or Scale LatA) x cos LatB = Earth DistanceB (or Scale LatB )x cos LatA. For this question, using the \"ABBA\" equation, we get: Scale at 22o x cos 35o = Scale at 35o x cos 22o ⇒ Scale at 22o = (200 000 x cos 22o) / cos 35o = 226 376.

Place the protractor over the Manchester (MCT) VOR/DME and match the radials on the map with the degrees on the protractor (it is as if the protractor was aligned with Magnetic North). Now draw a line extending from that radial. Alternatively, over MCT VOR/DME, draw a line parallel to the nearest meridian (True North reference). Using the protractor, measure the angle of 043º (*) between the TN reference. Plot this on the chart. (*) Remember for True bearing to radial: EAST is LEAST (we subtract the variation from the true track) WEST is BEST (we add the variation to the true track) the opposite applies when converting radial to True Bearing. Radial 045° - 2°W variation = 043° (true bearing) 2. Determine the distance: Remember that degrees of latitude are 60 NM apart. Using a ruler, measure the distance corresponding to 1º of latitude on the chart (60NM) and use it as a reference to draw a line corresponding to 58 NM. Final Position: 54°03’N 001°06’W",

If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station. QUJ = RBI + True Heading QTE = RBI + True Heading - 180º The exercise is asking us for a true bearing from the beacon to the aircraft (QTE): QUJ= 63º + 199º = 262º QTE = 63º + 199º - 180º = 82º Now to apply the convergency. The chart convergence here means that we can not just plot the reciprocal heading from an NDB, as this would give us a false position, as We have to account for the 8º convergency, and to work out how to do this, the best way is often to use a diagram like the one above, and note that the red angle is smaller at the NDB than the same angle would be at the aircraft, so therefore the red angle is 8º smaller than the reciprocal bearing of 082º. This can also be done without drawing if you are adept at using the DIID method, but be careful, that way is much easier to make a mistake. True bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 082º - 8º = 074º",

            "explanation": "For this question you need a plotter, to find the track, and a ruler, to measure the distance between A and B. According to the options below the question, we are looking for the magnetic track and the distance in NM. Firstly, find the position of A and B point on your Jeppesen chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at point A, since the question asks the initial track from position A. Align the upper section of your plotter with the line which connects A and B points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The aligned with the track A to B plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 022o. But, we are looking for the magnetic track. The points are between the isogonals 0o E and 1oE, but much closer to the 1oE isogonal. Following the rhyme: Variation East, Magnetic Least, you have to subtract the variation 1oE from the True Track, found previously, to get the magnetic track. So, 022oT-1o=021oM. Finally, a ruler is required to measure the distance between A and B in inches and, moreover, conversion from inches into nautical miles has to be done, applying the chart scale 1in=15NM, depicted at the upper section of the E(LO)2 Jeppesen chart. The distance between A and B in inches, is measured as 4 14/16 inches. Therefore, according to the chart scale, 4 14/16 inches on the chart correspond to: 4 14/16 x 15 = 73 NM on the ground.",

Generally, the scale for a Direct Mercator chart is given by the formula: Scale at any latitude = Scale at the Equator x 1/cos Latitude. The scale expands as the secant of the latitude. So, as scale varies with latitude, it is normal for a Mercator scale to be given at only one latitude, which is called \"scale latitude\" and for scale at other latitudes to be calculated using the formula above. When working with questions comparing distances and scales on a Mercator projection at different latitudes, we use the equation \"ABBA\": Earth DistanceA(or Scale LatA) x cos LatB = Earth DistanceB(or Scale LatB) x cos LatA. For this question, using the \"ABBA\" equation, we get: Scale at 23o x cos 56o = Scale at 56o x cos 23o ⇒ Scale at 56o = (2 761 515 x cos 56o) / cos 23o = 1 677 579.

Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the Initial True Track from ISLE OF MAN VOR/DME 101o. At ISLE OF MAN VOR/DME, the variation is 003oW, thus the Initial Magnetic Track is: 101o + 3o = 104o. Furthermore, it is known that the chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of each E(LO) chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between ISLE OF MAN VOR/DME and POLE HILL VOR/DME points is 63/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 95 NM.",

The orientation of the Earth’s axis to the sun is always changing throughout the year, as we revolve around the sun. Sometimes the axis points towards and other times away from the sun. As this orientation changes throughout the year, so does the distribution of sunlight on Earth’s surface at any given latitude. People who live in the mid-latitudes, far from both the Equator and the poles, enjoy maximum daylight on the summer solstice and put up with maximum darkness on the winter solstice. Between the two extremes, sunlight increases or decreases each day, but the rate of change is not steady. The change of duration of daylight period is slowest in the June and December solstices (Solstice means “the Sun stands still”). It increases in the transition periods, and reaches its maximum halfway at the two equinoxes (when the sun is over the Equator). From its slowest of 1 minute per day in January and June it increases to 3 minutes in March and September.",

The more perpendicular the rays hit the ground, the more heat is absorbed, and the hotter the average temperature will be. If the Sun's rays hit at a more oblique angle, the same total energy is shared out over a larger area, so the ground will not receive as much energy, causing lower average temperatures. As you can see in the attached figure: In July, the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, and therefore the angle at which the Sun's rays strike Earth is more perpendicular at 25ºN and more oblique at 25ºS => It will be warmer at 25ºN In January, the Southern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, and therefore the angle at which the Sun's rays strike Earth is more perpendicular at 25ºS and more oblique at 25ºN => It will be warmer at 25ºS, so colder at 25ºN",

Both locations are in the Southern Hemisphere. On 21st of September, the Southern Hemisphere's Spring Equinox is experienced, when the duration of the day and night are equal and the Sun crosses the Equator from North to South. After the Spring Equinox, at latitudes between the Equator and the Antarctic Circle (between 00º N/S and 66.5º S), the length of the daylight progressively increases, until it reaches at its maximum on 21st of December, when the Summer Solstice is experienced. For a specific day of the fore mentioned period, as the latitude increases (i.e. going further South), the length of the daylight increases too (the sunrise occurs earlier and the sunset later). Thus, the duration of the daylight at location B with latitude 8ºS (lower latitude) will be shorter than that at location A with latitude 37ºS (higher latitude). When it comes to the rate of change of the apparent solar day, this is effectively saying how much does the length of sunlight change from day to day. (i.e. -5 minutes per day, +1 minute per day, etc.). This is simpler than it sounds. When you discount the polar regions encountering 24 hour day or 24 hour night, the daylight time changes more per day at higher latitudes. Therefore, the change of daylight time per day at location B (8ºS) will be less than at the higher latitude of 30ºS",

The times given in the Air Almanac are calculated for the Greenwich meridian, but can be taken as LMT at all longitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of the year. Higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter, because of the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. The morning civil twilight starts when the centre of the Sun is 6o below the sensible horizon and ends at sunrise. The evening civil twilight starts at sunset and ends when the centre of the Sun is 6o below the sensible horizon. For this question: Use the upper \"SUNSET\" table to find the sunset LMT (the start of the evening civil twilight) for 11th October interpolating for N41°06' (between N40° - N45°): 17:25. Use the lower \"EVENING CIVIL TWILIGHT\" table to find the end of the evening civil twilight LMT (when the centre of the Sun is 6o below the sensible horizon) for 11th October interpolating for N41°06' (between N40° - N45°): 17:53. The duration of the evening civil twilight at Xiaolin Zi Airport is between 17:25 and 17:53. Thus, it lasts 28 minutes.",

            "explanation": "Since the question asks us to find the Twilight duration, we must use both tables provided. (1) Determine the Sunrise Time: Step 1: Locate the date and the latitude. 27th of January is between 26th and 29th of January. 66º48’N is between 66ºN and 68ºN. Step 2: Interpolate the data. Interpolate 68ºN row: △Date : △ Time 26 – 29 is equivalent to 0947 – 0933: 3 days changes in date is equal to 14 minute changes in time. Therefore, 1 day change in date is equivalent to -14/3 = approx. -5 min. If we look at the table, we can see that time is reducing as the date is increasing. Sunrise at 68ºN = 0947 – 0005 = 0942 LMT Interpolate 66ºN row: △Date : △ Time 26 – 29 is equivalent to 0920 – 0909: 3 days is equal to 11 min. Therefore, 1 day is equivalent to -11/3 = approx. -4 min. Sunrise at 66ºN = 0920 – 0004 = 0916 LMT Interpolate 37th column: △latitude : △ Time 68º - 66º is equivalent 0942 – 0916: 2º change in latitude equals 26 min changes in sunrise time. Therefore, 1º change in latitude is equivalent to 13 min changes in sunrise time. To find the amount of sunrise times changes within 48’ changes in latitude: 48’ x 13 min = 10 min. Sunrise at 66º48’N equals 0916 + 0010 = 0926 LMT Latitude/Date 26th 27th 29th 68º 0947 0942 0933 66º48’ 0926 66º 0920 0916 0909 Having found the sunrise time, to find the twilight duration, we need to find the time of morning civil twilight (the same procedure applies). (2) Determine the Morning Civil Twilight time: Step 1: Locate Date and Latitude. Step 2: Interpolate the data. Interpolate 68ºN row. △Date : △ Time 26 – 29 is equivalent to 0826 – 0817: 3 days changes in date is equal to 9 min changes in time. Therefore, 1 day change in date is equivalent to -9/3 = approx. -3 min. MCT at 68ºN (27th) = 0826 – 0003 = 0823 LMT Interpolate 66ºN row. △Date : △ Time 26 – 29 is equivalent to 0811 – 0803: 3 days changes in date is equal to 8 min changes in time. Therefore, 1 day change in date is equivalent to -8/3 = approx. 3 min. MCT at 66ºN (27th) = 0811 – 0003 = 0808 LMT Interpolate 37th column: △latitude : △ Time 68º - 66º is equivalent 0823 – 0808: 2º change in latitude equals 15 min changes in sunrise time. Therefore, 1º change in latitude is equivalent to 7.5 min changes in sunrise time. To find the amount of sunrise times changes within 48’ changes in latitude: 48’ x 7.5 min = 6 min. Sunrise at 66º48’N equals 0808 + 0006 = 0814 LMT Latitude/Date 26th 27th 29th 68º 0826 0824 0817 66º48’ 0814 66º 0811 0808 0803 Sunrise is at 0926 LMT, and it is the end of the morning civil twilight.

The times given in the Air Almanac are calculated for the Greenwich meridian, but can be taken as LMT at all longitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of the year. Higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter, because of the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. For this question: Find the LMT sunset for 3rd of October 2017 interpolating for N67°16' (between N66° - N68° and between 2nd - 5th Oct.): 17:17 (approx) * Convert Arc to Time: Bodo airport is 14o 22' East off Greenwich, which corresponds to: 14º x 4 min + 22' x 4 sec = 57 minutes of time. Convert LMT sunset into UTC: The Earth rotates from West to East, thus the UTC sunset at Bodo airport on the 3rd of October 2017 is: 17:17 - 57 min = 16:20 UTC. NOTE: Arc to time conversions: 360º = 24 hours, 15º = 1 hour, 1º = 4 minutes, 1' = 4 seconds. * Refer to the attached figure. 68ºN on the 2nd ⇒ 17:20 68ºN on the 5th ⇒ 17:07 66ºN on the 2nd ⇒ 17:23 66ºN on the 5th ⇒ 17:11 67ºN? 2nd: (20 + 23) ÷ 2 = 21.5 ⇒ 17:21.5 5th: (7 + 11) ÷ 2 = 9 ⇒ 17:09 Now we must determine 67ºN on the 3rd: 12.5 ÷ 3 = 4.17 min 21.5 - 4.17 = 17.33 min 67ºN on the 3rd ⇒ approx. 17:17",

The duration of daytime and nighttime depends on: The date: As the Earth's axis of spin is tilted at 23.5º its axis of orbit around the Sun, the area of the Earth that is lit by the Sun changes slightly every day throughout the Solar Year. This makes the duration of day and night differ throughout the year. The latitude: This goes hand-in-hand with the point above. On a day in June, the Northern Hemisphere is going to be tilted towards the Sun, and the further North you are, the longer the day will be, whereas in the Southern hemisphere on that same day, the further South you are, the shorter the day (the longer the night). This reverses in December, for example. The altitude: At higher altitude, you are further away from the Earth and its horizon, so the Sun rises a little earlier and sets a little later to your view, increasing the duration of the day and decreasing the duration of night. If you are on the ground, this depends on the elevation, of course (which is just a different term).",

It is a system based on the observation of the sun position in the sky. The sun appears to describe a 360º circle around the earth. For the observer the sun will change position 15º/h (360º/24h). LMTs difference = change longitude / 15 Local Mean Time is obtain determining at the local apparent noon at specific meridian. Local noon occurs at the same local time at all altitudes of the same meridian. Local Mean Time is inappropriate for use in a country as a standard time. Countries with cities with different longitudes, would have different LMT’s. Standard Time is the convention where clocks within a geographical region are synchronized to a single time standard. Each country defines its own Standard Time notified in the Air Almanac of its correction related to UTC. Each country tries to fix 1200 ST to occur at half period of light and 2400 ST to occur half of period of darkness. Universal Coordinated time (UTC) is the primary global standard time. To avoid confusions with different time zones and daylight saving time, UTC is the time used in aviation for air traffic control services, clearances, flight plans and weather forecast. It is often necessary convert LMT to UTC and vice-versa. Based on apparent movement of the sun from east to west: Longitude east, UTC is least Longitude west, UTC is best Summer Time / Daylight Saving Time is adopted in some countries within the summer months. Those are identified with an * in the Air Almanac. Summer Time is normally advanced 1 hour in advanced to Standard Time. To solve this exercise we need the information of the flight time that can be calculated using the average Distance and G/S: Departure = (10º35’ + 51º45’) x 60 x cos (53º) = 2251 nm Flight Time = 2251 / 375 = 06º00’ UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) is the datum for world time; next step is to convert the ST information to UTC. Tough the relationship between UTC and ST (only the hour difference) is not directly given, the longitude of both positions is given. Longitude east, 15°00’ (STB) - 04°00' = 11°00’ UTC at arrival Time before departure = 11º00 - 06º00’ = 05º00´ UTC Convert UTC to STA: Longitude west, 05°00’ (UTC) - 01°00' = 04°00’ ST at departure, the same day",

Its declination reaches a maximum equal to the angle of Earth's axial tilt (23.44°)on the June solstice, then decreases until reaching its minimum (−23.44°) on the December solstice, when its value is the negative of the axial tilt.

This yields: DEP: 0600 UTC at A; ARR: 1515 UTC at B; Flight time: 09h15min. Regarding the time between ARR and SS: SS at 1820 is in LMT, and you have ARR at B at 1515 UTC. You can convert it into LMT (or UTC) using the location of B: B is at 5°45’E, so 5.75°E with a rate of 15° per hour, which gives you 23 minutes to ADD (due to moving East); 1515 + 0023 = 1538 LMT. The duration is simply the difference between the two, so: 1820 - 1538 = 0242 Detailed explanation: Let's start by converting the estimated time of departure (ETD) from position A and the estimated time of arrival (ETA) at position B from ST to UTC. For position A, given ST = UTC - 5 or UTC = ST + 5 Since the ETD from position A is 01:00 ST March 12, we calculate: UTC = 01:00 March 12 + 05:00 = 06:00 March 12 For position B, given ST = UTC + 1 or UTC = ST - 1 Since the ETA at position B is 16:15 ST March 12, we calculate: UTC = 16:15 ST March 12 - 01:00 = 15:15 March 12 The expected flight time is: 15:15 - 06:00 = 09:15 Sunset at B occurs at 18:20 LMT. We'll convert the sunset time at B from LMT to UTC. Given the longitude of position B as Easterly (005°45.0'E), the UTC and LMT at position B are related as follows: UTC = LMT in position B - Time difference between Greenwich meridian and position B Let's find the time difference between the Greenwich meridian and position B: The sun travels an arc of 15° in 60 minutes. The sun travels an arc of 345' (= 5x60'+45') in x minutes. So, x = (60x345)/900 minutes = 23 minutes, which means the time difference between the Greenwich meridian and position B is 23 minutes. Thus, according to the relationship above, the time (UTC) of sunset at position B is: UTC = 18:20 March 12 - 00:23 = 17:57 March 12 The estimated time of arrival (ETA) at position B as 15:15 UTC March 12 and the sunset time at B as 17:57 UTC March 12, therefore we can infer that the aircraft is anticipated to arrive at position B 02:42 (= 17:57 - 15:15) before sunset.",

The times given in the Air Almanac are calculated for the Greenwich meridian, but can be taken as LMT at all longitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of the year. Higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter, because of the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. For this question: Find the LMT sunset for 19th of October 2017 interpolating for N67°16' (between N66° - N68° and between 17th - 20th Oct.): 16:14 (approx) * Convert Arc to Time: Bodo airport is 14o 22' East off Greenwich, which corresponds to: 14º x 4 min + 22' x 4 sec = 57 minutes of time. Convert LMT sunset into UTC: The Earth rotates from West to East, thus the UTC sunset at Bodo airport on the 19th of October 2017 is: 16:14 - 57 min = 15:17 UTC. NOTE: Arc to time conversions: 360º = 24 hours, 15º = 1 hour, 1º = 4 minutes, 1' = 4 seconds. * Refer to the attached figure. 68ºN on the 17th ⇒ 16:17 68ºN on the 20th ⇒ 16:05 66ºN on the 17th ⇒ 16:26 66ºN on the 20th ⇒ 16:15 67ºN? 17th: (17 + 26) ÷ 2 = 21.5 ⇒ 16:21.5 20th: (5 + 15) ÷ 2 = 10 ⇒ 16:10 Now we must determine 67ºN on the 19th: 11.5 ÷ 3 = 3.83 min 10 + 3.83 = 13.83 min 67ºN on the 19th ⇒ approx. 16:14",

In the Northern Hemisphere, the June solstice is the day when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky. At this date, within the spherical belt between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, the Sun stands overhead the observer. In the Southern Hemisphere, the December solstice is the day when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. The period of daylight is the time elapsed between sunrise and sunset. Around December 21st, the daylight and darkness are both 12 hour long on the equator. Going northwards to higher latitudes, the daylight becomes shorter and shorter to the North Pole with its 24-hour darkness. Going southwards to higher latitudes, the daylight becomes longer and longer to the south. Around June 21st, the Northern and Southern hemisphere interchange roles with full 24-hour daylight at the North Pole, and full day’s darkness in the South. Going northwards to higher latitudes, the daylight becomes longer and longer to the north. Going northwards, the days are shortest in December/January and longest in June/July during the year. With regards to this question, we can see that daylight is quite long and in July (Northern Hemisphere Summer). Therefore, we can say that we are at a high latitude north. In the Northern Hemisphere at 80ºN, so soon after the solstice, it is reasonable to assume that there will still be permanent daylight at such latitude. The only possible answer is 60ºN.",

            "explanation": "Since the Earth rotates from West to East, the Sun rises in the East before it does in the West. Therefore, time to the East is ahead (later) of time to the West. When crossing the International Date Line, there is a shift in your calendar day. Traveling in a westerly direction, from the western hemisphere (e.g., Hawaii) to the eastern hemisphere (e.g., Japan), results in the acquisition of an additional day. For example, if the date is January 1st, you will find yourself on January 2nd upon completion of the crossing. Conversely, when journeying eastward, the inverse occurs, causing a loss of a day in your calendar. Circumnavigating the globe: Travelling westwards around the world, you should set your clock: Back by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and Forward by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line. Traveling eastward around the world, you should set your clock: Forward by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and Back by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line. SUMMARY: Westerly - Add a day, Clock Time 'decreses' Easterly - Subtract a day, Clock Time 'increases' In this case, we are travelling eastwards. For every 15° of longitude crossed, the clock time goes one hour forward, so clock time 'increases' towards the destination. This means that the 12 hours time difference between departure and destination should be added to initial the clock time. We are also crossing the International Date Line eastbound, so when crossing we should set our clock back by 24 hours and the calendar date will go back one day.",

            "explanation": "To determine the UTC of the end of evening civil twilight (ECT) at Bodo airport in Norway (N67° 16', E014° 22') on October 19th, we need to first calculate the local mean time (LMT) of ECT. This can be done by consulting the relevant section of the EVENING CIVIL TWILIGHT table. Latitude 17 20 68º 17:15 17:04 66º 17:19 17:08 We will use interpolation with the table provided to determine the local mean time (LMT) of the end of evening civil twilight (ECT) at latitude 68°N on October 19th. By observing the table, we can see that when the date is increased by 3 days, the LMT of ECT is decreased by 11 minutes. Using this information, we can calculate that when the date is increased by 2 days, the LMT of ECT is decreased by 7 minutes (11 x 2 / 3 = 7.333 ≈ 7). Therefore, the LMT of the end of ECT at latitude 68°N on October 19th is calculated as follows: 17:15 - 00:07 = 17:08 We will use the same logic to determine the local mean time (LMT) of the end of evening civil twilight (ECT) at latitude 66°N on October 19th. By observing the table, we can see that when the date is increased by 3 days, the LMT of ECT is decreased by 11 minutes. Using this information, we can calculate that when the date is increased by 2 days, the LMT of ECT is decreased by 7 minutes (11 x 2 / 3 = 7.333 ≈ 7). Therefore, the LMT of the end of ECT at latitude 66°N on October 19th is calculated as follows: 17:19 - 00:07 = 17:12 From the given information, we know that the LMT of the end of ECT at latitude 68°N on October 19th is 17:08 and at latitude 66°N on the same date is 17:12. To find the LMT of the end of ECT at latitude 67°16'N on the 19th of October, we will use interpolation: We can observe that when the latitude is increased by 2° or 120', the LMT of ECT is decreased by 4 minutes. Using this, we can calculate that when the latitude is increased by 16', the LMT of ECT is decreased by 0.533 minutes (4 x 16 / 120 = 0.533 ≈ 0.5 minutes or 30 seconds). Therefore, for 1º16' = 1 min 30 sec Therefore, the LMT of the end of ECT at latitude 67°16'N on October 19th is: 17:12 - 00:01:30 ≈ 17:10. Next, we will convert the LMT of the end of ECT at Bodo airport in Norway (N67° 16', E014° 22') on October 19th to UTC: Bodo airport is 14o 22' East off Greenwich, which corresponds to: 14º x 4 min + 22' x 4 sec = 57 minutes of time. Convert LMT into UTC: The Earth rotates from West to East, thus the UTC end of Evening Civil Twilight at Bodo airport on 19th October 2017 is: 17:10 - 00:57 = 16:13 UTC.",

Australia) [westerly direction], you gain one day, if you were 1st of January you will automatically find yourself second of January (you gain one day in your calendar). The opposite will happen if you're travelling eastwards. SUMMARY: Westerly - Add a day Easterly - Subtract a day In this case, we are crossing the International Date Line eastbound on the 10th of the month. Therefore, we will need to subtract a day (we will gain one day) and the date at the destination will be the 9th.",

It is a system based on the observation of the sun position in the sky. The sun appears to describe a 360º circle around the earth. For the observer the sun will change position 15º/h (360º/24h). LMTs difference = change longitude / 15 Local Mean Time is obtain determining at the local apparent noon at specific meridian. Local noon occurs at the same local time at all latitudes of the same meridian. Local Mean Time is inappropriate for use in a country as a standard time. Countries with cities with different longitudes, would have different LMT’s. Standard Time is the convention where clocks within a geographical region are synchronized to a single time standard. Each country defines its own Standard Time notified in the Air Almanac of its correction related to UTC. Each country tries to fix 1200 ST to occur at half period of light and 2400 ST to occur half of period of darkness. Universal Coordinated time (UTC) is the primary global standard time. To avoid confusions with different time zones and daylight saving time, UTC is the time used in aviation for air traffic control services, clearances, flight plans and weather forecast. It is often necessary convert LMT to UTC and vice-versa. Based on apparent movement of the sun from east to west: Longitude east, UTC is least Longitude west, UTC is best Summer Time / Daylight Saving Time is adopted in some countries within the summer months. Those are identified with an * in the Air Almanac. Summer Time is normally advanced 1 hour in advanced to Standard Time. With the Standard Time convention, within and geographical area the reference time will be the same even though the sun apparent movement of the sun. With the westerly movement of the sun it means that the sun will rise later in a westerly position: 50º / 15 = 3 h 20 min 07 h 29 min + 3 h 20 min = 10 h 49 min",

            "explanation": "Since the Earth rotates from West to East, the Sun rises in the East before it does in the West. Therefore, time to the East is ahead (later) of time to the West. When crossing the International Date Line, there is a shift in your calendar day. Traveling in a westerly direction, from the western hemisphere (e.g., Hawaii) to the eastern hemisphere (e.g., Japan), results in the acquisition of an additional day. For example, if the date is January 1st, you will find yourself on January 2nd upon completion of the crossing. Conversely, when journeying eastward, the inverse occurs, causing a loss of a day in your calendar. Circumnavigating the globe: Travelling westwards around the world, you should set your clock: Back by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and Forward by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line. Traveling eastward around the world, you should set your clock: Forward by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and Back by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line. SUMMARY: Westerly - Add a day, Clock Time 'decreses' Easterly - Subtract a day, Clock Time 'increases' In this case, we are travelling westwards. For every 15° of longitude crossed, the clock time goes one hour back, so clock time 'decreases' towards the destination. This means that the 12 hours time difference between departure and destination should be deducted from initial the clock time. We are also crossing the International Date Line westbound, so when crossing we should set our clock forward by 24 hours and the calendar date will go one day forward.",

            "explanation": "The lit area that the Sun creates upon the Earth changes every day because of the inclination of the Earth's rotational axis at 23.5º different to the axis of orbit around the Sun. The latitude of an observer and the date of the year makes the largest differences to the sunrise and sunset times (and therefore to the length of daylight). We can go through each option and evaluate each one. \"Sunrise and sunset times vary with the date because of the changing distance between the Earth and the Sun.\" Whilst if you dig very deep, this actually does become slightly correct (research the reason for the analemma if interested), the changing distance between the Earth and the Sun is NOT the primary reason that sunrise and sunset times change, and has a VERY small effect on this, so much so that the examiner may not have even considered it when making this one of the incorrect options. \"For a given latitude, on the 1st May, sunrise occurs earlier than on the 19th May.\" This is not always true for every latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, for some areas at the North Pole would have NO sunrise during these days, and the low latitude areas could actually have a slightly later sunrise on the 19th of May than the 1st, due to the Sun's azimuth travelling further North, away from them (however this is more difficult to observe in reality due to small effects like the analemma). \"Sunrise and sunset times vary with latitude because of the tilt of the Earth's spin axis.\" This is absolutely correct, as mentioned above. \"On the 31st of May, the Sun will set earlier at 60°N compared to a location at 30°N. \" To work this out, we must consider that the 60ºN latitude is quite close to the arctic circle, and the 31st of May is quite close to the 21st June, which is the Summer solstice, where anywhere North of around 66ºN will have continuous daylight. This means that at this latitude and date, the day will be very long, and the nighttime hours very short, therefore having a very early sunrise. At 30ºN though, the daylight hours do not change very much from Winter to Summer, so stay much closer to 12 hours Day and 12 hours Night, and therefore 30ºN would have a later sunrise. Incorrect.",

The closer you live to the North or South Pole, the longer the period of daylight in the summer. Thus, Daylight Saving Time (Summer Time) is usually not helpful in the tropics, and countries near the equator generally do not change their clocks. If daylight saving time or summer time is mentioned, then add one hour to the standard time in spring, so that darkness falls at a later clock time and subtract this additional in autumn to return to Standard Time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the autumn. Therefore, the effect of using Daylight Saving Time (DST) or Summer Time is that the daylight is shifted towards later in the day.",

            "explanation": "The Air Almanac includes tables that give the Local Mean Time (LMT) of sunrise and sunset and the LMT of the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening twilight. The times given in the Air Almanac are calculated for the Greenwich meridian, but can be taken as LMT at all longitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of the year. Higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter, because of the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. The morning civil twilight starts when the centre of the Sun is 6o below the sensible horizon and ends at sunrise. And the evening civil twilight starts at sunset and ends when the centre of the Sun is 6o below the sensible horizon. For this question: Find the LMT end of the Evening Civil Twilight on 12th October 2017 interpolating for N67° 16' (between N66° - N68° and between 11th - 14th Oct): 17:36. Convert Arc to Time: Bodo airport is 14o 22' East off Greenwich, which corresponds to: 14º x 4 min + 22' x 4 sec = 57 minutes of time. Convert LMT sunset into UTC: The Earth rotates from West to East, thus the UTC end of Evening Civil Twilight at Bodo airport on 12th October 2017 is: 17:36 - 57 min = 16:39 UTC. NOTE: Arc to time conversions: 360º = 24 hours, 15º = 1 hour, 1º = 4 minutes, 1' = 4 seconds.",
