An irritating and potentially dangerous situation in radiotelephony is a “stuck” microphone button. Operators should always ensure that the button is released after a transmission and the microphone placed in an appropriate place ensuring that it will not inadvertently be switched on. Should your microphone button be stuck in the \"transmit\" position, your radio will keep transmitting permanently, and since VHF communications are not telephone communications, nobody else will be able to talk on that particular frequency, although they will hear everything you say.",

            "explanation": "Controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC). A means of communication between controller and pilot, using data link for ATC communications. The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

When an aircraft is being vectored, the ATC has the responsibility to provide altitudes that ensure obstacle clearance. However, if the altitudes given by the ATC do not ensure the required ground clearance, the pilot should refuse to follow them. ICAO Doc 4444 - Air Traffic Management 8.6.5 Vectoring 8.6.5.2 When vectoring an IFR flight and when giving an IFR flight a direct routing which takes the aircraft off an ATS route, the controller shall issue clearances such that the prescribed obstacle clearance will exist at all times until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. When necessary, the relevant minimum vectoring altitude shall include a correction for low temperature effect. Note 1.— When an IFR flight is being vectored, the pilot may be unable to determine the aircraft’s exact position in respect to obstacles in this area and consequently the altitude which provides the required obstacle clearance. Detailed obstacle clearance criteria are contained in PANS-OPS (Doc 8168), Volumes I and II. See also 8.6.8.2. ICAO Doc 8168 - Aircraft Operations 1.3.4 Vectors Pilots should not accept vectors during departure unless: a) they are above the minimum altitude(s)/height(s) required to maintain obstacle clearance in the event of engine failure. This relates to engine failure between V1 and minimum sector altitude or the end of the contingency procedure as appropriate; or b) the departure route is non-critical with respect to obstacle clearance.",

As mentioned in the learning objective above, occasionally, it is useful for ATC to request that an aircraft changes its call sign in order to provide adequate difference with an aircraft of similar call sign, or to avoid confusion when referring to any other things such as locations or procedures, which might sound the same as a call sign. In this case, the two aircraft have very similar callsigns, only separated by \"Tango\" vs \"Bravo\", which are both similar sounding words. In this case, much confusion could be had when conversing with those aircraft, and it is therefore best to ask one to change their call sign. It is usually up to the controller to choose a different call sign, and in this case, they could change \"AT139\" to \"Helicopter 139\", for instance. The messages to change (and then later on revert) call sign from the controller would be: CHANGE YOUR CALL SIGN TO (new call sign) [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED] REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALL SIGN (call sign) [AT (significant point)]",

ICAO Doc 10037 Global Operational Data Link (GOLD) Manual 1.2.3. CPDLC connection management 1.2.3.1.1. The purpose of a CPDLC connection is to allow the exchange of CPDLC messages between an aircraft and an ATS unit (active connection), and also to provide an advance connection with the next ATS unit (inactive connection). An aircraft can have a maximum of two CPDLC connections established concurrently, each with a different ATS unit. Only one CPDLC connection can be active at any given time; any second connection is inactive. 1.2.3.3.2. The ATS unit initiates a CPDLC connection by sending a CPDLC connection request to the aircraft as 1.2.3.3.3. Provided there is no existing CPDLC connection, the aircraft system: a) accepts the connection request; b) establishes this CPDLC connection as the active connection; and c) responds with a CPDLC connection confirm. 1.2.3.5. Transferring CPDLC connections 1.2.3.5.1. Under normal circumstances, the CDA will initiate a CPDLC transfer to an adjacent ATS unit as the aircraft transits from the current ATS unit to another CPDLC-capable ATS unit. These transfers are normally automatic, without flight crew action. “Disconnected from LOVV. Connecting to LOVL”: This transmission indicates that the aircraft's CPDLC system has autonomously managed the transition between the CPDLC ground stations. LOVV refers to the control center that the aircraft was previously connected to, and LOVL is the new control center it has connected to. This automatic handover is a standard process in CPDLC to maintain continuous communication as the aircraft moves through different airspace sectors.",

Note.— The abbreviated term “ADS contract” is commonly used to refer to ADS event contract, ADS demand contract, ADS periodic contract or an emergency mode. The ADS (Automatic Dependent Surveillance) is a FANS application that consists in automatically sending aircraft surveillance data to the ATC. The set of data to downlink is defined automatically, without any crew action. The different types of ADS contracts can be: Periodic – at periodic time intervals. On demand – when asked for by the ATC. On event – whenever a specified event occurs. Emergency messages can also be sent through the ADS application. When a MAYDAY datalink message is sent to the ATC, the ADS contract is switched to a high periodic reporting rate.",

In this question, the crew need to collect the weather information for a number of airports in order to decide on a diversion option. The clue in the question is 'the quickest way to obtain weather information'. Calling several airports on the radio to ask for individual weather reports would take time and is normally not practical. ATC at major airports would not have the time to issue such reports. Selecting ATIS is an option but it would take time to individually collect the reports for several airports, and there is the question of being in range to receive the signal.

If a discrete frequency is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel(s) of the most appropriate terminal navigation aid(s), preferably a VOR, provided the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the navigation aid is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated. ICAO Annex 3 11.6.1 Continuous VOLMET broadcasts, normally on very high frequencies (VHF), shall contain current METAR and SPECI, together with trend forecasts where available. 11.6.2 Scheduled VOLMET broadcasts, normally on high frequencies (HF), shall contain current METAR and SPECI, together with trend forecasts where available and, where so determined by regional air navigation agreement, TAF and SIGMET.

Looking at each answer. 'D-ATIS' --> INCORRECT. The aircraft does not have data link. 'VOLMET - VHF' --> INCORRECT. VHF may not be available on an oceanic flight due to range limitations. 'VOLMET - HF' --> CORRECT. A VOLMET broadcast provides current METAR, SPECI, TAF and SIGMET information by means of continuous and repetitive voice broadcasts. HF would be an appropriate source in mid ocean. 'Request from ATC via voice communication' --> INCORRECT. Obtaining the weather for several airports would be impracticable via voice communications. There is also the question of range limitations on VHF due to being an oceanic flight. ICAO Annex 3 11.6.1 Continuous VOLMET broadcasts, normally on very high frequencies (VHF), shall contain current METAR and SPECI, together with trend forecasts where available. 11.6.2 Scheduled VOLMET broadcasts, normally on high frequencies (HF), shall contain current METAR and SPECI, together with trend forecasts where available and, where so determined by regional air navigation agreement, TAF and SIGMET.",

Therefore, we should attempt to make contact on an alternative suitable frequency. These can be found on en-route charts, and if those are not available or cannot be contacted, then 121.5 MHz can be used to establish comms and ask for a suitable frequency based on your position. If you do happen to have recently changed over to the frequency, in the last couple of minutes for instance, then it might be worth enquiring on your previous frequency about alternative frequencies to use.| Therefore, a few of these options are partially correct as part of working out an alternative frequency to use, but the only fully correct answer is to \"find an alternative frequency.\"",

There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

Once ATC is aware of the situation, they will coordinate with relevant authorities, including search and rescue services and ground-based emergency personnel, to respond to the incident. Ground-based emergency services, such as Police, Fire Departments, and Forest Fire Protection, will be notified by ATC or other relevant authorities about the crash and the location. They will then respond to the incident to provide assistance and carry out necessary rescue and recovery operations. The emergency frequency is used by any official personnel who are helping the aircraft, so the answer \"Police, ATC and Forest Fire Protection\" is chosen as the correct one.

This is a bit tricky, the flight is not in grave danger but someone onboard is and that person may require immediate medical assistance upon landing (this is not explicit in the question text). If you were to ask me, I would declare PAN PAN. For following reasons: - I will get a priority over all other traffic, except for aircraft in distress (rightfully so) - Mayday would start opening options I won't use (opening of closed runways and airports, etc.). While medical emergency on board, the safety of the flight shall not be put in a jeopardy. We need priority, but not at the cost of safety, normal landing will be performed. - Mayday will trigger emergency protocols at airports, preparing for crash landing (EHAM, highway closures), which we don't need. - What we need is to land at nearest suitable airport without delay, taxi to a stand (close to the runway) and get medics in for the passenger.

So, the higher above sea level the antenna is, the greater range the VHF device will have. Attenuation is the term given to the loss of signal strength in a radio wave as it travels outward from the transmitter. It limits the range of radio signals. Higher frequencies suffer from higher attenuation – because they have a higher number of peaks which causes a higher number of energy fluctuations and energy loss over distance, being more prone to attenuation.",

The electromagnetic wave has two components - the electrical field (E) occuring in the vertical plane and the magnetic field (H) oscillations in the horizontal plane. The electric and magnetic fields oscillate at 90° with one another and the direction of propagation. Polarisation is affected by the plane of the aerial - a signal will only be effectively received if the receiving antenna is in the same alignment as the transmitting antenna: For efficient reception, if the transmitting antenna is vertical, the receiving aerial should also be vertical. If the transmitting aerial is horizontal, the receiving aerial should also be horizontal. A difference in polarity between the transmitter and the receiver reduces quality of reception.",
