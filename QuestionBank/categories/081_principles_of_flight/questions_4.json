Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "TRAILING EDGE FLAPS Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and when low airspeeds are beneficial. This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. Returning the flaps to their neutral position when no longer required, returns the wing to its former aerodynamic characteristics. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. USE OF TRAILING EDGE FLAPS FOR TAKE-OFF For take-off purposes, the flaps are normally lowered to a position that provides the best lift-drag ratio that can be obtained with the flaps in any position other than fully up. Since the required lift is obtained at a lower airspeed, the take-off run is also reduced. Larger amounts of flap cause a significant increase in drag, which greatly reduces the acceleration and increases the take-off run. The reduced stalling angle of attack and increased drag associated with flaps also reduces the rate and angle of climb. After take-off, a minimum climb gradient is required in the take-off configuration. Climb gradient is reduced by flap, so if climb gradient is limiting, a lesser flap angle may be selected even though it gives a longer take-off distance.",

LIFT/DRAG RATIO For any given mass and altitude, level flight can be maintained at any speed, between the maximum and minimum limits, by adjusting the angle of attack to keep the lift formula in balance, to ensure the lift developed is equal to the mass. As the angle of attack increases so does the induced drag, this increases the total drag. To counteract the increased total drag a greater amount of thrust is required. This will increase the fuel consumption and is clearly an inefficient way to maintain level flight. The most efficient manner in which to fly an aeroplane is with an angle of attack that creates the greatest amount of lift whilst causing the least amount of drag. The most efficient angle of attack is that which produces the highest lift/drag ratio. This angle of attack is the same for all masses and altitudes and is usually 4º. The EAS at which this occurs is the most economical cruise EAS and varies in direct proportion to the gross mass of the aeroplane. THE EFFECT OF FLAPS Although lift increases with greater flap angles so also does drag, but to a much greater extent, particularly at angles of attack above that which produces the best lift/drag ratio. Lowering flaps usually decreases the lift/drag ratio and, although it is possible to fly at a lower speed, the thrust required increases. Selecting the largest flap angle causes the greatest negative influence on the lift/drag ratio.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Next, knowing that the total pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure, we know that if one increases, the other must decrease to maintain a constant total pressure. Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! Therefore, going back to the question, we can say that the point of minimum static pressure is the point of maximum dynamic pressure (airflow velocity). Therefore the point of minimum static pressure will be somewhere on the top of a positively cambered aerofoil. This would most commonly be at the point of maximum camber, but not always! Changes in angle of attack will move the point of maximum velocity forwards and backwards, therefore the most correct answer is where streamlines are closest together.",

Slotted flap (and multiple slotted flaps) - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. It has a lower CL/CD compared to more advanced designs. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high CL/CD ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft. Here's the order from the lowest to the highest CL/CD ratio: (3) Split flap ⇒ (1) Plain flap ⇒ (2) Slotted flap ⇒ (4) Fowler flap.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag FORM DRAG Form (pressure) drag results from the pressure at the leading edge of a body being greater than the pressure at the trailing edge. Skin friction, along with the adverse pressure gradient behind the transition will cause a reduction in kinetic energy of the boundary layer. Separation will occur when the boundary layer does not have sufficient kinetic energy in the presence of a given adverse pressure gradient. Because of separation, there will be a lower pressure at the trailing edge than the leading edge. An aerodynamic force will act in the direction of the lower pressure - form drag. When a shock wave forms on the upper surface, the increase of static pressure through the shock wave will create an extreme adverse pressure gradient. If the shock wave is sufficiently strong, separation will occur immediately behind the shock wave.",

Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and when low airspeeds are beneficial. This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. USE OF TRAILING EDGE FLAPS FOR TAKE-OFF For take-off purposes, the flaps are normally lowered to a position that provides the best lift-drag ratio that can be obtained with the flaps in any position other than fully up. Since the required lift is obtained at a lower airspeed, the take-off run is also reduced. Larger amounts of flap cause a significant increase in drag, which greatly reduces the acceleration and increases the take-off run. The reduced stalling angle of attack and increased drag associated with flaps also reduces the rate and angle of climb.",

At the wing tip, however, there can be no pressure difference, and the pressure is equalized by air flowing around the wing tip from the higher pressure on the lower surface to the lower pressure on the upper surface. There is therefore a span-wise pressure gradient, i.e., pressure changing along the wing span. One of the primary factors which determine the magnitude of the vortices is the angle of attack. For a given speed, the wing lift, and thus the magnitude of the tip vortices, increases with the angle of attack. Slow, heavy, clean\" are the three major conditions generating stronger wing vortices. Extending the flaps increases the coefficient of lift (CL), which means that for a given speed, a lower angle of attack will be required, which reduces the wing tip vortices strength. “Stronger with a high aspect ratio” and “Not related to aspect ratio”.

This helps you visualise the scenario, but in reality, even that knowledge is not required. If an aerofoil is not producing any lift, then it is not producing any lift-induced drag, which is a by-product of lift. As it is at subsonic speeds, then no shockwaves have been formed (that would be transonic or supersonic), and therefore no wave drag is produced. The aerofoil is moving through the air, so does produce skin friction drag, form (pressure) drag and interference drag. These are all constituent parts of \"parasite drag\".",

They can extend symmetrically or asymmetrically. If spoilers on both sides are used, its primary purpose is to reduce the speed at which the aircraft is travelling. Spoilers can also be used in a turn to assist the ailerons. In this case, the spoiler mounted on the down-going wing will come up, reducing lift for that wing even more and therefore assisting the ailerons. The spoiler on the up-moving wing will remain stowed. For example, if the aircraft wants to enter a right turn, it will have to bank to the right. The right wing will have to come down and the left wing will have to rise. The aileron on the left will come down, producing more lift on the left wing and the aileron on the right will come up. The spoiler mounted on the upper side of the right wing will also come up, reducing lift of the right wing even more. This way the aircraft reaches its desired bank angle easier at low speeds.",

Learning Objective 081.01.09.01.09: Explain the effects of flap-setting errors, such as mis-selection and premature/late extension or retraction of flaps, on: take-off and landing distance and speeds; climb and descent performance; stall buffet margins. This scenario is effectively asking what happens if we land with less flaps. Well of course, with less flaps, our stall speed will be higher, as flaps increase the camber (and sometimes area) of the wing, allowing an aircraft to fly slower with the same amount of lift. With a higher stall speed, the approach speed VREF will be higher, the aircraft will touch down with more groundspeed, causing a longer landing distance than if a higher flap setting were to be used. So that is (1) and (4) answered, and we must remember that with a lower flap setting we have less lift available for the same IAS. This is the component that influences our landing distance, as the lack of lift means we have to fly at a higher speed, and land at a higher speed. As for the drag, lower flap settings produce less drag. This is not the main factor behind the increased landing distance though, as most of the braking action during landing comes from the brakes (and reverse thrust, if available), and the flaps actually reduce the weight of the aircraft on the wheels, so reduce braking ability slightly.",

Now when considering the pressure, we know that the total pressure always remains constant in subsonic airflow. Next, knowing that the total pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure, we know that if one increases, the other must decrease to maintain a constant total pressure. Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! What this means for our question is that: Converging streamlines indicate a speed increase Diverging streamlines indicated a speed decrease A decrease in static pressure occurs with an increasing speed And an increase in static pressure occurs with a decreasing speed",

This has nothing to do with induced drag. 2) Propeller slipstream over the wing. – Incorrect The slipstream from a propeller will cause a couple effects, such as yaw, and torque, but it will have no effect on induced drag. 3) Aerodynamic interaction between aeroplane parts. – Incorrect The drag because of aerodynamic interaction between aeroplane parts is known as interfrerence drag, and has nothing to do with induced drag. 4) Downwash generated by tip vortices. – Correct Firstly, one could simply deduce the correct answer through cancelling out the incorrect answer. Secondly, we know that induced drag is a secondary effect of lift. Wing tip vortices are a result of the upwash and downwash effect near the tip of the wings, which produces a rearward component of lift knows as induced drag. Therefore this is the correct answer.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Boundary Layer Skin friction drag is a function of the layer of air closest to the surface. As air flows over a wing, the roughness of the surface and the viscous property of the air itself slow it down. Much like fluids, the more viscous the air, the greater its retardation. At the surface, the air particles adhere to it and their relative velocity is reduced to zero (figure 1). Just above the surface, the air particles slow down due to the friction effects between the particles, but except for the layer in contact with the surface, the particles do not completely come to rest. The relative velocity of the air particles increases steadily with distance from the surface, until reaching a point where the particles do not slow up at all and instead travel at the free stream velocity. The boundary layer is the layer of air between the surface and the free stream velocity in which local retardation takes place. Like the main airflow, the boundary layer flow can be either laminar or turbulent in nature (figure 2). Skin Friction Drag Skin friction is the reaction to the retardation of the airflow within the boundary layer. The retarded air tries to drag the surface along with the flow, in much the same way as two solid surfaces sliding over each other do. Known as shear stress, this is directly proportional to the speed of flow. Figure 3 represents the shear stress patterns that exist between layers. The gradual velocity change associated with the laminar boundary layer shows that low shear stresses exist near the surface, resulting in low skin friction drag. Conversely, the rapid velocity change associated with the turbulent boundary layer is evidence of high skin friction drag.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. The high wing aircraft will still experience ground effect, but because the wing is several feet farther from the runway, the total effect on the aircraft is greatly reduced, as ground effect decreases exponentially with difference from the runway surface. Thus, a high wing on take-off is the configuration with the least reduction in lift.",

Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

However, the thrust may have to be increased to overcome the increased drag, even though when deployed they decrease the magnitude of the wing-tip vortices. Not only does the extension of trailing-edge flaps decrease the critical angle of attack it also increases the CLMAX, increases the total lift generated, increases the total drag, unfavorably affects the lift/drag ratio and decreases the stalling speed no matter what the altitude or mass of the airplane. Unlike slats, trailing-edge flaps increase lift at all angles of attack up to the stall. Thus, if the angle of attack remains constant during flap extension the airplane will begin to climb. All trailing-edge flaps when lowered, increase the acceleration of the airflow over the upper surface of the wing, which reduces the pressure above the wing and increases the upwash over the leading edge. Together these influences generate an increased nose-down pitching moment because of the altered pressure distribution around the flaps and the aft movement of the wing CP.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example: when it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warming that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Let’s say we have a tube with steady low subsonic flow. Halfway through this pipe we have a heating element that heats up the air, this will decrease the density of the airflow. So that means we have less mass flow right? Well no because mass flow will naturally always keep itself constant, therefore if the density of the air decreases without any change in cross section area, the velocity will increase. This is because the mass flow on the entry side of the tube will always be the same as the mass flow on the exit side of the tube, even if the air is warmer/colder.

Starting from the thickest aerofoil, B has a large amount of positive camber and high thickness with a flat base, looking a little bit like the aerofoil on a STOL aircraft (short take-off and landing). This leads us to believe that it has the highest CLMAX and therefore is line 3. Also, the fact that it produces a positive amount of lift at 0 degrees AoA fits with that aerofoil best. To the other end of the spectrum, aerofoil C is very thin, still with a mostly flat base, and very little camber, so little that it is almost symmetrical. It therefore fits line 1 best on the graph, producing the least amount of lift overall. It looks more like a high speed aerofoil (but the stall characteristics appear very favourable on the graph which looks a little unrealistic for such a thin leading edge). Therefore, aerofoil A which lies directly between B and C in terms of shape and size will also lie in between them on the CL vs AoA graph, so is equivalent to line 2.

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Learning Objective 081.01.10.01.02: Describe the effect of spoilers on the CL-alpha graph and stall speed. Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). In this case though, the graph given in the question removes all uncertainty, and an increase in critical AoA is the only possible correct answer. Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here.",

CL can be altered in flight, for example, by lowering the flaps. When a flap is deflected downwards, the camber of the airfoil increases, the coefficient of lift (CL) increases, resulting in higher lift production.

In simple terms, when the flaps are deployed, CL increases (CL higher than 0.28), but to keep the lift balanced and the altitude constant, the aircraft slows down (V decreases).

Each flap setting has a VFE speed, which is the maximum flaps extended speed. Above this speed, the flaps will take too much load, and could be damaged. Modern jet transport aircraft often have a flap load relief system, which detects flap overspeed, and can disengage the flap lock, allowing the airflow to push the flaps to a lower setting, or some intermediate value, so that the flaps do not get damaged. Some systems use hydraulic pressure and physically move the flaps using the standard system, whereas others use the \"blowback\" system mentioned above.",

Therefore 850/1013 x ρ = 0.84 ρ is approximate density at 6000 ft. As a result, drag will be 84% of the drag at MSL: 785 N x 0.84 = 659 N (Closest option available is 656 N)",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: The parasite drag from the extended flap results in a degraded climb angle and climb gradient. In this case, for a take-off using 15º of flaps compared to a clean take-off (flaps retracted), the take-off speeds will be reduced, which results in a reduced take-off run. For fully retracted flaps, the take-off speeds will increase, meaning that the aircraft may remain on the ground after rotation.",

In most cases, speedbrakes are panels (most frequently on the upper surface of the wing, but sometimes mounted on the fuselage top side or left/right side near the tail) which, when selected by the pilot, extend into the airstream to produce drag. Their operating principle is simple. Cross-sectional area increases, the air becomes turbulent in the space directly behind them, which increases parasite drag. The wing-mounted versions of speedbrakes also dump some lift and thereby increase induced drag also as the wing has to fly at a higher angle of attack (though not all speed brakes are of this type, so it is not the correct answer). Since drag increases and lift reduces, lift to drag ratio reduces significantly.",

            "explanation": "Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Thus, a low wing aircraft on landing will produce the least amount of Induced Drag.

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. The induced angle of attack increases.",

The equation of continuity can now be simplified to: A x V = Constant ⇒ V ≈ 1/A Because the mass flow must remain constant, it can be seen from the equation of continuity that the reduction in the tube’s cross-sectional area results in an increase in velocity, and vice versa.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50% The increase in stall speed due to ice formation is not easy to quantify, as the accumulation and shape of the iceformation is impossible to predict.

This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. The shape of an airfoil has a huge impact on the induced drag of an aircraft assuming the same weight and speed. This question is asking for the effect of: Lift distribution: An elliptical lift distribution generates less induced drag than a rectangular lift distribution. This is because the lift distribution of a rectangular wing creates a larger force near the tip. Even though the elliptical wing creates a larger coefficient of lift at the tip, the subsequently smaller wing area near the tip means that barely any force of lift is created there any therefore leads to a smaller vortex and less induced drag. Therefore statement 1 is correct! Aspect ratio: Induced drag is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio. Therefore, induced drag increases with decreasing aspect ratio, and, induced drag decreases with increasing aspect ratio. Therefore statement 2 is incorrect!",

This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. Downwash angle: Increasing the effect of the vortices will increase downwash angle. Induced angle of attack: The increase in downwash will cause the induced angle of attack to increase leading to a increase in induced drag.",

The pressure distribution around an aerofoil is the resultant of the angle of the aerofoil chordline to the oncoming airflow, the angle of attack. If a symmetrical aerofoil section is in a steady airstream at zero degrees Angle of Attack, a stagnation point forms on the leading edge. The airflow velocity above and below the aerofoil increases by an equal amount and the static pressures reduce by an equal amount. Consequently, no pressure differential exists, and no net lift is created. CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and when low airspeeds are beneficial. This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. Returning the flaps to their neutral position when no longer required, returns the wing to its former aerodynamic characteristics. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edgeflaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. LEADING EDGE DEVICES Leading edge devices increase maximum value of CL and critical angle of attack. But for the constant angle of attack CL is the same or less.

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag (and induced drag coefficient) decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. The induced angle of attack increases.",

To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. INDUCED DRAG vs. AIRSPEED The Effect of Airspeed relates to the changes in induced drag with the variation of airspeed. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds and high angles of attack (i.e. during take-off and landing, when it can account for approximately three-quarters of the total drag). To maintain steady level flight, as the airspeed decreases and the angle of attack increases, the slower passage of air rearward over the wing increases the spanwise flow of air around the wing tip. This results in larger wing tip vortices and greater induced drag.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum DragSpeed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. PARASITE DRAG If an aircraft were flying at zero lift angle of attack, the only drag present would be parasite drag. FORM DRAG Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow.

            "explanation": "Note: There are quite a few factors which affect an aircraft's landing performance and handling. The question and available options do not take into account these different factors. That is to say that the examiner has been very closed minded in writing this question, using a \"tunnel vision\" approach. The current correct option is simply the only answer that makes any sense. It is the \"most correct\" out of a bad bunch, and in itself is arguable, but depending on the circumstances we have not been told, may be true, whereas the other answers are not true in any circumstance. For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the wing’s effective camber and the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase, therefore Reducing the length of the landing roll. Therefore, the answer here is that using less flaps than expected will cause significantly less drag than expected, so the aircraft may float for a while longer, and therefore have a longer landing roll (that is assuming that the pilot rotates enough during the flare, which has not been specified in the question). As mentioned above, none of the other answers could be correct: There will be a large difference to the handling characteristics, even if the attitude remains the same. There is arguably a higher risk of a hard landing due to the lower \"cushioning\" effect of the lower flap setting. This one takes longer to explain but most pilots know it naturally from experience. A go-around is very much advised if you realise the flaps are incorrectly set at a low altitude where this cannot be fixed.",

This is useful mostly to allow the aircraft to take-off and land in shorter distances, as it can allow the aircraft to fly slower. Secondarily, they are useful for increasing drag, but that is not the purpose of this question. Extending trailing edge flaps allows for a higher camber of wing, and improves the lift coefficient of the wing, so it can produce enough lift at lower speeds than a clean wing, hence the lower stall speeds. As for the centre of pressure, this is the location where all the combined aerodynamic pressure effects act through, and this is based heavily off the pressure distribution around the main wing. The flaps change the pressure distribution a lot, and this causes the overall centre of pressure to move aft when flaps are extended.",

Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. A wing with a higher aspect ratio has a lower value for CLMAX and will have a higher value of CL for a certain angle of attack.",

            "explanation": "When density altitude increases, the air gets \"thinner\", meaning that there are less air particles per cubic metre, and therefore less air particles will hit our aircraft and flow over its wings per mile flown. This would decrease lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but climb higher in the atmosphere, the lower air density means that we have to fly faster to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is an increase in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with increased altitude (ignoring compressibility at very high altitudes). As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with an increase in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the right, due to the increased TAS for the same IAS at higher altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 3, moving to the right.",

When you're landing, you typically extend your flaps close to maximum setting. By putting the flaps out all the way, you maximize the lift and drag that your wing produces. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: • Producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed (due to the slower stall speed). • Producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. • Reducing the length of the landing roll. In this case, for a clean configuration (in comparasion to a full flap configuration): - Drag is reduced; - Speed at threshold is greater; and - Landing distance is increased.",

Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! Going back to the question, we can say that the point of minimum static pressure is the point of maximum dynamic pressure (airflow velocity). Therefore the point of minimum static pressure will be somewhere on the top of a positively cambered aerofoil.",

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. It is important to note that in level flight, the lift force equals weight, and therefore lift does not change just by extending flaps. All that will change is how slow we can fly and still gain that same lift force (stall speed). We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), so increase the drag force.",

            "explanation": "Terminology definition angle of attack: angle between the chord line and the relative (undisturbed) air flow. Local airflow = downwash at the trailing edge of the airfoil for example. Angle of attack (AOA, α - Greek letter alpha) is a term used in aerodynamics to describe the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion between the airfoil and the air through which it is moving. For a two-dimensional airfoil, angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the direction of arrival of the incoming air. In aviation, angle of attack is used to describe the angle between the chord line of the (three dimensional) wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. The angle of attack is often confused with the pitch angle of an aircraft and the angle of incidence. Pitch angle and angle of incidence are measured from the same reference line as angle of attack (conceptually the chord line), but pitch refers to the horizon and angle of incidence to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. Whereas, the angle of attack is measured from the (same) reference line to the direction of the arrival of the air to the wing (caused by the relative motion between the wing and the atmosphere). Note: Some tricky questions ask about the angle of attack of the aeroplane (not the wing) => angle between speed vector and longitudinal axis.",

            "explanation": "Note: This appears to be a scenario based version of an older question, number 818975. When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan, the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, can experience up to a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in downforce on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determines the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any give angle of attack. Any devices that reduce induced drag will cause ground effect to be less effective, as the induced drag is already lowered. Winglets (or fitting bigger winglets) on an aircraft reduce the size and strength of wingtip vortices, and therefore reduce the induced drag in all stages of flight. Therefore, aircraft A with bigger winglets will not feel as much of a reduction in induced drag during ground effect, therefore the ground effect will be decreased on aircraft A. To put it simply, winglets and ground effect do the same job, and ground effect cannot do as much when (bigger) winglets are already fitted.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Angle of attack: The induced drag is proportional to the angle of attack. Therefore, induced drag increases as the angle of attack increases, and, induced drag decreases and the angle of attack decreases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. This is achieve by increasing the angle of attack. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. A wing with a higher aspect ratio has a lower value for CLMAX and will have a higher value of CL for a certain angle of attack.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but EASA have published questions like this one where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). In this case though, the graph given in the question removes all uncertainty, and the only answer is that the graph follows the “B” direction, down and to the right. Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here.",

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 is a significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0º AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber. We can assume from the question text that the other lines represent different configurations of the same aerofoil, so our answer is symmetrical aerofoil with leading edge flaps extended.",

Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct!

Speed stability simply means a disturbance to the sped will return back to the equilibrium, whilst speed instability is the opposite. As the aircraft is situated in the speed unstable region, a sudden decrease in speed will cause the total drag to increase, whilst the thrust remains the same. A thrust deficit will be created.

            "explanation": "Note: This question appears to have different answers with different authorities. We think that the question has no correct answer in its current form. Please send us any exam feedback you have about this question so we can get it as representative as possible of the question in the exam quickly, thank you! As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct. Authority Reported Answer Latvia C (maintained its direction.) Poland Not C Austro Not C Spain A (greater than 10°.) Portugal A (greater than 10°.) We would say if your country is \"Not C\", go for A \"greater than 10 degrees\". A wing creates a force from the air flowing over it, and the direction and magnitude of that \"resultant force\" change based on the speed of the airflow, density of the air, and angle of attack (AoA) of the wing. This resultant force is split into two forces we know very well. Lift and Drag. Lift is the component of the resultant force that acts at 90º to the relative airflow (dictated by the speed and direction of the air approaching the wing - not yet affected by the presence of the wing or the aircraft), whereas drag is the force parallel to the relative airflow. This is the basics of \"2D airflow\", but gets a bit more complicated when we include \"3D airflow\", the existence of induced drag, wingtip vortices, etc. When flying at higher angles of attack, the effects of wingtip vortices introduce upwash ahead of the wing and downwash behind it, and this changes the \"effective\" angle of attack, which is the angle of air as it hits the wing, and is approaching from higher up than the relative airflow. The \"effective lift vector\" is at 90º to this \"effective\" angle of attack. Because this \"effective\" lift vector points slightly backwards, some of this \"effective lift\" is turned into drag. We call that \"induced drag\". The angle of \"tilt\" of the effective lift vector is the same angle that our angle of attack changes by (from actual AoA to effective AoA), and this angle of attack that we \"lose\" is called the induced angle of attack. This is particularly useful knowledge for questions about ground effect. Now to look at this question. When the aircraft slows down and increases its angle of attack to remain straight and level, the actual lift vector (90º to the relative airflow - so directly upwards) must stay the same direction and magnitude, to counteract the weight of the aircraft. The increase in AoA causes an increase in the strength of the wingtip vortices, and therefore the upwash ahead of the wing, thus increasing the induced AoA (the angle of attack that is lost). This means that the \"effective lift vector\" of the wings tilts back somewhat and increases in magnitude (to keep the actual lift constant), creating more induced drag. This \"angle of tilt\" (the induced AoA) is much less than the change in total AoA of 10º. Using normal wings, it would be in the region of 3º change. Therefore, the \"effective lift vector\" would tilt back by around 3º (less than 10º) and increase in magnitude, due to the larger induced AoA. Now that actually doesn't leave us with a correct answer. That is because none of the answers are correct. Even with a question that can be interpreted 2 ways, there is still no correct answer. If you take the question as literally as possible, then the actual lift vector (vertical) does not change in direction or magnitude, remaining vertical and equal to the weight force (option D is therefore wrong due to the magnitude). If you take the question to mean the \"effective lift vector\", then the correct answer would be \"changed direction by a value smaller than 10°, with the lift vector pointing more rearwards because of a larger induced AOA.\". None of the other answers fit this. Answer C says that it stays in the same direction with relation to the chord line, meaning that the effective lift vector moves by 10°, the same as the AoA change, which is not correct.",

            "explanation": "Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: Parasite Drag - independent of lift generation, and Induced Drag - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG is simply caused by the aircraft's shape, construction-type, and material. For instance, an airplane with a rough surface creates more parasite drag than one with a smooth surface. And there are three basic types of parasite drag: 1. Skin Friction Drag is the result of the aircraft's surface being rough. Olympic swimmers wear swim caps on their heads, so hair doesn't create extra drag and they can swim faster through the water => this same principle can be applied to most aircraft, where a smooth skin reduces skin friction drag, improving performance and fuel efficiency. 2. Form Drag is the result of an object's general shape in relation to the relative wind. Resulting from the pressure at the leading edge of a body being greater than the pressure at the trailing edge. 3. Interference Drag is generated by the mixing of airflow streamlines between airframe components such as the wing and the fuselage or the landing gear strut and the fuselage. As air flows around different aircraft components and mixes, a localized shock wave is formed, creating a drag sum greater than the drag that components would have by themselves. Factors Affecting Parasite Drag: Indicated Airspeed - It varies directly with the square of the Indicated Airspeed. If IAS is doubled, the Parasite Drag will be four times greater - if IAS is halved, the Parasite Drag will be one quarter of its previous value. Configuration - Parasite Drag varies directly in proportion to the frontal area presented to the airflow. If flaps are deployed, the undercarriage lowered, speed brakes selected or roll control spoilers operated, \"Parasite Area\" is increased and Parasite Drag will increase. Airframe Contamination - Contamination by ice, frost, snow, mud, dust or slush will increase the Parasite Drag Coefficient, and in the case of severe airframe icing, the Parasite Area.",

Increasing the angle of attack causes the stagnation point to shift downward, leading to more air moving upward over the upper side of the wing and advancing the location of the lowest static pressure point. Consequently, at a specific angle of attack, this airflow triggers the stall warning, emitting an audible alert in the cockpit. The lowest pressure point resides along the upper surface of the wing and shifts in tandem with the Center of Pressure (CP) in response to changes in the Angle of Attack (AoA): an increase in AoA moves the CP forward, while a decrease moves it aft.",

So an aircraft with a Lift to Drag ratio of 10/1 is producing 10 times more lift than it is producing drag. The lift to drag ratio depends on the angle of attack. The angle of attack of a clean wing decides its lift coefficient, and its drag coefficient, then you can compare those two to get the lift/drag ratio. In reality, the lift is often much higher than the drag, so the L/D ratio is usually over 1. If an aircraft could fly fast enough to run at a very low (or negative) angle of attack, then its lift produced (which will equal its weight in straight and level flight) could be less than the drag (and therefore thrust - if the aircraft is at a constant speed). It is a bit of a crazy notion for civilian pilots, as the aircraft would have to have a higher thrust than its own weight, but this is quite common in fighter jets, especially modern jets or VTOL jets. We can see that by the fact that they can accelerate vertically upwards.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

(1) Plain Flap: The rear portion of the wing aerofoil rotates downwards on a simple hinge arrangement mounted at the front of the flap. Provides good increase in CLMAX, but with fairly high drag. (2) Slotted Flap: Similar to a Plain Flap but incorporates a gap between the flap and the wing to force high pressure air from below the wing over the upper surface of the flap. This helps reduce boundary layer separation and allows the airflow over the flap to remain laminar. The slotted flap gives a bigger increase in CLMAX than the plain or split flap and much less drag. (3) Fowler Flap: A split flap that slides rearwards level for a distance prior to hinging downwards. It thereby first increases chord (and wing surface area) and then increases camber. The Fowler flap gives the greatest increase in lift of the flaps considered and also gives the least drag because of the slot and the reduction of thickness",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Ice will lead to sooner separation, smaller stalling angle of attack, therefore causing a lower CLMAX. Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions. The ice changes the airfoil cross section and destroys lift, increases drag and raises the stalling speed.",

Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, increase CL values for all angles of attack, also increasing drag, and not changing the stalling angle of attack very much (small increases or decreases are possible depending on the specifics). Slats do not increase CL for normal values of AoA, instead, they just delay the stalling AoA, allowing for a higher CLMAX due to the higher critical AoA. This is what is being shown in the graph. Kreuger flaps tend to sit somewhere in the middle of the two other devices on the graph, but are obviously very ineffective at low angles of attack.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The difference in lift will cause a rolling moment which must be opposed by the ailerons, and the difference in drag will cause a yawing moment which must be opposed by the rudder.

Take a look at the Cirrus SR-22 examples in the attached figure. Notice the difference in wingtip vortex size at altitude, vs. near the ground? When your wing is close to the ground, wingtip vortices can't get as big, because as they spin around your wingtip, they impact the ground and dissipate. The result? A reduction in downwash. Less downwash, less drag. Summary: Flying low to the ground limits your vortices, making them smaller. This means that the air flowing off the back of your wing has less downwash. Ground effect is definitely experienced within half a wingspan. In this question, the wingspan equals 20 m which equals approximately 60 ft (65 ft to be exact).",

The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant.

            "explanation": "High-lift devices are incredibly important for the operation of aircraft. Particularly for large commercial jet aircraft, the use of flaps and slats is essential to allow acceptable take-off distances and land with reasonable speeds. They are incredibly powerful, which causes a massive problem if the flaps operate differently from each other, which we call flap/slat asymmetry. This is possible for many reasons, but a common one is if a flap extension/retraction system jams, the two flap settings will become different from each other. Flap asymmetry is worse than slat asymmetry. Flaps provide a large increase in coefficient of lift and in drag for the same angle of attack as a clean wing, whereas slats increase drag slightly, but delay the stall greatly, allowing the aircraft to fly at a much higher angle of attack. Therefore, a flap asymmetry will cause a large rolling moment away from the extend flaps. and a strong yaw towards the side of the extended flaps. Therefore, to counteract this as pilots, we must roll towards the extended side, and yaw away from the extended side. On this flap indicator, our right-hand flaps are at flap 15 extension, so must have jammed, and our left-hand flaps are retracting through flap 5/flap 2. We must therefore roll to the right and yaw to the left to maintain straight and level flight. This is a flap display off the Boeing 737 and actually indicates the location of flaps and slats, if you know the order of flap extension/retraction, but the examiner wants to keep things simple by saying it is only trailing-edge flaps.",

Air directly in contact with the surface of the aeroplane will be dragged along at a slightly lower speed than that of the aeroplane because of the inherent cohesion of the air. The air further away from the surface of the aeroplane will be pulled along but at a lower speed than the surface air. This dragging effect decreases with increasing depth of the layer of air until at a particular depth the movement of the aeroplane does not affect the air at all. The depth of the layer of air from the aeroplane surface to the depth at which the air is unaffected is the boundary layer. The value of surface-friction drag varies and is determined by: - the total surface area of the aeroplane; - the coefficient of the air viscosity; - the rate of change of flow speed over the depth of the boundary layer. FLOW TRANSITION The nearer the transition point is to the leading edge of an aerofoil the greater is the amount of surface friction. The location of the transition point from laminar flow to turbulent flow is dependent on four factors: - surface condition; - speed of flow; - size of the object; - adverse pressure gradient. SURFACE CONDITION The depth of the boundary layer, both laminar and turbulent, increase with distance from the leading edge of an aerofoil. A rough, dirty, wet, or ice-covered surface will increase the depth of this layer causing greater interference with the airflow over the aerofoil. Polishing the aerofoil surface minimises the effect of this type of drag.",

Tapered wings are structurally very strong, as the wing root is a lot bigger, allowing for a stronger connection to the fuselage, and the wing gradually gets thinner towards the wingtip where less reinforcement is required. There are some aerodynamic benefits to tapered wings as well, which includes a small reduction in induced drag, due to the majority of the lift coming from the wing closer to the root. One of the problems with a tapered wing is the stall handling. On a rectangular wing, the stall begins at the back near the root, whereas on a tapered wing, the stall will begin near the tip instead, which leads to the aileron area becoming stalled, and losing aileron (roll) control (see first annex above). The taper of a wing is measured by the taper ratio, which is simply Taper ratio = tip chord / root chord So if the taper ratio is 0.5, the wingtip is half as wide as the root. Any number less than 1 indicates that the wing is tapered. 1 means the chord stays the same along the whole wingspan, more than 1 would be a wing that gets wider.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50% The increase in stall speed due to ice formation is not easy to quantify, as the accumulation and shape of the ice formation is impossible to predict. Ice or frost must never be allowed to remain on any aerodynamic surfaces in flight, nor must ice, frost, snow or other contamination be allowed to remain on the aircraft immediately before flight.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. Another characteristic associated with ground effect is the change in aircraft trim and stability. This occurs because the surface deflects the downwash acting behind the wing, thus altering the angle at which the airflow meets the tail plane This places the tail plane at a less negative, or increased angle of attack, and reduces the download acting on the tail plane. In this condition, the aircraft experiences a nose-down pitching moment (figure 2). A high T tailed aircraft do not respond in this manner since the tail plane is outside the influence of the downwash.",

Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct!

            "explanation": "Terminology definition angle of attack: angle between the chord line and the relative (undisturbed) air flow.

Angle of attack (AOA, α - Greek letter alpha) is a term used in aerodynamics to describe the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion between the airfoil and the air through which it is moving. For a two-dimensional airfoil, angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the direction of arrival of the incoming air. In aviation, angle of attack is used to describe the angle between the chord line of the (three dimensional) wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. The angle of attack is often confused with the pitch angle of an aircraft and the angle of incidence. Pitch angle and angle of incidence are measured from the same reference line as angle of attack (conceptually the chord line), but pitch refers to the horizon and angle of incidence to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. Whereas, the angle of attack is measured from the (same) reference line to the direction of the arrival of the air to the wing (caused by the relative motion between the wing and the atmosphere). Note: Some tricky questions ask about the angle of attack of the aeroplane (not the wing) => angle between speed vector and longitudinal axis.",

It is created by the vortices at the tip of an aircraft's wing. The magnitude of induced drag depends on the amount of lift being generated by the wing and on the shape and size of the wing. Induced drag can be reduced by: Using a high aspect ratio wing planform => Wings with high aspect ratio have lower induced drag than wings with low aspect ratio for the same wing area. So wings with a long span and a short chord have lower induced drag than wings with a short span and a long chord. Using a tapered wing planform with wing twist and/or spanwise camber variation, or incorporation of wing end plates, tip tanks, winglets or various wing tip shapes. Note: Winglets are small vertical aerofoils which form part of the wing tip; they reduce tip vortex intensity, thus reduce induced drag - this is their only function.",

Energy has to be used to provide this temperature rise across the shock wave and this energy loss is drag on the aircraft – Energy Drag.

Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

With increasing altitude, pressure continues to fall. This causes density to reduce with increasing altitude. IAS is a measurement of dynamic pressure. Dynamic pressure = 1/2 p V2, where V equals TAS. With a decreasing density (p) and constant TAS, IAS decreases. Now let's take a look at the lift formula: L = 1/2 p V2 S CL A decrease in IAS, with all remaining variables being the same would result in a decrease in lift.

Within the boundary layer, the laminar layer is the thinnest and generates the least friction. However, as this laminar layer progresses toward the transition point, it transitions into the turbulent layer. This turbulent layer is thicker and contributes to higher friction drag. To enhance aerodynamic performance, certain aerofoils are engineered to delay this transition, allowing it to occur further downstream. This strategy increases the extent of laminar flow, reducing overall friction drag. For instance, vortex generators may be used to extend the laminar flow by energizing the boundary layer and creating turbulent flow, which does cause more drag indeed, but that's how separation is delayed which is actually more important when you look at the big picture. Vortex generators are located on the upper surface of a wing to create a slightly disturbed airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing. The higher energy level delays the boundary layer separation (resulting in an extended laminar flow section), which reduces the stall speed.",

It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic.",

It represents the maximum speed where no part of the wing goes supersonic, especially where airflow accelerates most over the wing's upper surface. This acceleration is linked to the wing's curvature, or camber. When the angle of attack (AoA) increases, airflow over the wing's upper surface speeds up even more. Thus, a higher angle of attack leads to a lower MCRIT because sonic speed is reached at a slower flying speed. Imagine two planes flying at the same constant speed at level flight (n = 1), one heavier than the other. The heavier plane needs increase its angle of attack to generate enough lift to stay up because it's heavier. As the angle of attack increases, the air above the heavier plane's wing speeds up more, even though both planes are flying at the same IAS. The heavier one would hit the speed of sound over its wings before the lighter one, even if they had the same IAS. This happens because the heavier plane needs to have a higher angle of attack to stay at the same speed, which means it's already pushing the air faster over its wings. Thus, owing to the increased angle of attack needed to sustain flight at a given IAS, the heavier aircraft demonstrates a lower MCRIT compared to the lighter one.",

            "explanation": "During high-speed flight, significant changes occur in the flow and pressure distributions around the aircraft, which result in a loss of lift and an increase in drag. This is caused by the formation of shock waves, which adversely affect the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. As stated above, the Local Speed of Sound (LSS) is solely dependent on the Air Temperature. After the shockwave, the temperature increases and, therefore, the LSS also increases.",

With increasing Mach number, however, it will vary as At high altitude, a large high-speed jet transport aircraft will be cruising at a speed marginally above its critical Mach number, and it will have a small shock wave on the wing. If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’ because it results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. Shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value (for a given angle of attack).",

            "explanation": "Mach trim is used to trim the aircraft at high Mach numbers (e.g. B737 from Mach.615). It prevents instability and tuck under (which appears above MCRIT) due to an increased pitch down moment, which is caused the following reasons: CP moves aft shock waves at the wing root reduced effectiveness of the tailplane Mach trim counteracts (increases pitch up) by one of the following: adjusting stabilizer adjusting elevator trim tank (fuel pumped to the tail) Outcome: stick force gradient will be maintained longitudinal stability will be increased tuck under will be avoided Mach Trim System relates to the pitch channel of the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS). It is designed as an AFCS sub-system and is therefore, like the yaw damper, operational irrespective of whether or not the AFCS is active (autopilot engaged or disengaged). The heart of the Mach trim system is the coupler unit. This receives signals, corresponding to Mach number, from the Air Data Computer (ADC). Whenever these signals exceed the pre-set value (for the aeroplane type) the trim coupler unit releases the brake and the speed signal from the ADC is fed to the motor. This causes the stabiliser to move in such a way that the elevators are driven upward, counteracting any tendency to a \"Mach Tuck-under\". Internal monitoring of the system provides a failure warning in the form of the illumination of a fail indicator light. Although connected to the pitch channel the system is totally independent of the pitch control channel of the AFCS. In other words, the Mach trim system provides speed stability at higher Mach numbers. It operates (adjusts the elevators with respect to the stabilizer as speed increases) only above certain minimum Mach number - for example on a B737-300 it is above Mach 0.615. With the Mach trim system INOP the maximum speed of the aircraft is typically limited to a lower Mach number than normally. \"Tuck-under\" is the phenomena encountered by aeroplanes flying at high subsonic, transonic or supersonic speeds. In these speed regimes there is typically a significant rearward movement of the Centre of Pressure (CP). In order to prevent this becoming an uncontrollable \"nose-down\" pitching motion, it is necessary to provide some form of compensation. This is done by the use of a Mach Trim System. Or otherwise said the Mach trim system allows to increase the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft by changing the horizontal stabilizer according to the Mach number.",

It occurs well before reaching Mach 1 speed. Mach tuck can be caused by two things; a rearward movement of the center op pressure (CP) and a decrease in wing downwash at the tailplane. Both of these conditions cause a pitch down effect, as they generate a (bigger) positive moment aft of the CG. When the airflow around the airfoil starts reaching supersonic speed (this can happen before the aircraft flies at Mach 1 speed), small shockwave forms over the upper side of the wing, generating a large amount of lift. If speed increases, this shockwave will move backwards to the mid chord position, causing the CP to move backwards. The adjusted flow over the wings can reduce downwash on the tailplane, contributing to Mach tuck.",

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

For the example shown, the maximum effective deflection of the elevator is not capable of trimming the airplane at CLMAX for CG positions ahead of 18 percent MAC. This control requirement can be most critical for an airplane in supersonic flight. Supersonic flight is usually accompanied by large increases in static longitudinal stability (due to aft CP movement) and a reduction in the effectiveness of control surfaces. To cope with these trends, powerful all-moving surfaces must be used to attain limit load factor or maximum usable CL in supersonic flight. This requirement is so important that once satisfied, the supersonic configuration usually has sufficient longitudinal control power for all other conditions of flight. Note: When supersonic flight is being discussed, both the aerodynamic center (AC) and the center of pressure (CP) of a wing tend to shift towards the midpoint of the wing, which is typically around 50% of the chord.",

In this question, the pilot is flying at a constant calibrated airspeed (CAS) of 308 knots and is then asked by ATC to increase the rate of climb. The pilot transitions to a constant Mach number (M 0.72) and, in order to do so, adjusts the aircraft's pitch attitude. Initially, the aircraft pitches up to maintain the constant Mach number, its calibrated airspeed (CAS) reduces. This reduction in CAS leads to a decrease in kinetic energy (associated with forward speed). However, the potential energy (associated with altitude) increases due to the upward climb. This shift from kinetic to potential energy contributes to the increased rate of climb, all while adhering to the requested constant Mach number.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

Please send further feedback if you see this in the exam, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. The differences between conventional (low mounted) horizontal stabilisers and T-Tail (high mounted) horizontal stabilisers are many. Other than the increased efficiencies of the T-Tail, one of the primary differences is that it is not in the wake of the main wing during normal flight. They can be in the wake of the main wing at the stall though, causing a potentially unrecoverable deep stall. At normal flying speeds, the pitch angle of the aircraft to maintain level flight is such that the T-Tail is far above the wake of the main wing, so when in the transonic speed range, the reducing downwash of the main wing will not really affect the tailplane, as it would do a conventional tailplane. So for this question, we believe that the downwash will not change by a noticeable amount, and there will be little to no buffet on the horizontal stabiliser, due to its distance from the wake of the man wing. We must remember that the main wing is the first place on the aircraft that forms a shockwave, so the separation will cause the main wing to have a turbulent wake. This is what we believe the examiner is asking about, not when the tailplane itself forms a shockwave.",

            "explanation": "An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. Thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Deflecting a control surface upward decreases camber, this will arrest the aft movement of the shockwave (or, in fact, move it slightly forward) due to the increase in MCRIT.",

High-speed aerofoil sections are typically thin and sharp, while slow-speed designs have rounder leading edges and more camber. The attached graph compares a typical high-speed section with a general-purpose low-speed aerofoil. To generate the necessary lift in their respective speed regimes, these two aerofoils have different CL (coefficient of lift) requirements. The low-speed aerofoil is designed with greater thickness and camber to achieve a higher CL, enabling it to produce sufficient lift at lower speeds. Conversely, the high-speed aerofoil is much thinner and less cambered, resulting in a smaller CL. However, this reduced CL is compensated by the higher IAS (indicated airspeed) at which the high-speed aerofoil usually operates. A high speed aerofoil: Tens to have less camber, so the CL/Alpha line is below that fo a slow speed aerofoil. Tends to be thinner, so the critical angle is significantly smaller. The thinner aerofoil also has a significantly lower CLMAX.",

The Mach number is defined as the ratio between the TAS and the LSS (Local speed of sound): M = TAS ÷ LSS The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. Effect on Mach Number of Climbing at a Constant IAS: - Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound will decrease as altitude is increased. - If altitude is increased at a constant IAS, the TAS increases. - Therefore, the Mach number will increase if altitude is increased at a constant IAS. This is because TAS gets bigger and LSS gets smaller. As the climb continues, an altitude will be reached at which the flight crew must stop flying at a constant IAS and fly at a constant Mach number, to avoid accidentally exceeding MMO.",

Aircraft certified under CS-25 (and some aircraft under CS-23) are given maximum flight speeds as a VMO and MMO (maximum operating airspeed/Mach No.). Depending on the altitude and air temperature, one of these will correspond to a lower airspeed than the other. That one will be the most limiting. The MMO is most limiting at high altitudes, which is when it is most useful for us to refer to our speed in Mach No., whereas at lower altitudes, the VMO is most limiting, and we should use IAS/CAS instead. The point where this crossover happens is called the crossover altitude. A common altitude for this is around 28000 ft, but it depends on the aircraft and conditions. If descending at a constant mach number, the Mach number will not exceed the MMO (as it is constant), but using the ECTM graph above, we can see that the IAS will be increasing, and therefore the IAS may well reach and exceed VMO if the crossover is delayed to a lower altitude. The other two options \"shock stall speed\" and \"never exceed speed\" can be discounted here, as aircraft with VMO/MMO do not have a VNE and the shock stall speed occurs based on the Mach No. and MMO, both of which we know remain constant (and it is not a limiting speed as such).",

In the constant IAS phase of the climb, density (rho) is decreasing and V is increasing which maintains dynamic pressure at a constant. Therefore, there is no change in CL.

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

Flow separation occurs because the boundary layer loses kinetic energy as it flows against the adverse pressure gradient. Shock wave formation increases the adverse pressure gradient so the loss of kinetic energy in the boundary layer will be greater. Increasing the kinetic energy of the boundary layer will reduce flow separation. Simple devices called vortex generators are used to re-energize the boundary layer. Vortex generators are small plates, vanes, blades, or wedges mounted in spanwise rows along the wing surface. Each vortex generator produces a vortex at its tip which will induce high energy air from the free stream flow to mix with the boundary layer, thus increasing its kinetic energy and helping it flow through the shock wave with much less separation. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. It should be noted that vortex generators may also be used on subsonic aircraft to prevent separation caused by high adverse pressure gradients due to the contours of the surface.",

This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. Above MCRIT, the air flowing over the top of the wing becomes supersonic, and at the point at which the air wants to decelerate back below Mach 1.0, a shockwave is formed. This shockwaves is a very thin surface where the characteristics of the air change dramatically, and can cause some airflow separation, leading to an effect called the shock stall. There are many ways to delay MCRIT and the shock stall, one of which is to fly with a supercritical wing. A supercritical aerofoil has a much flatter top surface, which not only increases MCRIT and MDD (drag divergence)* but also creates a weaker shockwave when one is formed, just above MCRIT. The shockwaves on a supercritical aerofoil quickly move to the trailing edge, making the shock stall a much smaller effect. For civilian applications, the main benefit is the faster speed that can be flown, before drag increases due to wave drag. The higher MCRIT/MDD and ability to fly just above MCRIT with little extra drag is very useful for long range jet aeroplanes, for extra range, speed and ability to fly at higher altitudes. *MDD (drag divergence Mach number) is a speed which comes just above MCRIT, where the drag begins to increase rapidly with increase in speed. This is what we really want to make higher, and using a supercritical aerofoil does exactly that.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. In supersonic flight, the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag, which occurs due to the formation of shockwaves at certain critical points on the aircraft's surface. A thinner wing with a smaller leading edge radius will produce smaller shockwaves and thus less wave drag.",

The intensity of a shock wave will, consequently, increase with the increased angle of attack. This happens due to higher velocities over the profile.",

Thin aerofoils will generate less acceleration over the upper surface, so Mcrit will occur at higher speeds. There are various ways to increase the critical Mach number MCRIT. All of them involve doing something to change the flow on the upper surface. For example: Decrease the leading edge radius, which slows the air down. Decrease the thickness to chord ratio, which slows the air down. Sweep back, which effectively reduces the thickness to chord ratio, as far as the air molecules are concerned, so slows the air down. Vortex generators, which bring in air from outside the boundary layer delaying the onset of the critical Mach number and pushing the shockwave formation further back. Supercritical wing, which has a flatter upper surface so the air is not accelerated so much and pushes the shockwave formation further back. As far as the first example, decreasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thinner, less rounded leading edge, which reduces the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT increases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given lower acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a higher aircraft speed.",

If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’ because it results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. In the transonic range, the ‘shock stall’ is the separation of the boundary layer from the upper surface of the wing behind a shockwave. This causes the total lift generated to decrease. Unlike the normal high-incidence angle stall, the ‘shock stall’ occurs at low angles of attack and at an unexpectedly high IAS. For swept-wing airplanes because the wing-tips stall first the airplane has a nose-up pitch tendency. The angle of attack of the high-speed shock stall decreases as the Mach number increases and CLMAX decreases in a similar manner. Because the turbulent airflow behind a shockwave results in an increased loss of lift, any large rapid increase of speed can induce a premature stall.",

These effects cause the boundary layer above the wing to be very easily disturbed, inducing flow separation behind the shockwave. This separated airflow does not produce lift and this leads to the \"shock stall\" effect that can occur at these transonic speeds. As can be seen on the diagram above, initially the shockwave and boundary layer separation occur on the upper surface of the wing, approximately half-way along, then move backwards as the speed increases. A smaller shockwave also occurs on the underside of the wing near the trailing edge at slightly higher speeds, also moving towards the trailing edge as the aircraft accelerates further. Therefore, the best option here is on the upper surface, just ahead of the trailing edge. We are sceptical about that last bit of wording, but it is certainly the only possibly correct option in our opinion.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

Together, these factors will generate a nose-down pitching moment. At high Mach numbers, an aircraft will become unstable with respect to speed; instead of an increasing push force being required as speed increases, a pull force becomes necessary to prevent the aircraft accelerating further. A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment. This unfavourable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted. It is operational at high Mach numbers in the transonic speed range. In the event of this equipment failing, the speed is limited to specified Mach number.",

The first two zones are the troposphere and the stratosphere. The troposphere runs from the surface of the Earth to 36,152 feet. In the troposphere, the temperature decreases linearly with altitude at a constant rate of -1,98°C/1000 ft. The lower portion of the stratosphere is an isothermal layer where the temperature remains constant (approximately -57°C) with increasing height, and then in its upper layers the temperature increases to around 0° C at the stratopause. For the study of high speed flight we are interested in the speed at which the infinitesimally small pressure disturbances (waves) travel through the atmosphere. Pressure waves ‘propagate’ from their source, that is, each air molecule is rapidly vibrated in turn and passes on the disturbance to its neighbour. The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. The higher the temperature, the higher the speed of propagation. Therefore only possible answer can be LSS will decrease in the troposphere. Since temperature decreases with increasing altitude in the troposphere LSS would decrease with temperature as well.",

As the SAT increases, the air molecules become less dense, resulting in a higher TAS for a given CAS. Therefore, in the given scenario, where the temperature SAT increases from -35°C to -30°C, the TAS will also increase. The Mach number (M) is the ratio of the true airspeed (TAS) to the local speed of sound (LSS), and it’s a measure of compressibility.

            "explanation": "When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required as part of creating lift. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, for instance, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. A large factor of the MCRIT is the thickness of the aerofoil, as thicker aerofoils \"squash\" the air above the wing more, thereby speeding it up more. Therefore, thinner aerofoils are more suited to high speed flight, as they have a higher MCRIT, and also handle the transonic speed regime better in general. For this question, then, thicker aerofoils decrease the MCRIT (which is bad), and thinner aerofoils increase MCRIT (good).",

Part of the airflow is below sonic speed; another part is over sonic speed. Supersonic flow: 1.2 < M ≤ 5 In this region the airflow is over sonic speed everywhere about the aircraft.

            "explanation": "An airplane flying at low, subsonic, speeds causes air-pressure changes because of its movement but they are relatively small. It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic. The Local Speed of Sound is defined by: LSS=38.95∗√(T(K)) The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. Thus, if behind a shock wave temperature increases, the LSS also increases.",

            "explanation": "EFFECTS OF SHOCKWAVE FORMATION The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. FLYING CONTROLS The deflection of a conventional hinged-flap type of control creates a force ahead of the control surface that is normally greater than that which the control surface itself produces. When there is a shockwave established on the lifting surface ahead of the control surface this is no longer the case because pressure variations cannot be transmitted forward through the shockwave. The shockwave moves slightly aft when an aileron is deflected downwards. This effectively diminishes the result of deflecting the control surface because only the airflow passing over the control surface is modified. This effect is exacerbated when the shockwave reaches the trailing edge of the aerofoil and the control effectiveness is decreased even further. In transonic flight the ailerons are less effective than in subsonic flight because aileron deflection only partially affects the pressure distribution around the wing. These characteristics have led to the substitution of the tailplane and elevator combination in high-speed aeroplanes with a fully flying horizontal stabiliser. On these aeroplanes the conventional wing-tip ailerons are replaced with differential spoilers and/or inboard ailerons that are for use when the aeroplane is flying at transonic speeds. Because of the increased input forces required from the pilot during flight at transonic speeds and the large variation of the stick forces encountered during the transition of the shockwave over the control surface, most high-speed aeroplanes are fitted with fully power-operated controls.",

This is caused by the formation of shock waves, which adversely affect the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular (90 degrees), or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced.",

Students have confirmed that the option \"The airflow becomes more turbulent due to the presence of areas of Increased compressibility slowing down the speed of the airflow.\" Was not correct in exams. Please let us know if you come across this question in your examination. Thank you! As an aircraft accelerates to high speeds, it enters a regime where the effects of compressibility become significant. The critical Mach number (MCRIT) is the airspeed at which the local airflow over certain parts of the aircraft (typically near the wing's leading edge or other protuberances) reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1). The airflow over the aircraft's surfaces starts to approach or reach the speed of sound. This means that some parts of the aircraft may experience local airflow velocities at or near Mach 1. This increased compressibility is what leads to changes in the behavior of the airflow. As the airflow reaches or exceeds Mach 1 locally, shock waves can start to form. These are sudden, discontinuous changes in air pressure and density. Shock waves can form on the wings, fuselage, and other parts of the aircraft that have particular shapes or characteristics that cause local acceleration of the airflow. One of the consequences of compressibility effects is that the total pressure of the airflow increases. This increase in total pressure can lead to an artificially high reading on instruments like the airspeed indicator. CAS measures the pressure differential between the pitot tube (which senses ram air pressure) and static pressure. At high speeds, the ram air pressure component becomes significant, causing CAS to read higher than TAS.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

            "explanation": "The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON LIFT At low subsonic speeds the lift coefficient CL is assumed to be constant at a given angle of attack. With increasing Mach number, however, it will vary. At speeds above MCRIT a shock wave will have formed on the upper surface. This may cause boundary layer separation aft of the shock wave, causing loss of lift. Shock stall results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. Shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value (for a given angle of attack). EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON THE LIFT CURVE AND CLMAX At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4, CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 1. At a constant angle of attack, the increase of CL as speed increases from about M 0.4 into the low end of the transonic region gives a steeper lift curve slope, i.e. the change of CL per degree angle of attack will increase, as seen in figure 2. Because of earlier separation resulting from the formation of the shock wave, CLMAX and the stalling angle will be reduced.",

In aircraft which are not designed for these high speeds, that can be dangerous, as the shockwave can cause airflow separation and loss of lift behind it. However, modern high speed jet aircraft are designed with this in mind, with swept back, supercritical wings, etc. These allow the aircraft to operate just above MCRIT, with a small penalty of increased drag, in return for extra speed. This means that these aircraft often cruise with a very small shockwave on top of the wing. Whilst they stay below the Drag Divergence Number, the drag is not increasing too much and it is worth it for the extra speed.",

Because of the critical Mach number, it is possible that shockwaves can occur at speeds even below Mach 1. As the aircraft speeds up beyond this critical Mach number, drag increases dramatically. If the aircraft is not designed for transonic or supersonic flight, this could lead to controllability problems. The critical Mach number increases with increasing wing sweepback. Thinner airfoils also increase the value of MCRIT. The critical Mach number decreases with increasing Angle of Attack. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag on an airfoil begins to increase rapidly as the Mach number increases. The drag coefficient can multiply to 10 times its size compared to its low speed value. The drag divergence Mach number is a number bigger than Mcrit and smaller than Mach 1. The drag divergence Mach number can be increased by increasing wing sweepback.",

The easiest way to understand this is by remembering that the aircraft produces pressure waves ahead of it (its wings in this context) which \"tell the air that the wing is coming\", so the air can begin to move out of the way. These pressure waves can only move at the speed of sound though, so as the aircraft itself starts going faster, the air gets less and less time to move away from the oncoming wing. This leads to a more aggressive uplift of air just ahead of the wing leading edge at high subsonic speeds, and this takes some energy out of the airflow (amongst some other effects). Together, these lead to a stall at lower angles of attack than usual. Therefore, when accelerating into the transonic regime, the wing's critical angle of attack (angle at which it stalls) reduces due to the compressibility effects ahead of the wing.",

This will provide better flight characteristics and lower drag in the transonic speed regime where large jets often operate. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the freestream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. This agrees with what we would expect as cos(0) = 1 and therefore the perpendicular airflow to the wing is the same as the freestream airflow when no sweep angle exists (i.e. an unswept wing) The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

Swept wings can be very useful for high speed flight, as the effectively lengthen the chord of the wing, so therefore decrease the thickness-to-chord ratio, effectively making the wing behave like a thinner wing and having a higher MCRIT. Swept wings do pay for this in other areas though, such as low speed flight, where they have a tendency to stall at the tips first, as well as lower lift for the same angle of attack, and less effective high lift devices. High lift devices are less effective on swept wings, take trailing edge flaps for example, simply because the hinge line is not perpendicular to the airflow, and this puts the flaps at an angle, which decreases their effectiveness. The steeper the sweep angle, the stronger this effect. Therefore, the worst wing type from these options is the one with the greatest sweepback of 25°.",

When entering the transonic speed range, the Center of Pressure (CP) moves backward, causing a pitch down moment. To counteract this, the aircraft should apply a pitch up moment to the elevator or stabilizer. When exiting this range and returning to subsonic speed, the opposite should be done by applying a pitch down input to the elevator or stabilizer.",

For best specific range (nautical miles per kg of fuel used) we need maximum TAS / Drag ratio. TAS can be maximised without a significant drag penalty, if we fly just above MCRIT. This is because, when Mcrit is first exceeded, the extra drag caused by the shock waves will be minimal, (especially on supercritical wings), provided that speed is kept below the drag divergence Mach number. The TAS / Drag ratio also increases, if TAS can be increased without an increase in IAS. This can be achieved by increasing altitude.

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less.

The area rule states that provided the cross-sectional area of the aeroplane is similar to that of the ideal shape, the wave drag of the aeroplane will be similar to that of the ideal shape, irrespective of its actual shape. Wave drag is related to the curvature of the distribution of the volume of an aeroplane. The smoother the curvature the less is the magnitude of the wave drag. Large volumes of the airframe, such as the wings, are usually positioned at the widest part of the fuselage and other necessary features such as the cockpit, the tailplane and engine intakes have to be spread out along the fuselage to maintain the cross-sectional area distribution as near perfect as possible. For transonic aeroplanes it was discovered that indenting the fuselage to produce a waist and adding more volume to the rear of the aeroplane minimised transonic wave drag. Thus, the volume of the fuselage has to be decreased wherever a projection such as the wings and tailplane are positioned so that the cross-sectional area distribution changes smoothly with no discontinuities. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘coke bottle’ effect.",

            ],
            "explanation": "As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Figure 1 shows that at low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 2. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2∗W)/(ρ∗S∗CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 3 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

Longitudinal stability is the most commonly affected form of stability. It is determined by movement of the centre of pressure, coupled with changes in the coefficient of lift and the amount of downwash acting on the tailplane. The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under. The exact nature and strength of the changes in trim and stability depend on the design of the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "081.02.03.01.02: Explain how a change in alpha, aeroplane weight, manoeuvres, and centre-of-gravity (CG) position influences MCRIT. When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. The higher the angle of attack of the wing, the higher the speed increase, and therefore the lower the MCRIT. This would come from anything that increases the angle of attack, such as higher weight, or a more forward CG, which acts like increased weight due to the increased downforce from the tailplane. Effectively, bad things for performance such as increased weight or forward CG, cause a bad effect, lower MCRIT, due to increased AoA. Therefore, in this question, the more aft CG will cause a reduction in lift required by the main wing, which will require a lower angle of attack (lower lift coefficient for level flight), and the speed increase over the wing would be lower, so the aircraft can fly faster before getting shockwaves forming, thus a higher MCRIT, which is good.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

            ],
            "explanation": "LOW SPEED VS. HIGH SPEED STREAMLINE (figure 1) As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. EFFECT OF MACH NUMBER ON CLMAX (figure2) This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2 x W)/(ρ x S x CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. STALLING SPEED vs. ALTITUDE (figure 3) At a constant EAS, Mach number increases as altitude increases. The variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

However, airliners fly very close to their critical Mach number, consequently compressibility cannot be neglected anymore. In fluid mechanics, compressibility is the change of density of a fluid in response to a change in pressure (or mean stress). At supersonic speeds, streamlines do not avoid the body in front of it, as the speed of the profile is higher than the speed of the disturbance. Compressibility can also be considered as density change along a streamline",

Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Coefficient of Lift (CL) is assumed to remain constant for a particular angle of attack at low subsonic speeds. In high subsonic speeds and the transonic speed regime, the compressibility of the air begins to take effect and, for a particular angle of attack, the coefficient of lift increases. This is because the air cannot \"feel the wing coming\" from as far away (due to it moving so fast), so has to react and get out of the way later. This is more aggressive and gains more lift from the air, but it also removes some of the energy from the air by doing this, and causes a much lower stalling angle of attack, and thereby decreases the CLMAX of the wing overall. This reduced stalling angle of attack is also what causes the low speed buffet boundary to get faster at high altitudes.",

Liquid is an incompressible fluid. A gaseous fluid such as air, on the other hand, can be either compressible or incompressible. Generally, for theoretical and experimental purposes, gases are assumed to be incompressible when they are moving at low speeds (under approximately M0.4). The motion of the object traveling through the air at such speed does not affect the density of the air. This assumption has been useful in aerodynamics when studying the behavior of air in relation to airfoils and other objects moving through the air at slower speeds. However, when aircraft began traveling faster than M0.4, assumptions regarding the air through which they flew that were true at slower speeds were no longer valid. At high speeds some of the energy of the quickly moving aircraft goes into compressing the fluid (the air) and changing its density. The air at higher altitudes where these aircraft fly also has lower density than air nearer to the Earth's surface. The airflow is now compressible, and aerodynamic theories have had to reflect this.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less.",

This is caused by the formation of shock waves, which adversely affect the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. In fluid dynamics, the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number that describes the relative pressures throughout a flow. The increase in pressure due to the compressibility effects created by the presence of shockwaves will lead to an increase in the pressure coefficient.",

            "explanation": "CRITICAL MACH NUMBER Critical Mach Number (MCRIT): The critical Mach number is the Mach number of the aircraft when the speed of the airflow over some part of the aircraft (usually the point of maximum thickness on the aerofoil) first reaches the speed of sound. An aerofoil generates lift by accelerating air over the top surface. At small angles of attack the highest local velocity on an aircraft will usually be located at the point of maximum thickness on the wing. At increased angles of attack the local velocity will be greater and further forward. Also, if the thickness/chord ratio were greater, the local speed will be higher. Increased thickness/chord ratio and increased angle of attack cause greater accelerations over the top surface of the wing, so the Critical Mach number will decrease with increasing thickness/chord ratio or angle of attack. If we consider two aeroplanes maintaining a constant flight level and flying at the same IAS, one heavier and one lighter, the heavier aeroplane will be flying at a greater AoA in order to maintain a constant flight level. As mentioned above, a higher AofA leads to a higher airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface for the heavier aeroplane, even though both are flying at the same speed. If both aeroplanes accelerate at the same rate, the heavier aeroplane would be the first to get into a situation where the airflow over the upper surface of its wings would locally reach a sonic speed. Therefore, at the same speed, the heavier aeroplane has a lower MCRIT due to the higher AoA. In conclusion: Higher mass = lower MCRIT due to a greater AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed. Lower mass = higher MCRIT due to a smaller AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed.",

            "explanation": "Exceeding the MCRIT speed means that the aircraft is in the transonic speed regime, and that the air going over the wing is becoming supersonic, and therefore forming a shockwave as it reduces back below supersonic speeds. The formation of the shockwave over the wing is the main focus of this question. Transonic effects do cause changes in elevator (pitch) controls due to Mach tuck, but the largest control surface change is the ailerons, as they are mounted on the main wings, and can interact quite badly with the shockwave formation. When ailerons deflect downwards, they change the camber of the wing and cause further acceleration over the wing, which increases the magnitude of the shockwave. The shockwave causes shockwave induced separation behind it on the wing, and this greatly reduces the effect that ailerons can have, as they are trailing edge devices. The worst effect occurs when the section of the wing in front of the ailerons does not yet have a shockwave, so just above MCRIT, when the wing root has formed a shockwave but the thinner section near the wing tip has not. The down-going aileron can increase the camber enough to cause an isolated shockwave in that area, and this can massively reduce the lift from that section of the wing. Of course, that is the exact opposite of the desired effect, as that wing is supposed to be the one with more lift. Therefore, you get a aileron reversal effect, where you ask the aircraft to roll left but it actually rolls to the right. As for the other options: Spoilers are affected by shockwave formation, of course, but as they tend to accelerate the air over them, the shockwave would form right at the back of the spoiler, so they would have at least mostly the desired effect. The rudder is not massively affected by shockwave effects as the fin is very thin in comparison to the wing, and therefore doesn't accelerate the air as much, so shockwaves form much later, and quite evenly on either side of the fin. Flaps should not be used at transonic speeds, for so many reasons.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

As speed increases above MCRIT shock waves begin to form and drag increases more rapidly than it would have done without the shock waves. The additional drag is called wave drag and is due to energy drag and boundary layer separation. The change in drag characteristics is shown by the CD curve for a basic section at a constant angle of attack in figure 1. The ‘hump’ in the curve from M 0.89 to M 1.2 is caused by: The drag directly associated with the trailing edge shock waves (energy loss). Separation of the boundary layer. The formation of the bow shock wave above M 1.0. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag begins to increase rapidly. This increase in drag can be seen in figure 1. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

Please let us know if you see this question in the exam, what the correct answer could have been (if you can find out) and which authority you sat the exam with, thank you! When an aircraft accelerates through the transonic speed range and exceeds its Critical Mach number, a normal shock wave can form on the upper surface of the wing. This shock wave induces flow separation, causing turbulent airflow over the wing and along the fuselage. This turbulent airflow can create airframe buffet, which is felt throughout the aircraft. If the tailplane is aligned with the separated airflow, the turbulent airflow caused by the flow separation can also hit the tail of the aircraft, which may result in a change in the aerodynamic forces acting on the tail and buffet. Option a) \"up wash over the tail, causing a nose down pitching moment.\" is not correct because the flow separation on the wing does not cause upwash over the tail, but rather turbulent airflow and a slight reduction in downwash (naturally, due to the higher airspeed). There will be a nose-down pitching moment around this time, but it is due to the AC moving on the wing and the reduction in downwash, not upwash from the shockwave.",

Longitudinal stability is the most commonly affected form of stability. It is determined by movement of the centre of pressure, coupled with changes in the coefficient of lift and the amount of downwash acting on the tailplane. The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under. The exact nature and strength of the changes in trim and stability depend on the design of the aircraft.",

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. One of the most used methods of increasing MCRIT is to sweep the wing back. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the free stream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

            "explanation": "Never regard any thunderstorm lightly, even when radar observers report the echoes are of light intensity. Avoiding thunderstorms is the best policy. Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 NM => this general guideline applies even to jet fighters and large airliners. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. • If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. • Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts • Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. “1. Descend to a lower altitude” CORRECT. The AOA of the wing has the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet, or pre-stall buffet, at either the high or low speed boundaries for the airplane. The higher the plane flies, the thinner the air and the greater the AOA required to produce the lift needed to maintain level flight. Increasing the AOA increases the speed of the airflow over the wing and the chances of Mach buffet. “4. Avoid cells by using weather radar” CORRECT. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

All of them involve doing something to change the flow on the upper surface. For example: Increase the leading edge radius, which speeds up the air down. Increase the thickness to chord ratio, which speeds up the air down. As far as the first example, increasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which increases the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given faster acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a slower aircraft speed.",

The Mach number may be calculated as follows: M = TAS / LSS LSS is determined by the formula LSS = 38.95 √ T in Kelvin. Hence, when temperature decreases, LSS also declines. With both TAS and LSS experiencing reduction, the Mach Number remains constant. Note: In terms of its impact on True Airspeed (TAS), density (ρ) holds a greater significance compared to temperature.

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

At high Mach numbers, an aircraft will become unstable with respect to speed; instead of an increasing push force being required as speed increases, a pull force becomes necessary to prevent the aircraft accelerating further. A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment. This unfavorable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted. It is operational at high Mach numbers in the transonic speed range. In the event of this equipment failing, the speed is limited to specified Mach number.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less. At the design stage of an airplane the inclusion of some characteristics will increase the value of the critical Mach number: A thin airfoil cross-section (low thickness to chord ratio). Generally, a thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Therefore, an airfoil with reduced camber will have a higher MCRIT.",

Should the aeroplane be fitted with supercritical aerofoils, the gap between MCRIT and MDIV is greater. Consequently, modern airliners can cruise slightly above MCRIT and it is beneficial to do so. Since CL/CD ratio is still high, their speed versus drag ratio is close to maximum here, which in turn means that specific range is also close to maximum at this velocity. Remember that Specific range (SR) is the distance an aircraft travels per unit of fuel consumed. Thrust required can be calculated: TR = W x CD/CL Thus, for a given velocity thrust required reduces with increasing CL/CD, as a consequence of which fuel consumption reduces.",

This means that a greater proportion of the suction pressure will come from the rear of the wing and the centre of pressure is further aft. The aerodynamic centre moves back to the 50% chord position during transonic flight. As speed increases beyond MCRIT, shock wave formation will generate a nose-down pitching moment because there is less lift forward of the CG, and downwash on the tailplane is reduced.

            "explanation": "Short explanation As the aircraft approaches drag divergence, its increasing speed causes both the coefficient of lift (CL) and coefficient of drag (CD) to increase, with CL continuing to rise until the point of shock stall. Additionally, the shockwave moves aft as the Mach number increases. Behind the shockwave, the air density increases. The temperature rises, this results in a higher LSS behind the shockwave. Detailed explanation: An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. As seen in figures 2 and 3, at speeds between M0.75 and drag divergence Mach number CL increases. This is due to the pressure distribution over the airfoil resulting from the aft movement of the shockwave.",

High speed buffet must be completely avoided.

Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range.

Further information: ICE ACCRETION The formation of ice on the surface of an aeroplane has a dramatically adverse effect on its performance. The most dangerous type of ice accretion is that which occurs when flying through cumulo-nimbus cloud or through supercooled water droplets ahead of a warm front because of its rapid accumulation. The effect that ice accretion has on an aeroplane’s performance includes: - increased mass; - decreased total lift; - decreased CLMAX (that is the most serious effect); - increased total drag; - up to 25% increased stalling speed; - reduced stalling angle; - changed aerofoil shape; - abnormal stalling characteristics. For an aeroplane in the take-off or landing configuration, ice accretion is extremely dangerous because of the close proximity of the normal operating speed to the stalling speed. Consequently, there is a very high risk of the aeroplane stalling when it is close to the ground.",

Gusts, or in other word abrupt wind changes (or windshear), are known to occur close to or in thunderstorm cells, thus particularly in ITCZ, in clear air turbulence (jet streams) and in wake turbulence. If an aerofoil encounters an upgust, it will experience an increase in angle of attack. For a given gust velocity, the increment in angle increases as the aircraft TAS decreases. If the angle of attack is already large (low speed), the increment due to the gust could cause the wing to stall. Furthermore, ice on the wings can raise the stall speed in various ways. The weight of ice adds to the aeroplane’s total weight, increasing the stall speed. Ice can change the shape of the aerofoil, either by reducing the coefficient of lift or the stalling angle of attack. Even a thin coating of ice can trigger separation by disrupting the smooth flow of air.",

The total effect of these factors for any aeroplane experiencing such weather conditions is to produce a much lower level of performance. The mass increase raises the stalling speed, whilst the reduced lift and increased drag together reduce the forward speed achieved. An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards.",

The main goal of the boundary layer fence is to restrict the spanwise flow of air. A swept wing at low speed has a large amount of spanwise airflow, this is because airflow hitting the leading edge will because of the angle be forced to move towards the tip of the wing. This leads to an almost completely diagonal airflow at the tip of the wing which causes it to stall first. To prevent the tip stall, the boundary layer fences are installed, which decrease the spanwise flow, and therefore improve low-speed stall characteristics.",

This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway => Light crosswinds may cause the vortices to drift. A 3 to 5 knot crosswind will tend to keep the upwind vortex in the runway area and may cause the downwind vortex to drift toward another runway.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

            "explanation": "\"I. The combination of a wing with sweepback and a T-tail make an aeroplane prone to deep stall.\" CORRECT. A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Aircraft with swept-back wings are prone to deep stall, regardless of horizontal stabilizer position (T-tail or low tail). T-tail will worsen recovery characteristics. Swept-forward wings at very high angle of attack are prone to deep stall as well. However, if a low horizontal tail is fitted, some pitch down moment may be produced with the help of the horizontal stabilizer since it is out of the separated turbulent wake of the wing. \"II. A stick pusher system can be fitted to an aeroplane that exhibits abnormal stall characteristics.\" CORRECT. A stick pusher is a system that will push the stick forward, lowering the nose and therefore decreasing the angle of attack to prevent a stall. Stick pushers are typically installed where the 'natural aerodynamic stall characteristics' of the aircraft are unacceptable and do not meet the regulatory requirements.",

THE EFFECT OF CONTAMINATION ON TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Any wing contamination greatly affects the take-off performance of the aircraft, with the associated increase in drag not only extending the take-off run, but also reducing the aircraft's climb performance. Any increase in the stall speed may also dangerously reduce the margin to stall on take-off, and may even reach a critical level, especially when operating in turbulent conditions. The resulting increase in aircraft drag also reduces the amount of excess thrust available at a given climb speed, thus decreasing the aircraft's angle of climb. The aircraft's rate of climb is similarly reduced. With severely contaminated wings, the pitch and roll pre-stall buffet characteristics (compared to a clean wing), may occur before the stick shaker activates.",

The low speed buffet boundary marks the onset of the pre stall buffet with a 10% margin above stall speed. The high speed buffet boundary marks the onset of high speed buffeting. This speed is Mmo most of the time, sometimes it is slightly below. These speeds come closer together as altitude increases. At a certain altitude the aircraft can encounter the so called “Coffin corner”. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are very close together here, and thus it is easy to stall or hit Mmo. The coffin corner is a dangerous situation and is supposed to be avoided, as a slight amount of turbulence could cause the aircraft to stall. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor. The margins between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: - Higher aircraft weight - Higher altitude - Higher load factor - More forward CG position",

It is also the energy lost due to friction within the boundary layer. Very close to the surface, the air molecules are slowed down and brought to a standstill relative to the aircraft's surface. All this is happening just a few millimetres of the surface. The boundary layer exists in two forms: Laminar flow is the thinnest layer, smooth and produces the least friction. Turbulent flow is unsteady, thicker, the layers become mixed and as a result produces more friction drag. The laminar layer transitions to the turbulent layer at the transition point. The airflow starts off as laminar flow, the speed increases steadily from the surface to the free stream and at some point along the airfoil's surface the airflow transits into turbulent flow. The difference in drag caused by the two states of the boundary layer is very marked about the same order of magnitude as the effect of streamlining, so it's understandable that much design effort is focussed on keeping the flow laminar for as long as possible. Thus, some aerofoils are designed to delay the transition by making it occur further aft so there is a greater area of laminar flow. But such aerofoils have their disadvantges: They produce less lift, so they tend to be used on aircraft that fly at higher speeds. The separtion point tends to move forward very quickly leading to a narrow stall region.",

Although the whole aircraft covers the same altitude during a complete turn, the wings follow differing spiral paths due to the variation in turn radius. During climbing turns, an aircraft describes an upward spiral path. Thus, the relative airflow comes downward to meet the wings, thereby reducing their angles of attack and hence their coefficients of lift. The faster moving outer wing is subject to a smaller reduction in angle of attack. This makes the net coefficient of lift higher than on the inner wing, thereby producing greater lift. Its increased velocity further enhances the lifting capability of the outer wing. An aircraft in a climbing turn therefore tends to overbank more than in a steady level turn.

            "explanation": "Over an aerofoil, airflow creates a series of static pressure zones, some low pressure and some high, depending on whether the air is fast or slow there. The air all arrives at \"freestream\" velocity, which we call the TAS, True Airspeed, but the way the streamlines of air split between top and bottom of the wing causes some to stretch away or squash towards each other, which increases or decreases the speed of the air. If you are familiar with the venturi tube, you know that air in the thin section is faster than air at the wide section, due to lower cross-sectional area. Well this happens above a wing also; the streamlines some distance above the wing remain straight (they have no idea the wing has passed beneath them), but the wing squashes the other streamlines into them, therefore creating faster airflow, and lower static pressure. Also, the opposite occurs for streamlines that get further apart: the air slows down, creating a high static pressure zone. This creates a pressure pattern around the wing, which obviously changes with the angle of attack, how the wing is presented to the airflow. Notice the low pressure zone on the top of the wing; that will get stronger and further towards the leading edge (up until the stall), as it is squeezing the air streamlines more, and the air is having to go much faster. Notice also how there is little to no pressure zone at the back, which can remain like that, or become a slight high pressure zone at high angles of attack. The air wants to flow from high to low pressure (against the direction of airflow). This means we have an \"adverse pressure gradient\". The top surface of the wing has air flowing along it, but due to the air interacting with other nearby air particles (we call this viscosity), this airflow does not reach the surface of the wing. The particles of air on the surface of the wing are stationary, and there is an increasing amount of airflow in each subsequent particle, moving away from the wing. We call this the boundary layer. The boundary layer obviously has some slow moving air, whereas the freestream air over the wing is quite fast. When an adverse pressure gradient builds up on the top surface of the wing, the particles in the boundary layer become more and more excited to flow from the high to low pressure, which means flowing backwards along the surface of the wing. This initially turns the laminar boundary layer into a turbulent one. The problem is, as soon as pressure gradient reaches a certain threshold, the particles will begin to flow backwards uncontrollably, creating vortices which separate from the wing and creates the stall (see annex above). This is compounded by the low energy of the boundary layer at high angles of attack, causing a lower speed airflow, to make stall happen at an even lower angle of attack. In terms of this question, the area covered by an adverse pressure gradient on the top of the aerofoil gets larger with increasing angle of attack, and the pressure gradient gets stronger also. The air in that area will have lower energy, and therefore lower speed due to this, eventually causing the stall, starting at the trailing edge and moving forwards to cover the whole wing upper surface.",

You are paying the price of slower speeds by using more power to fly, and also by having a reduced climb performance. This alone means that the pilot usually wants to retract the flaps to a clean configuration as-soon-as-possible. How soon that is, is a bit more complicated to answer. For starters, you need a specific (safe) speed for each notch of flaps to be retracted. Stall speed will increase every time you retract a notch of flaps so you want to be well above that speed before putting your hand on the flaps lever. So, in theory, the second the wheels are off the ground, you can just level off, keep flying a few feet above ground and keep accelerating until a safe speed is reached then retract flaps all the way to a clean configuration. In this case, the flaps are retracted right after take-off, when a positive rate of climb is observed (the pilot retracts the flaps when he/she should have retracted the landing gear). At this point, the speed is likely to be slower than the stall speed for a clean configuration - the aircraft may stall.",

If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’. Shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. As the shock wave moves aft over the surface of the wing, the CP also moves aft. This aft movement combined with the reduced downwash at the tail plane due to the presence of the shockwave will lead to Tuck Under. As we can see, from all the options, only one of them occurs when operating above MCRIT (transonic speed regime) and that’s ‘Mach buffet’.",

For airplanes equipped with stick pushers, its activation is also a full stall indication.

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that decreasing load factor (push-over maneuver) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is correct. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that increasing weight (mass) decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow.

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

            "explanation": "Spinning is a condition of stalled flight in which an aircraft describes a downward spiral path, and is normally the by-product of wing drop when operating near the stall. THE INCIPIENT SPIN (figures 1 and 2) If the wing drops at the stall, the resulting rolling action alters the direction of the relative airflow on to the wing. It increases the angle of attack of the down-going wing and reduces the angle of attack of the up-going wing. The down-going wing becomes more stalled, leading to a reduction in the coefficient of lift and an increase in the coefficient of drag. Conversely, the up-going wing becomes less stalled, leading to an increase in the coefficient of lift and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. The difference in lift between the wings produces a rolling moment and the aircraft rolls in the direction of the down-going wing. The yawing moment resulting from the large difference in drag between the down-going and up-going wings further aids this. These moments lead to autorotation: the aircraft continues to roll, a side-slip develops, and the nose drops. Without corrective action, the rate of rotation steadily increases, resulting in a fully developed spin. SPIN RECOVERY Although the POH is the primary reference for recovery from a spin, the following can be used as a general procedure: P - Retard the throttle to idle. In most aircraft, power hampers the recovery. A - Ailerons neutral. Many pilots will attempt to recover from the spin using the ailerons. This may actually make the problem worse. R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline. Remember to neutralize the rudder after the rotation stops.",

The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor. For each mass and altitude, a low and high speed buffet will be identified, which will then limit the range of speeds for the specific mass and altitude. The range of speeds (margin) between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: Higher aircraft weight - As the aircraft mass increases, the low speed buffet increases and the high speed buffet decreases. Higher altitude - As the aircraft climbs higher, the low speed buffet increases and the high speed buffet decreases. At the max altitude, there will be one available speed only (coffin corner). Higher load factor More forward CG position",

            ],
            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

Loss of lift is felt around the centre of gravity of the aircraft and the CP moves rearwards. The nose drops and angle of attack is reduced. The separated and turbulent airflow from the root affects the empennage and aerodynamic buffet will provide a warning of the approaching stall to the pilot. At low speeds, the dynamic pressure is low and greater control surface deflection will be required to achieve the same response. The flight controls will feel unresponsive or sloppy.

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that increasing load factor decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is correct. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that decreasing weight (mass) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

Flying at a different speed will not influence the buffet boundaries, therefore statement 1 is correct. At altitude, the equivalent stalling speed increases with ‘g’ rather more rapidly than at sea level, because of the Mach number effect on CLMAX. Also, the buffet boundary becomes much more severe. Above a certain altitude the buffet boundary may intersect the stall boundary at a value of ‘g’ lower than the structural limit. This ‘point’ is another representation of “coffin corner”.

Load factor = Lift/Weight, and also indicates the G-force felt by the aircraft and occupants. A load factor of 2.25 means 2.25Gs of force, and also means that the wings are producing 2.25x the lift required to counteract weight. With this much lift being produced, a high angle of attack is required and the stall speed therefore increases massively. This is the same as flying a steep turn. Given that the equation to find the new stall speed is: VS = VS1G √n Where: VS is the new stall speed VS1G is the 1G stall speed n is the load factor And given that VS1G = 175 kt and n = 2.25 VS = 175 √2.25 VS = 262.5 kt Closest answer 261 kt",

The rotation is stable and will continue due to remaining aerodynamic forces. During the spin, the wings remain unequally stalled. The key to recovery is first identifying the direction of the spin and then applying opposite yaw. In an erect (upright) spin, the aircraft yaws rapidly in the direction of the spin and typically rolls in the same direction. However, if the spin is unstable, the roll may not align with the spin direction and can even reverse. In an inverted spin, yaw and roll are almost always in opposite directions. The turn indicator and turn coordinator behave differently during a spin. A turn indicator, which is not sensitive to roll, correctly identifies the direction of the spin. Conversely, a turn coordinator, which is sensitive to roll, may indicate the wrong spin direction during an unstable or inverted spin. Thus, a turn indicator is the preferred instrument for aerobatic aircraft and those with more challenging spinning characteristics.",

When Mcrit is exceeded => first shock waves form and they grow more powerful before they can produce enough separation for mach buffet to occur.",

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is called the transition point. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction. This air creates more drag than the laminar air flow, has more kinetic energy (higher mean speed) and breaks down less easily and is therefore more stable.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d. Unresponsive flight controls.",

            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

This turbulent flow hitting the tailplane and elevator is the primary cause of the natural buffeting felt in some aeroplanes. If an aircraft does not present with natural buffeting before the stall, then stall warners or stick shakers will be fitted to warn of the impending stall. As for the other options: The centre of pressure does move aft during the stall of most wings, which helps provide the necessary pitch down moment to break the stall and begin recovery, however, it is not the cause of any buffeting. A stall occurring over the section of the wing with ailerons would cause aileron buffeting through the controls, but this means the wing is completely stalled, not pre-stall, as the wing root is designed to stall first, and the wing tips are designed to stall last, to preserve aileron effectiveness in the stall and prevent wing drops.",

The turbulent flow in the boundary layer delays the flow separation resulting in increased controllability of the airplane in stall.

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. Note: Flying in turbulent conditions may cause sudden changes in speed and load factor. Looking at the buffet margin graph attached, we can conclude that both speed/mach variations and changes in load factor may bring the aircraft closer to one of the buffet margins.",

Notably the true airspeed of the low-speed stall increases with increasing altitude for a given indicated airspeed, whilst the true airspeed of the shock stall reduces up to the base of the tropopause, above which it remains constant. The point at which the two stalls coincide is referred to as the 'coffin corner'. The altitude at which an aircraft can fly at one airspeed in a 1 g maneuver is called the aerodynamic ceiling.

The Critical angle of attack depends on the aerodynamic design of a wing, and it is independent of other factors, namely weight. Because most aircraft do not have angle of attack indicators, the pilot has to rely on airspeed indications. However, the speed at which the aircraft will stall is variable depending on the effects of the following properties: Weight, Actual weight, Load factor (g in a turn), Effective weight/center of gravity position, Altitude, Wing design/lift, Configuration and Propeller engine power.",

In a spin, the aircraft is stalled but not evenly, and the inside wing has a higher angle of attack so is stalled more than the outside wing, creating a continuous spiraling stall, called a spin. The way to recover from a stall is given in the POH, but a general rule for most aircraft is as follows. P - Retard the throttle to idle. In most aircraft, power hampers the recovery. A - Ailerons neutral. Many pilots will attempt to recover from the spin using the ailerons. This may actually make the problem worse. R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline. Remember to neutralize the rudder after the rotation stops. The application of aft elevator pressure could quite easily send the aircraft into a further stall/spin, as this would try to continue increasing the angle of attack. However, if the aircraft becomes fully unstalled, then this action may actually take the aircraft into a spiral dive instead and potentially overload the wings with high load factor. As for the other options, a secondary spin in the other direction usually comes from continuing to apply rudder after recovering (with too low airspeed) and yaw instability is not related to this scenario. The aircraft is also descending through this process, so no climb rate should be expected.",

The high speed buffet boundary describes the IAS at which we find the onset of Mach related buffet, normally MMO, but sometimes slightly below that. At low altitudes, these speeds are far apart, leaving a wide range of operating speeds. Although stalling IAS remains constant at first as altitude increases, it starts to increase at higher altitude. Also, the IAS at which we get Mach buffet will steadily decrease, because TAS increases in the climb and local speed of sound decreases. The two buffet boundaries will move closer toogether and eventually meet at an altitude where no margins exists, the coffin corner or aerodynamic ceiling, i.e. you cannot fly faster or slower because you will either stall or hit MMO. The right-hand limit on the graph shows the maximum indicated airspeed VMO and then at high altitude the maximum Mach number, MMO. The left-hand limit is based on the stall speed, 1.1 VS. Therefore, with increasing altitude, the low-speed buffet will increase and the high-speed buffet will decrease.",

            "explanation": "A forward CG shift will result in a larger downforce required by the tailplane which increases the need for lift. If thrust decreases, the support of weight decreases. Consequently, more lift is required which means that the angle of attack must be increased. This will increase the stall speed. Any airplane, within the limits of its structure and the strength of the pilot, can be stalled at any airspeed. VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. In this exercise: Start by drawing a line from de 30° bank that intersects the 140-ton curve. From here, draw a straight line from right to left that intersects the FL360 curve. The goal is to have to intersection points, which correspond to the lowest and highest limits of the buffet boundaries. In this case, the low speed boundary is M0.74 and the high-speed boundary is M 0.84.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",
