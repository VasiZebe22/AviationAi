            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

On many flap control systems, the deflection on the two sides is compared while the flaps are moving, and if one side should fail, movement on the other side is automatically stopped. However, on less sophisticated systems a failure of the operating mechanism could lead to an asymmetric situation. The difference in lift will cause a rolling moment which must be opposed by the ailerons, and the difference in drag will cause a yawing moment which must be opposed by the rudder. Whether the controls will be adequate to maintain straight and level flight will depend on the degree of asymmetry and the control power available.",

Take a look at the Cirrus SR-22 examples in the attached figure. Notice the difference in wingtip vortex size at altitude, vs. near the ground? When your wing is close to the ground, wingtip vortices can't get as big, because as they spin around your wingtip, they impact the ground and dissipate. The result? A reduction in downwash. Less downwash, less drag. Summary: Flying low to the ground limits your vortices, making them smaller. This means that the air flowing off the back of your wing has less downwash. Ground effect is definitely experienced within half a wingspan. In this question, the wingspan equals 20 m which equals approximately 60 ft (65 ft to be exact).",

If the angle of attack increases, the upper surface force increases, while the lower surface force decreases. Trailing-Edge Lift Augmentation A flap is a hinged portion of the trailing or leading-edge, which can be deflected downwards and produce an increase of camber. For low speed aerofoils, the flaps will be on the trailing edge only. When the flaps are lowered, CLMAX is increased, but the stalling angle is reduced. This is because lowering the flap increases the effective angle of attack due to the changed camber.",

            "explanation": "High-lift devices are incredibly important for the operation of aircraft. Particularly for large commercial jet aircraft, the use of flaps and slats is essential to allow acceptable take-off distances and land with reasonable speeds. They are incredibly powerful, which causes a massive problem if the flaps operate differently from each other, which we call flap/slat asymmetry. This is possible for many reasons, but a common one is if a flap extension/retraction system jams, the two flap settings will become different from each other. Flap asymmetry is worse than slat asymmetry. Flaps provide a large increase in coefficient of lift and in drag for the same angle of attack as a clean wing, whereas slats increase drag slightly, but delay the stall greatly, allowing the aircraft to fly at a much higher angle of attack. Therefore, a flap asymmetry will cause a large rolling moment away from the extend flaps. and a strong yaw towards the side of the extended flaps. Therefore, to counteract this as pilots, we must roll towards the extended side, and yaw away from the extended side. On this flap indicator, our right-hand flaps are at flap 15 extension, so must have jammed, and our left-hand flaps are retracting through flap 5/flap 2. We must therefore roll to the right and yaw to the left to maintain straight and level flight. This is a flap display off the Boeing 737 and actually indicates the location of flaps and slats, if you know the order of flap extension/retraction, but the examiner wants to keep things simple by saying it is only trailing-edge flaps.",

The undercarriage extension increases all the three elements, so parasite drag increases too.

Air directly in contact with the surface of the aeroplane will be dragged along at a slightly lower speed than that of the aeroplane because of the inherent cohesion of the air. The air further away from the surface of the aeroplane will be pulled along but at a lower speed than the surface air. This dragging effect decreases with increasing depth of the layer of air until at a particular depth the movement of the aeroplane does not affect the air at all. The depth of the layer of air from the aeroplane surface to the depth at which the air is unaffected is the boundary layer. The value of surface-friction drag varies and is determined by: - the total surface area of the aeroplane; - the coefficient of the air viscosity; - the rate of change of flow speed over the depth of the boundary layer. FLOW TRANSITION The nearer the transition point is to the leading edge of an aerofoil the greater is the amount of surface friction. The location of the transition point from laminar flow to turbulent flow is dependent on four factors: - surface condition; - speed of flow; - size of the object; - adverse pressure gradient. SURFACE CONDITION The depth of the boundary layer, both laminar and turbulent, increase with distance from the leading edge of an aerofoil. A rough, dirty, wet, or ice-covered surface will increase the depth of this layer causing greater interference with the airflow over the aerofoil. Polishing the aerofoil surface minimises the effect of this type of drag.",

            "explanation": "A tapered wing means that the wing chord line gets shorter going from root to tip. The chord of the wing is long at the root but shorter at the tip. Tapered wings are structurally very strong, as the wing root is a lot bigger, allowing for a stronger connection to the fuselage, and the wing gradually gets thinner towards the wingtip where less reinforcement is required. There are some aerodynamic benefits to tapered wings as well, which includes a small reduction in induced drag, due to the majority of the lift coming from the wing closer to the root. One of the problems with a tapered wing is the stall handling. On a rectangular wing, the stall begins at the back near the root, whereas on a tapered wing, the stall will begin near the tip instead, which leads to the aileron area becoming stalled, and losing aileron (roll) control (see first annex above). The taper of a wing is measured by the taper ratio, which is simply Taper ratio = tip chord / root chord So if the taper ratio is 0.5, the wingtip is half as wide as the root. Any number less than 1 indicates that the wing is tapered. 1 means the chord stays the same along the whole wingspan, more than 1 would be a wing that gets wider.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50% The increase in stall speed due to ice formation is not easy to quantify, as the accumulation and shape of the ice formation is impossible to predict.

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. Another characteristic associated with ground effect is the change in aircraft trim and stability. This occurs because the surface deflects the downwash acting behind the wing, thus altering the angle at which the airflow meets the tail plane This places the tail plane at a less negative, or increased angle of attack, and reduces the download acting on the tail plane. In this condition, the aircraft experiences a nose-down pitching moment (figure 2). A high T tailed aircraft do not respond in this manner since the tail plane is outside the influence of the downwash.",

This question is specifically asking for: Angle of attack: The strength of the vortices (and therefore also induced drag) is proportional to the angle of attack. Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct! Aspect ratio: The strength of the vortices is inversely proportional with the aspect ratio. Meaning that the strength of the wing tip vortices increase as the aspect ratio decreases.

            "explanation": "Terminology definition angle of attack: angle between the chord line and the relative (undisturbed) air flow. Local airflow = downwash at the trailing edge of the airfoil for example. Angle of attack (AOA, α - Greek letter alpha) is a term used in aerodynamics to describe the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion between the airfoil and the air through which it is moving. For a two-dimensional airfoil, angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the direction of arrival of the incoming air. In aviation, angle of attack is used to describe the angle between the chord line of the (three dimensional) wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. The angle of attack is often confused with the pitch angle of an aircraft and the angle of incidence. Pitch angle and angle of incidence are measured from the same reference line as angle of attack (conceptually the chord line), but pitch refers to the horizon and angle of incidence to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. Whereas, the angle of attack is measured from the (same) reference line to the direction of the arrival of the air to the wing (caused by the relative motion between the wing and the atmosphere). Note: Some tricky questions ask about the angle of attack of the aeroplane (not the wing) => angle between speed vector and longitudinal axis.",

It is created by the vortices at the tip of an aircraft's wing. The magnitude of induced drag depends on the amount of lift being generated by the wing and on the shape and size of the wing. Induced drag can be reduced by: Using a high aspect ratio wing planform => Wings with high aspect ratio have lower induced drag than wings with low aspect ratio for the same wing area. So wings with a long span and a short chord have lower induced drag than wings with a short span and a long chord. Using a tapered wing planform with wing twist and/or spanwise camber variation, or incorporation of wing end plates, tip tanks, winglets or various wing tip shapes. Note: Winglets are small vertical aerofoils which form part of the wing tip; they reduce tip vortex intensity, thus reduce induced drag - this is their only function.",

Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

Above the tropopause, temperature remains constant. Consequently, LSS will also remain unchanged. In order to maintain a constant Mach number, TAS must also remain unchanged. With increasing altitude, pressure continues to fall. This causes density to reduce with increasing altitude. IAS is a measurement of dynamic pressure. Dynamic pressure = 1/2 p V2, where V equals TAS. With a decreasing density (p) and constant TAS, IAS decreases. Now let's take a look at the lift formula: L = 1/2 p V2 S CL A decrease in IAS, with all remaining variables being the same would result in a decrease in lift.

Within the boundary layer, the laminar layer is the thinnest and generates the least friction. However, as this laminar layer progresses toward the transition point, it transitions into the turbulent layer. This turbulent layer is thicker and contributes to higher friction drag. To enhance aerodynamic performance, certain aerofoils are engineered to delay this transition, allowing it to occur further downstream. This strategy increases the extent of laminar flow, reducing overall friction drag. For instance, vortex generators may be used to extend the laminar flow by energizing the boundary layer and creating turbulent flow, which does cause more drag indeed, but that's how separation is delayed which is actually more important when you look at the big picture. Vortex generators are located on the upper surface of a wing to create a slightly disturbed airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing. The higher energy level delays the boundary layer separation (resulting in an extended laminar flow section), which reduces the stall speed.",

It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic.",

It represents the maximum speed where no part of the wing goes supersonic, especially where airflow accelerates most over the wing's upper surface. This acceleration is linked to the wing's curvature, or camber. When the angle of attack (AoA) increases, airflow over the wing's upper surface speeds up even more. Thus, a higher angle of attack leads to a lower MCRIT because sonic speed is reached at a slower flying speed. Imagine two planes flying at the same constant speed at level flight (n = 1), one heavier than the other. The heavier plane needs increase its angle of attack to generate enough lift to stay up because it's heavier. As the angle of attack increases, the air above the heavier plane's wing speeds up more, even though both planes are flying at the same IAS. The heavier one would hit the speed of sound over its wings before the lighter one, even if they had the same IAS. This happens because the heavier plane needs to have a higher angle of attack to stay at the same speed, which means it's already pushing the air faster over its wings. Thus, owing to the increased angle of attack needed to sustain flight at a given IAS, the heavier aircraft demonstrates a lower MCRIT compared to the lighter one.",

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. As stated above, the Local Speed of Sound (LSS) is solely dependent on the Air Temperature. After the shockwave, the temperature increases and, therefore, the LSS also increases.",

            "explanation": "Mach trim is used to trim the aircraft at high Mach numbers (e.g. B737 from Mach.615). It prevents instability and tuck under (which appears above MCRIT) due to an increased pitch down moment, which is caused the following reasons: CP moves aft shock waves at the wing root reduced effectiveness of the tailplane Mach trim counteracts (increases pitch up) by one of the following: adjusting stabilizer adjusting elevator trim tank (fuel pumped to the tail) Outcome: stick force gradient will be maintained longitudinal stability will be increased tuck under will be avoided Mach Trim System relates to the pitch channel of the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS). It is designed as an AFCS sub-system and is therefore, like the yaw damper, operational irrespective of whether or not the AFCS is active (autopilot engaged or disengaged). The heart of the Mach trim system is the coupler unit. This receives signals, corresponding to Mach number, from the Air Data Computer (ADC). Whenever these signals exceed the pre-set value (for the aeroplane type) the trim coupler unit releases the brake and the speed signal from the ADC is fed to the motor. This causes the stabiliser to move in such a way that the elevators are driven upward, counteracting any tendency to a \"Mach Tuck-under\". Internal monitoring of the system provides a failure warning in the form of the illumination of a fail indicator light. Although connected to the pitch channel the system is totally independent of the pitch control channel of the AFCS. In other words, the Mach trim system provides speed stability at higher Mach numbers. It operates (adjusts the elevators with respect to the stabilizer as speed increases) only above certain minimum Mach number - for example on a B737-300 it is above Mach 0.615. With the Mach trim system INOP the maximum speed of the aircraft is typically limited to a lower Mach number than normally. \"Tuck-under\" is the phenomena encountered by aeroplanes flying at high subsonic, transonic or supersonic speeds. In these speed regimes there is typically a significant rearward movement of the Centre of Pressure (CP). In order to prevent this becoming an uncontrollable \"nose-down\" pitching motion, it is necessary to provide some form of compensation. This is done by the use of a Mach Trim System. Or otherwise said the Mach trim system allows to increase the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft by changing the horizontal stabilizer according to the Mach number.",

It occurs well before reaching Mach 1 speed. Mach tuck can be caused by two things; a rearward movement of the center op pressure (CP) and a decrease in wing downwash at the tailplane. Both of these conditions cause a pitch down effect, as they generate a (bigger) positive moment aft of the CG. When the airflow around the airfoil starts reaching supersonic speed (this can happen before the aircraft flies at Mach 1 speed), small shockwave forms over the upper side of the wing, generating a large amount of lift. If speed increases, this shockwave will move backwards to the mid chord position, causing the CP to move backwards. The adjusted flow over the wings can reduce downwash on the tailplane, contributing to Mach tuck.",

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

For the example shown, the maximum effective deflection of the elevator is not capable of trimming the airplane at CLMAX for CG positions ahead of 18 percent MAC. This control requirement can be most critical for an airplane in supersonic flight. Supersonic flight is usually accompanied by large increases in static longitudinal stability (due to aft CP movement) and a reduction in the effectiveness of control surfaces. To cope with these trends, powerful all-moving surfaces must be used to attain limit load factor or maximum usable CL in supersonic flight. This requirement is so important that once satisfied, the supersonic configuration usually has sufficient longitudinal control power for all other conditions of flight. Note: When supersonic flight is being discussed, both the aerodynamic center (AC) and the center of pressure (CP) of a wing tend to shift towards the midpoint of the wing, which is typically around 50% of the chord.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

Please send further feedback if you see this in the exam, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. The differences between conventional (low mounted) horizontal stabilisers and T-Tail (high mounted) horizontal stabilisers are many. Other than the increased efficiencies of the T-Tail, one of the primary differences is that it is not in the wake of the main wing during normal flight. They can be in the wake of the main wing at the stall though, causing a potentially unrecoverable deep stall. At normal flying speeds, the pitch angle of the aircraft to maintain level flight is such that the T-Tail is far above the wake of the main wing, so when in the transonic speed range, the reducing downwash of the main wing will not really affect the tailplane, as it would do a conventional tailplane. So for this question, we believe that the downwash will not change by a noticeable amount, and there will be little to no buffet on the horizontal stabiliser, due to its distance from the wake of the man wing. We must remember that the main wing is the first place on the aircraft that forms a shockwave, so the separation will cause the main wing to have a turbulent wake. This is what we believe the examiner is asking about, not when the tailplane itself forms a shockwave.",

            "explanation": "An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. Thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Deflecting a control surface upward decreases camber, this will arrest the aft movement of the shockwave (or, in fact, move it slightly forward) due to the increase in MCRIT.",

If you encounter this question in your official exam, please let us know. Our team is currently working on the figure for this explanation. Thank you for your patience. High-speed aerofoil sections are typically thin and sharp, while slow-speed designs have rounder leading edges and more camber. The attached graph compares a typical high-speed section with a general-purpose low-speed aerofoil. To generate the necessary lift in their respective speed regimes, these two aerofoils have different CL (coefficient of lift) requirements. The low-speed aerofoil is designed with greater thickness and camber to achieve a higher CL, enabling it to produce sufficient lift at lower speeds. Conversely, the high-speed aerofoil is much thinner and less cambered, resulting in a smaller CL. However, this reduced CL is compensated by the higher IAS (indicated airspeed) at which the high-speed aerofoil usually operates. A high speed aerofoil: Tens to have less camber, so the CL/Alpha line is below that fo a slow speed aerofoil. Tends to be thinner, so the critical angle is significantly smaller. The thinner aerofoil also has a significantly lower CLMAX.",

Effect on Mach Number of Climbing at a Constant IAS: - Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound will decrease as altitude is increased. - If altitude is increased at a constant IAS, the TAS increases. - Therefore, the Mach number will increase if altitude is increased at a constant IAS. This is because TAS gets bigger and LSS gets smaller.

Aircraft certified under CS-25 (and some aircraft under CS-23) are given maximum flight speeds as a VMO and MMO (maximum operating airspeed/Mach No.). Depending on the altitude and air temperature, one of these will correspond to a lower airspeed than the other. That one will be the most limiting. The MMO is most limiting at high altitudes, which is when it is most useful for us to refer to our speed in Mach No., whereas at lower altitudes, the VMO is most limiting, and we should use IAS/CAS instead. The point where this crossover happens is called the crossover altitude. A common altitude for this is around 28000 ft, but it depends on the aircraft and conditions. If descending at a constant mach number, the Mach number will not exceed the MMO (as it is constant), but using the ECTM graph above, we can see that the IAS will be increasing, and therefore the IAS may well reach and exceed VMO if the crossover is delayed to a lower altitude. The other two options \"shock stall speed\" and \"never exceed speed\" can be discounted here, as aircraft with VMO/MMO do not have a VNE and the shock stall speed occurs based on the Mach No. and MMO, both of which we know remain constant (and it is not a limiting speed as such).",

In the constant IAS phase of the climb, density (rho) is decreasing and V is increasing which maintains dynamic pressure at a constant. Therefore, there is no change in CL.

            "explanation": "An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

Flow separation occurs because the boundary layer loses kinetic energy as it flows against the adverse pressure gradient. Shock wave formation increases the adverse pressure gradient so the loss of kinetic energy in the boundary layer will be greater. Increasing the kinetic energy of the boundary layer will reduce flow separation. Simple devices called vortex generators are used to re-energize the boundary layer. Vortex generators are small plates, vanes, blades, or wedges mounted in spanwise rows along the wing surface. Each vortex generator produces a vortex at its tip which will induce high energy air from the free stream flow to mix with the boundary layer, thus increasing its kinetic energy and helping it flow through the shock wave with much less separation. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. It should be noted that vortex generators may also be used on subsonic aircraft to prevent separation caused by high adverse pressure gradients due to the contours of the surface.",

            "explanation": "When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. Above MCRIT, the air flowing over the top of the wing becomes supersonic, and at the point at which the air wants to decelerate back below Mach 1.0, a shockwave is formed. This shockwaves is a very thin surface where the characteristics of the air change dramatically, and can cause some airflow separation, leading to an effect called the shock stall. There are many ways to delay MCRIT and the shock stall, one of which is to fly with a supercritical wing. A supercritical aerofoil has a much flatter top surface, which not only increases MCRIT and MDD (drag divergence)* but also creates a weaker shockwave when one is formed, just above MCRIT. The shockwaves on a supercritical aerofoil quickly move to the trailing edge, making the shock stall a much smaller effect. For civilian applications, the main benefit is the faster speed that can be flown, before drag increases due to wave drag. The higher MCRIT/MDD and ability to fly just above MCRIT with little extra drag is very useful for long range jet aeroplanes, for extra range, speed and ability to fly at higher altitudes. *MDD (drag divergence Mach number) is a speed which comes just above MCRIT, where the drag begins to increase rapidly with increase in speed. This is what we really want to make higher, and using a supercritical aerofoil does exactly that.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. In supersonic flight, the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag, which occurs due to the formation of shockwaves at certain critical points on the aircraft's surface. A thinner wing with a smaller leading edge radius will produce smaller shockwaves and thus less wave drag.",

Effect on Mach Number of Climbing at a Constant IAS: Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound will decrease as altitude is increased.

All of them involve doing something to change the flow on the upper surface. For example: Decrease the leading edge radius, which slows the air down. Decrease the thickness to chord ratio, which slows the air down. Sweep back, which effectively reduces the thickness to chord ratio, as far as the air molecules are concerned, so slows the air down. Vortex generators, which bring in air from outside the boundary layer delaying the onset of the critical Mach number and pushing the shockwave formation further back. Supercritical wing, which has a flatter upper surface so the air is not accelerated so much and pushes the shockwave formation further back. As far as the first example, decreasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thinner, less rounded leading edge, which reduces the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT increases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given lower acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a higher aircraft speed.",

At high altitude, a large high-speed jet transport aircraft will be cruising at a speed marginally above its critical Mach number, and it will have a small shock wave on the wing. If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’ because it results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. In the transonic range, the ‘shock stall’ is the separation of the boundary layer from the upper surface of the wing behind a shockwave. This causes the total lift generated to decrease. Unlike the normal high-incidence angle stall, the ‘shock stall’ occurs at low angles of attack and at an unexpectedly high IAS. For swept-wing airplanes because the wing-tips stall first the airplane has a nose-up pitch tendency. The angle of attack of the high-speed shock stall decreases as the Mach number increases and CLMAX decreases in a similar manner. Because the turbulent airflow behind a shockwave results in an increased loss of lift, any large rapid increase of speed can induce a premature stall.",

This is an incredibly thin layer of air where the particles \"catch up\" to each other, and along with creating the familiar \"sonic boom\" shockwave, increases the static pressure, temperature and density of the air as it flows through, whilst reducing the velocity of the air considerably. These effects cause the boundary layer above the wing to be very easily disturbed, inducing flow separation behind the shockwave. This separated airflow does not produce lift and this leads to the \"shock stall\" effect that can occur at these transonic speeds. As can be seen on the diagram above, initially the shockwave and boundary layer separation occur on the upper surface of the wing, approximately half-way along, then move backwards as the speed increases. A smaller shockwave also occurs on the underside of the wing near the trailing edge at slightly higher speeds, also moving towards the trailing edge as the aircraft accelerates further. Therefore, the best option here is on the upper surface, just ahead of the trailing edge. We are sceptical about that last bit of wording, but it is certainly the only possibly correct option in our opinion.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

In the troposphere, the temperature decreases linearly with altitude at a constant rate of -1,98°C/1000 ft. The lower portion of the stratosphere is an isothermal layer where the temperature remains constant (approximately -57°C) with increasing height, and then in its upper layers the temperature increases to around 0° C at the stratopause. For the study of high speed flight we are interested in the speed at which the infinitesimally small pressure disturbances (waves) travel through the atmosphere. Pressure waves ‘propagate’ from their source, that is, each air molecule is rapidly vibrated in turn and passes on the disturbance to its neighbour. The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. The higher the temperature, the higher the speed of propagation. Therefore only possible answer can be LSS will decrease in the troposphere. Since temperature decreases with increasing altitude in the troposphere LSS would decrease with temperature as well.",

As the SAT increases, the air molecules become less dense, resulting in a higher TAS for a given CAS. Therefore, in the given scenario, where the temperature SAT increases from -35°C to -30°C, the TAS will also increase. The Mach number (M) is the ratio of the true airspeed (TAS) to the local speed of sound (LSS), and it’s a measure of compressibility.

Because of the critical Mach number, it is possible that shockwaves can occur at speeds even below Mach 1. As the aircraft speeds up beyond this critical Mach number, drag increases dramatically. If the aircraft is not designed for transonic or supersonic flight, this could lead to controllability problems. The critical Mach number increases with increasing wing sweepback. Thinner airfoils also increase the value of Mcrit. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag on an airfoil begins to increase rapidly as the Mach number increases. The drag coefficient can multiply to 10 times its size compared to its low speed value. The drag divergence Mach number is a number bigger than Mcrit and smaller than Mach 1.

            "explanation": "When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required as part of creating lift. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, for instance, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. A large factor of the MCRIT is the thickness of the aerofoil, as thicker aerofoils \"squash\" the air above the wing more, thereby speeding it up more. Therefore, thinner aerofoils are more suited to high speed flight, as they have a higher MCRIT, and also handle the transonic speed regime better in general. For this question, then, thicker aerofoils decrease the MCRIT (which is bad), and thinner aerofoils increase MCRIT (good).",

Part of the airflow is below sonic speed; another part is over sonic speed. Supersonic flow: 1.2 < M ≤ 5 In this region the airflow is over sonic speed everywhere about the aircraft. The aerodynamic characteristics change again. Hypersonic flow: 5 < M Due to aerodynamix heating, the air is ionised.

            "explanation": "An airplane flying at low, subsonic, speeds causes air-pressure changes because of its movement but they are relatively small. It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic. The Local Speed of Sound is defined by: LSS=38.95∗√(T(K)) The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. Thus, if behind a shock wave temperature increases, the LSS also increases.",

            "explanation": "EFFECTS OF SHOCKWAVE FORMATION The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. FLYING CONTROLS The deflection of a conventional hinged-flap type of control creates a force ahead of the control surface that is normally greater than that which the control surface itself produces. When there is a shockwave established on the lifting surface ahead of the control surface this is no longer the case because pressure variations cannot be transmitted forward through the shockwave. The shockwave moves slightly aft when an aileron is deflected downwards. This effectively diminishes the result of deflecting the control surface because only the airflow passing over the control surface is modified. This effect is exacerbated when the shockwave reaches the trailing edge of the aerofoil and the control effectiveness is decreased even further. In transonic flight the ailerons are less effective than in subsonic flight because aileron deflection only partially affects the pressure distribution around the wing. These characteristics have led to the substitution of the tailplane and elevator combination in high-speed aeroplanes with a fully flying horizontal stabiliser. On these aeroplanes the conventional wing-tip ailerons are replaced with differential spoilers and/or inboard ailerons that are for use when the aeroplane is flying at transonic speeds. Because of the increased input forces required from the pilot during flight at transonic speeds and the large variation of the stick forces encountered during the transition of the shockwave over the control surface, most high-speed aeroplanes are fitted with fully power-operated controls.",

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular (90 degrees), or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced.",

Students have confirmed that the option \"The airflow becomes more turbulent due to the presence of areas of Increased compressibility slowing down the speed of the airflow.\" Was not correct in exams. Please let us know if you come across this question in your examination. Thank you! As an aircraft accelerates to high speeds, it enters a regime where the effects of compressibility become significant. The critical Mach number (MCRIT) is the airspeed at which the local airflow over certain parts of the aircraft (typically near the wing's leading edge or other protuberances) reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1). The airflow over the aircraft's surfaces starts to approach or reach the speed of sound. This means that some parts of the aircraft may experience local airflow velocities at or near Mach 1. This increased compressibility is what leads to changes in the behavior of the airflow. As the airflow reaches or exceeds Mach 1 locally, shock waves can start to form. These are sudden, discontinuous changes in air pressure and density. Shock waves can form on the wings, fuselage, and other parts of the aircraft that have particular shapes or characteristics that cause local acceleration of the airflow. One of the consequences of compressibility effects is that the total pressure of the airflow increases. This increase in total pressure can lead to an artificially high reading on instruments like the airspeed indicator. CAS measures the pressure differential between the pitot tube (which senses ram air pressure) and static pressure. At high speeds, the ram air pressure component becomes significant, causing CAS to read higher than TAS.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

            "explanation": "The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON LIFT At low subsonic speeds the lift coefficient CL is assumed to be constant at a given angle of attack. With increasing Mach number, however, it will vary. At speeds above MCRIT a shock wave will have formed on the upper surface. This may cause boundary layer separation aft of the shock wave, causing loss of lift. Shock stall results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. Shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value (for a given angle of attack). EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON THE LIFT CURVE AND CLMAX At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4, CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 1. At a constant angle of attack, the increase of CL as speed increases from about M 0.4 into the low end of the transonic region gives a steeper lift curve slope, i.e. the change of CL per degree angle of attack will increase, as seen in figure 2. Because of earlier separation resulting from the formation of the shock wave, CLMAX and the stalling angle will be reduced.",

At the lower critical Mach number, the airflow around the entire aircraft is subsonic. At the higher critical Mach number, the airflow around the whole aircraft is supersonic. Because of the critical Mach number, it is possible that shockwaves can occur at speeds even below Mach 1. As the aircraft speeds up beyond this critical Mach number, drag increases dramatically. If the aircraft is not designed for transonic or supersonic flight, this could lead to controllability problems. The critical Mach number increases with increasing wing sweepback. Thinner airfoils also increase the value of MCRIT. The critical Mach number decreases with increasing Angle of Attack. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag on an airfoil begins to increase rapidly as the Mach number increases. The drag coefficient can multiply to 10 times its size compared to its low speed value. The drag divergence Mach number is a number bigger than Mcrit and smaller than Mach 1. The drag divergence Mach number can be increased by increasing wing sweepback.",

The easiest way to understand this is by remembering that the aircraft produces pressure waves ahead of it (its wings in this context) which \"tell the air that the wing is coming\", so the air can begin to move out of the way. These pressure waves can only move at the speed of sound though, so as the aircraft itself starts going faster, the air gets less and less time to move away from the oncoming wing. This leads to a more aggressive uplift of air just ahead of the wing leading edge at high subsonic speeds, and this takes some energy out of the airflow (amongst some other effects). Together, these lead to a stall at lower angles of attack than usual. Therefore, when accelerating into the transonic regime, the wing's critical angle of attack (angle at which it stalls) reduces due to the compressibility effects ahead of the wing.",

This will provide better flight characteristics and lower drag in the transonic speed regime where large jets often operate. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the freestream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. This agrees with what we would expect as cos(0) = 1 and therefore the perpendicular airflow to the wing is the same as the freestream airflow when no sweep angle exists (i.e. an unswept wing) The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

Swept wings can be very useful for high speed flight, as the effectively lengthen the chord of the wing, so therefore decrease the thickness-to-chord ratio, effectively making the wing behave like a thinner wing and having a higher MCRIT. Swept wings do pay for this in other areas though, such as low speed flight, where they have a tendency to stall at the tips first, as well as lower lift for the same angle of attack, and less effective high lift devices. High lift devices are less effective on swept wings, take trailing edge flaps for example, simply because the hinge line is not perpendicular to the airflow, and this puts the flaps at an angle, which decreases their effectiveness. The steeper the sweep angle, the stronger this effect. Therefore, the worst wing type from these options is the one with the greatest sweepback of 25°.",

Severe instability can occur at transonic speeds. Shock waves can cause large-scale separation downstream, increasing drag and adding asymmetry and unsteadiness to the flow around the aircraft. When entering the transonic speed range, the Center of Pressure (CP) moves backward, causing a pitch down moment. To counteract this, the aircraft should apply a pitch up moment to the elevator or stabilizer. When exiting this range and returning to subsonic speed, the opposite should be done by applying a pitch down input to the elevator or stabilizer.",

For best specific range (nautical miles per kg of fuel used) we need maximum TAS / Drag ratio. TAS can be maximised without a significant drag penalty, if we fly just above MCRIT. This is because, when Mcrit is first exceeded, the extra drag caused by the shock waves will be minimal, (especially on supercritical wings), provided that speed is kept below the drag divergence Mach number. The TAS / Drag ratio also increases, if TAS can be increased without an increase in IAS. This can be achieved by increasing altitude. So best specific range is achieved by cruising just above MCRIT, and by flying as high as other considerations permit.",

The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge.

Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less.

The area rule states that provided the cross-sectional area of the aeroplane is similar to that of the ideal shape, the wave drag of the aeroplane will be similar to that of the ideal shape, irrespective of its actual shape. Wave drag is related to the curvature of the distribution of the volume of an aeroplane. The smoother the curvature the less is the magnitude of the wave drag. Large volumes of the airframe, such as the wings, are usually positioned at the widest part of the fuselage and other necessary features such as the cockpit, the tailplane and engine intakes have to be spread out along the fuselage to maintain the cross-sectional area distribution as near perfect as possible. For transonic aeroplanes it was discovered that indenting the fuselage to produce a waist and adding more volume to the rear of the aeroplane minimised transonic wave drag. Thus, the volume of the fuselage has to be decreased wherever a projection such as the wings and tailplane are positioned so that the cross-sectional area distribution changes smoothly with no discontinuities. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘coke bottle’ effect.",

                "4) these changes start to become significant"
            ],
            "explanation": "As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Figure 1 shows that at low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 2. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2∗W)/(ρ∗S∗CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 3 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

Longitudinal stability is the most commonly affected form of stability. It is determined by movement of the centre of pressure, coupled with changes in the coefficient of lift and the amount of downwash acting on the tailplane. The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under. The exact nature and strength of the changes in trim and stability depend on the design of the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "081.02.03.01.02: Explain how a change in alpha, aeroplane weight, manoeuvres, and centre-of-gravity (CG) position influences MCRIT. When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. The higher the angle of attack of the wing, the higher the speed increase, and therefore the lower the MCRIT. This would come from anything that increases the angle of attack, such as higher weight, or a more forward CG, which acts like increased weight due to the increased downforce from the tailplane. Effectively, bad things for performance such as increased weight or forward CG, cause a bad effect, lower MCRIT, due to increased AoA. Therefore, in this question, the more aft CG will cause a reduction in lift required by the main wing, which will require a lower angle of attack (lower lift coefficient for level flight), and the speed increase over the wing would be lower, so the aircraft can fly faster before getting shockwaves forming, thus a higher MCRIT, which is good.",

Together, these factors will generate a nose-down pitching moment. At high Mach numbers, an aircraft will become unstable with respect to speed; instead of an increasing push force being required as speed increases, a pull force becomes necessary to prevent the aircraft accelerating further. A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment. This unfavorable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

            ],
            "explanation": "LOW SPEED VS. HIGH SPEED STREAMLINE (figure 1) As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. EFFECT OF MACH NUMBER ON CLMAX (figure2) This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2 x W)/(ρ x S x CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. STALLING SPEED vs. ALTITUDE (figure 3) At a constant EAS, Mach number increases as altitude increases. The variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The change in drag characteristics is shown by the CD curve for a basic section at a constant angle of attack in figure 1. The ‘hump’ in the curve from M 0.89 to M 1.2 is caused by: The drag directly associated with the trailing edge shock waves (energy loss). Separation of the boundary layer. The formation of the bow shock wave above M 1.0. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag begins to increase rapidly.

Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Coefficient of Lift (CL) is assumed to remain constant for a particular angle of attack at low subsonic speeds. In high subsonic speeds and the transonic speed regime, the compressibility of the air begins to take effect and, for a particular angle of attack, the coefficient of lift increases. This is because the air cannot \"feel the wing coming\" from as far away (due to it moving so fast), so has to react and get out of the way later. This is more aggressive and gains more lift from the air, but it also removes some of the energy from the air by doing this, and causes a much lower stalling angle of attack, and thereby decreases the CLMAX of the wing overall. This reduced stalling angle of attack is also what causes the low speed buffet boundary to get faster at high altitudes.",

Liquid is an incompressible fluid. A gaseous fluid such as air, on the other hand, can be either compressible or incompressible. Generally, for theoretical and experimental purposes, gases are assumed to be incompressible when they are moving at low speeds (under approximately M0.4). The motion of the object traveling through the air at such speed does not affect the density of the air. This assumption has been useful in aerodynamics when studying the behavior of air in relation to airfoils and other objects moving through the air at slower speeds. However, when aircraft began traveling faster than M0.4, assumptions regarding the air through which they flew that were true at slower speeds were no longer valid. At high speeds some of the energy of the quickly moving aircraft goes into compressing the fluid (the air) and changing its density. The air at higher altitudes where these aircraft fly also has lower density than air nearer to the Earth's surface. The airflow is now compressible, and aerodynamic theories have had to reflect this.",

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. In fluid dynamics, the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number that describes the relative pressures throughout a flow. The increase in pressure due to the compressibility effects created by the presence of shockwaves will lead to an increase in the pressure coefficient.",

An aerofoil generates lift by accelerating air over the top surface. At small angles of attack the highest local velocity on an aircraft will usually be located at the point of maximum thickness on the wing. At increased angles of attack the local velocity will be greater and further forward. Also, if the thickness/chord ratio were greater, the local speed will be higher. Increased thickness/chord ratio and increased angle of attack cause greater accelerations over the top surface of the wing, so the Critical Mach number will decrease with increasing thickness/chord ratio or angle of attack. If we consider two aeroplanes maintaining a constant flight level and flying at the same IAS, one heavier and one lighter, the heavier aeroplane will be flying at a greater AoA in order to maintain a constant flight level. As mentioned above, a higher AofA leads to a higher airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface for the heavier aeroplane, even though both are flying at the same speed. If both aeroplanes accelerate at the same rate, the heavier aeroplane would be the first to get into a situation where the airflow over the upper surface of its wings would locally reach a sonic speed. Therefore, at the same speed, the heavier aeroplane has a lower MCRIT due to the higher AoA. In conclusion: Higher mass = lower MCRIT due to a greater AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed. Lower mass = higher MCRIT due to a smaller AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed.",

The change in drag characteristics is shown by the CD curve for a basic section at a constant angle of attack in figure 1. The ‘hump’ in the curve from M 0.89 to M 1.2 is caused by: The drag directly associated with the trailing edge shock waves (energy loss). Separation of the boundary layer.

            "explanation": "Exceeding the MCRIT speed means that the aircraft is in the transonic speed regime, and that the air going over the wing is becoming supersonic, and therefore forming a shockwave as it reduces back below supersonic speeds. The formation of the shockwave over the wing is the main focus of this question. Transonic effects do cause changes in elevator (pitch) controls due to Mach tuck, but the largest control surface change is the ailerons, as they are mounted on the main wings, and can interact quite badly with the shockwave formation. When ailerons deflect downwards, they change the camber of the wing and cause further acceleration over the wing, which increases the magnitude of the shockwave. The shockwave causes shockwave induced separation behind it on the wing, and this greatly reduces the effect that ailerons can have, as they are trailing edge devices. The worst effect occurs when the section of the wing in front of the ailerons does not yet have a shockwave, so just above MCRIT, when the wing root has formed a shockwave but the thinner section near the wing tip has not. The down-going aileron can increase the camber enough to cause an isolated shockwave in that area, and this can massively reduce the lift from that section of the wing. Of course, that is the exact opposite of the desired effect, as that wing is supposed to be the one with more lift. Therefore, you get a aileron reversal effect, where you ask the aircraft to roll left but it actually rolls to the right. As for the other options: Spoilers are affected by shockwave formation, of course, but as they tend to accelerate the air over them, the shockwave would form right at the back of the spoiler, so they would have at least mostly the desired effect. The rudder is not massively affected by shockwave effects as the fin is very thin in comparison to the wing, and therefore doesn't accelerate the air as much, so shockwaves form much later, and quite evenly on either side of the fin. Flaps should not be used at transonic speeds, for so many reasons.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment.

This shock wave induces flow separation, causing turbulent airflow over the wing and along the fuselage. This turbulent airflow can create airframe buffet, which is felt throughout the aircraft. If the tailplane is aligned with the separated airflow, the turbulent airflow caused by the flow separation can also hit the tail of the aircraft, which may result in a change in the aerodynamic forces acting on the tail and buffet. Option a) \"up wash over the tail, causing a nose down pitching moment.\" is not correct because the flow separation on the wing does not cause upwash over the tail, but rather turbulent airflow and a slight reduction in downwash (naturally, due to the higher airspeed). There will be a nose-down pitching moment around this time, but it is due to the AC moving on the wing and the reduction in downwash, not upwash from the shockwave.",

Longitudinal stability is the most commonly affected form of stability. It is determined by movement of the centre of pressure, coupled with changes in the coefficient of lift and the amount of downwash acting on the tailplane. The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under. The exact nature and strength of the changes in trim and stability depend on the design of the aircraft.",

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. One of the most used methods of increasing MCRIT is to sweep the wing back. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the free stream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Never regard any thunderstorm lightly, even when radar observers report the echoes are of light intensity. Avoiding thunderstorms is the best policy. Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 NM => this general guideline applies even to jet fighters and large airliners. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. • If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. • Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts • Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. “1. Descend to a lower altitude” CORRECT. The AOA of the wing has the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet, or pre-stall buffet, at either the high or low speed boundaries for the airplane. The higher the plane flies, the thinner the air and the greater the AOA required to produce the lift needed to maintain level flight. Increasing the AOA increases the speed of the airflow over the wing and the chances of Mach buffet. “4. Avoid cells by using weather radar” CORRECT. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

All of them involve doing something to change the flow on the upper surface. For example: Increase the leading edge radius, which speeds up the air down. Increase the thickness to chord ratio, which speeds up the air down. As far as the first example, increasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which increases the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given faster acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a slower aircraft speed.",

It is an indication of how fast an aircraft is travelling with relation to the sound waves that surround it. The Mach number may be calculated as follows: M = TAS / LSS LSS is determined by the formula LSS = 38.95 √ T in Kelvin. Hence, when temperature decreases, LSS also declines. With both TAS and LSS experiencing reduction, the Mach Number remains constant. Note: In terms of its impact on True Airspeed (TAS), density (ρ) holds a greater significance compared to temperature. When flying at a constant altitude through a cold air mass, only temperature influences TAS, leading to a decrease. This response aligns with the principles of general gas laws.",

Since CL is a direct function of angle of attack, if angle of attack is increased, MCRIT reduces.

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

Flow separation occurs because the boundary layer loses kinetic energy as it flows against the adverse pressure gradient. Shock wave formation increases the adverse pressure gradient so the loss of kinetic energy in the boundary layer will be greater. Increasing the kinetic energy of the boundary layer will reduce flow separation. Simple devices called vortex generators are used to re-energize the boundary layer. Vortex generators are small plates, vanes, blades, or wedges mounted in spanwise rows along the wing surface. Each vortex generator produces a vortex at its tip which will induce high energy air from the free stream flow to mix with the boundary layer, thus increasing its kinetic energy and helping it flow through the shock wave with much less separation. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. It should be noted that vortex generators may also be used on subsonic aircraft to prevent separation caused by high adverse pressure gradients due to the contours of the surface.",

This unfavorable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted. It is operational at high Mach numbers in the transonic speed range.

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less. At the design stage of an airplane the inclusion of some characteristics will increase the value of the critical Mach number: A thin airfoil cross-section (low thickness to chord ratio). Generally, a thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Therefore, an airfoil with reduced camber will have a higher MCRIT.",

Additionally, the shockwave moves aft as the Mach number increases. Behind the shockwave, the air density increases. The temperature rises, this results in a higher LSS behind the shockwave. Detailed explanation: An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. As seen in figures 2 and 3, at speeds between M0.75 and drag divergence Mach number CL increases. This is due to the pressure distribution over the airfoil resulting from the aft movement of the shockwave.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

            "explanation": "When density altitude decreases, the air gets \"thicker\", meaning that there are more air particles per cubic metre, and therefore more air particles will hit our aircraft and flow over its wings per mile flown. This would increase lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but descend in the atmosphere, the higher air density means that we have to fly slower to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is a decrease in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with decreased altitude. As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with a decrease in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the left, due to the decreased TAS for the same IAS at lower altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 2, moving to the left.",

Given other questions in the database which have been confirmed, we have decided to change the options to make one \"actually correct\", rather than the very questionable previous options, which were never fully verified. This question could have even been removed from EASA's database by now, but we also cannot guarantee that. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect of spoilers on the critical angle of attack is much more complex (and explained where necessary in different questions), and unpredictable, but EASA appear to say that it increases with spoiler deployment (opposite to how it decreases when trailing edge flaps are deployed). As far as we are aware, it could actually increase or decrease slightly in real life, dependent on the wing, spoiler size and location, and particularly the amount of spoiler extension. For this question though, mercifully, the answer remains the same. ANSWERING THE QUESTION The question asks about the angle of attack of the wing. When spoilers are extended, the lift decreases, so without any change to the angle of attack, then the aircraft will no longer be in equilibrium, so in reality, to counteract weight, the angle of attack of the wing has to increase. This agrees with our experience of flying jets, in when we extend spoilers, the aircraft pitches up slightly. The margin to the stall is a very vague term, as it could mean the difference between current speed and stall speed, but it is more likely to mean in terms of angle of attack, and in this case, would probably be the difference between the aircraft's current angle of attack and the critical angle of attack (AoA). When spoilers are extended, the actual AoA is forced to increase to maintain the flight path, and the critical angle of attack will either decrease slightly (according to some other sources) or increase slightly (according to EASA's other questions), but either way, the increase in current AoA will likely be much greater, so the margin to stall will decrease.",

Obviously then, the highest induced drag would occur when at the greatest height above the ground. Ground effect is usually cited as taking effect at approximately half the wingspan of height (which would be 30 ft here), as that is when it becomes significant and noticeable, but as with everything in aerodynamics, it is not a binary effect (on or off), it is a gradual change, so the correct answer here is simply the greatest height.",

CL = the Coefficient of Lift, or the product of aerofoil design (shape) and angle of attack, or relative pressure distribution. In other words, its ability to deflect air, so this can vary between aerofoils. The coefficient will be maximum at, or just before, the stall, which you can see from the formula - if CL increases on one side, the other side (L) will also increase, until lift can no longer be produced. Similarly, reducing speed (V) decreases lift. Thus, to keep the same lift, you must change the angle of attack (CL) if you change speed, and vice versa.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above and left of the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below and right of the origin.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V2) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. A big consideration for this question is the scenario. We are at the critical AoA and we raise the speedbrakes. Of course, we will begin to descend as the drag increases, unless we add thrust. if we don't do either of these things then the aircraft will quickly stall, but initially, assuming the angle of attack remains constant, the speedbrake extension should slightly delay the stall to a higher AoA.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Winglets are small vertical aerofoils that are integrated into the wingtip. These generate a slight forward force and disrupt the airflow from the lower to the upper surface of the wing, diminishing the intensity of the wingtip vortex. Both effects contribute to a reduction in induced drag. Let's examine the remaining options and discuss why they are incorrect: \"Slat extension, at a constant angle of attack and normal extension speeds, will increase the lift coefficient, which will also increase the induced drag coefficient.\" Incorrect. At a constant aircraft angle of attack, the extension of slats decreases the angle of attack on the specific wing section, preventing an increase in the lift coefficient (CL). The advantage of slats becomes evident when the aircraft's angle of attack is subsequently increased. \"Sweepback reduces drag since, compared with a straight wing of equal area, the span increases.\" Incorrect. Sweepback actually reduces the wingspan, thereby lowering the aspect ratio and increasing induced drag. \"Vortex generators on the wing partially block the spanwise flow over the wing, leading to a reduction in induced drag.\" Incorrect. Vortex generators are designed to energize the boundary layer, but they typically contribute to increased drag rather than inducing a reduction in induced drag.",

This can help the aircraft take off with a shortened ground roll, as the aircraft generates more lift at a lower speed with flaps and slats extended. However, flaps and slats shorten the ground roll, but also decrease climb performance as they generate drag. Therefore, after takeoff these two devices are retracted. Flaps and slats both decrease stall speed, but flaps generate much more drag. The flaps are therefore retracted first and slats afterwards. Flaps increase CL for a specific angle of attack, giving a wing with flaps extended a higher CL and therefore higher lift than a wing without. Flaps also increase CLMAX and the CD for a wing, they decrease critical AoA. Slats do not necessarily increase CL for a specific AoA, but they increase the value for CLMAX, meaning that the aircraft stalls at a much higher AoA than normal. They also increase the drag a little on the wing where they are extended. Flaps increase lift, but this question states straight and level flight. If we want to remain in level flight, lift should not be increased because otherwise the aircraft will climb. Therefore the AoA will have to be decreased and the CL will remain the same, drag will increase and CLMAX will be increased. Note: Drag and Lift stay constant. At straight and level flight which means Lift=Weight (constant). IAS is said to have remained constant as well. Remember the lift and drag formula.",

Air comes in under constant pressure (which we will call X from this point onwards) and is directed through the tube. At a certain point in time, the tube starts becoming tighter. However, the same amount of air still has to travel through this (now tighter) tube (we call this airflow Y). It does so by flowing faster than before. This increased airspeed creates a lower pressure at the tighter part of the venturi, while the wider part still has its original pressure and airspeed. After the tightening, the tube becomes wider again and the air returns to its original static pressure and airspeed (airflow Z). It now has the properties of airflow X again. Before the venturi (airflow X) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal In the throat (airflow Y) Total pressure same as airflow X and Z Static Pressure low Speed of the airflow increased After the venturi (airflow Z) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal The venturi works on Bernoulli’s principle. Bernoulli’s principle states that in increase in speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the fluid’s static pressure. The formula for this principle = Total pressure = static pressure + dynamic pressure. If airspeed increases, the static pressure decreases and dynamic pressure increases, keeping total pressure the same.",

This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, the lift decreases when leaving ground effect, and this is more prominent on a low-wing aeroplane where the wings are naturally much closer to the ground.",

In this form, the options are quite vague and we could discuss which is correct for a long time and likely never reach an answer. Therefore, we have used our experience with the authorities to give our \"best guess\" of their correct answer. Obviously, the question could well be better worded in the real exam and with good knowledge of this subject, would likely be much easier to answer. Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, any differences you noticed from our version, and if you have any idea of the correct answer with your exam authority, thank you! Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and improve slow flying characteristics. There are both leading edge devices (LE flaps, kreuger flaps and slats) and trailing edge high lift devices (TE flaps of many kinds). Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly slower, and they do this by increasing the CLMAX of the wings, so that the lift will be enough to counteract weight, even at lower airspeeds. The greater the CLMAX becomes, the lower the stall speed. Secondary effects are increased drag and a change to the wing's chord line and angle of incidence, allowing the aircraft to fly with different pitch attitudes, which can be useful for pilot vision during landing. Let's go through the options now. \"Leading edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than trailing edge flaps because they enhance the wing’s curvature, increasing lift at lower speeds.\" This is not strictly true. Whilst leading edge flaps do enhance the wing's curvature, so do trailing edge flaps, and they both increase the maximum available lift at all speeds. \"Trailing edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than leading edge flaps by increasing the wing area and camber, enhancing lift.\" This is also very difficult to justify, as their increase in CLMAX depends on the TE/LE flaps used and to what degree. Also, not all flaps increase the wing area, only fowler flaps and some variations upon them. Again, TE and LE flaps both increase CLMAX. \"Both leading edge and trailing edge flaps have the same effect on reducing stall speed by equally increasing the wing's lift capabilities.\" For us, this seems most likely to be correct. They both reduce the stall speed by increasing the lifting capability of the wing, allowing the aircraft to fly slower before stalling. \"Equally\" is a bad word to use though, as they could definitely have a different amount of effect, but it is not for us to say if they do, or which is most \"useful\". \"Neither leading edge nor trailing edge flaps significantly reduce the stall speed; they primarily affect the aircraft's drag.\" Obviously incorrect, as they both do significantly reduce the stall speed.",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Since the climb angle is based on thrust and drag: Sin (γ) = (T – D) / W We know that we need to minimize drag as much as possible to get the best climb performance. Therefore lower flaps will be used. High flaps setting usually provide only a slight increase in lift whilst adding a large amount of drag. Approach and landing – The aircraft will be flying again at slow speeds, therefore to increase the safety margin we want a higher CLMAX and therefore a slower stall speed. Secondly, we are in a descent, therefore we can afford to have much more drag than during the departure. Therefore we use a large flap setting which will also create high levels of drag.",

Flaps also change the chord line of the wing, allowing a more nose-down attitude for better pilot visibility and easier landings. Flaps increase lift by increasing the camber of the wing, and often also increasing the wing area, depending on the style of flaps. This helps the aircraft gain more lift for the same airflow. An aircraft only needs enough lift to counteract its own weight in normal operations (and a little more in turns), so there is no need for more lift, only to fly slower, with the same amount of lift. The increased drag also comes from the increased camber and wing area, as this makes the wing less efficient, with a lower lift-to-drag ratio. The steeper the flap angle, the higher the drag they will produce, and this is parasite drag, which increases with the square of the speed. As the aircraft is maintaining the same flight path angle, the lift must remain the same, which removes the answer where lift increases.",

Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed).

To understand it, you must know that it is a way of comparing two objects, and how much drag force acts on them, for a specific size and dynamic pressure. The actual drag force is calculated by the formula D = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x CD x S where D = Drag (N) V = True Airspeed (m/s) CD = Coefficient of Drag S = Wing Area (surface area) (m2) The coefficient of drag is dimensionless, it has no units.

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), but this is not the answer to the question as increased drag is just a side effect, and does not allow us to fly slower without stalling.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The main factors affecting induced drag are wing planform, aspect ratio, speed, and weight/lift. The effect of planform is the principal factor affecting induced drag. The size of the wing tip vortex is directly related to the length of the wing tip chord. A rectangular planform wing produces a much larger vortex than the tapered section. This is because the longer the tip chord, the greater the spillage of air from the lower surface onto the upper surface, and the larger the wing tip vortex. In aerodynamic terms, the elliptical planform wing is the most aerodynamically efficient because the downwash remains constant across the complete wingspan, giving minimal induced drag.",

Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. An increase in CLMAX will reduce the stall speed. LEADING EDGE SLAT A slat is a small auxiliary aerofoil attached to the leading edge of the wing. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed, the boundary layer is re-energized. The effect of the slat is to prolong the lift curve by delaying boundary layer separation until a higher angle of attack. The magnitude of the increase to CLMAX and the extent of the decrease to the stalling speed are directly proportional to the length of the leading edge of the aerofoil covered by the slat and the chord of the slat itself, i.e. the longer the slat the greater the CLMAX and the lower the stalling speed.",

Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Ice will lead to sooner separation, smaller stalling angle of attack, therefore causing a lower CLMAX. Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

The arm is the distance of the CP from a specified position. As the CP moves with the changing angle of attack, the moment about a point will also change as the angle of attack changes. On a cambered aerofoil even though the centre of pressure (CP) moves with the changing angle of attack, the lift is assumed to act through the aerodynamic centre (AC). The combination of the AC and the pitching moment coefficient are required for the analysis of the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. The tailplane is a major contributor to the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. To maintain a particular angle of attack a specific deflection of the elevator is established that will maintain this requirement. Thus, the movement of CP has an effect on both the pitching moment and stabilizer movement.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The vortices induce downwash to the airflow behind the wing, causing the lift vector to tilt rearward. The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π * AR Where, CDI– Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Decreasing the speed of an aircraft maintaining straight and level flight will increase its angle of attack and therefore increase the CL. It is true that CL is inversely proportional to speed. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared.

The importance of maximum lift coefficient is that the greater the CLMAX, the lower the minimum flight speed (stall speed). If an aerofoil section of greater camber is used to give a lower minimum flight speed, the efficient cruise speed will be lower due to o the generation of excessive drag. It is better to use an aerofoil section that is efficient at high cruise speed, with the ability to temporarily increase the camber of the wing when it is necessary to fly slowly. In the figure is also dipected that the CL increases with increasing Angle of Attack until the point of CLMAX, where an increase in Angle of Attack leads to a decrease in CL. In this exercice there are two airfoils: - airfoil 1 and 2 are identical, with airfoil 2 at a higher angle of attack - airfoil 3 and 4 are identical, with airfoil 4 at a higher angle of attack Airfoil 1 and 2 have a higher thickness and camber when compared to airfoil 3 and 4. From this we can conclude that: - Airfoil 3 is producing the least CL as it has the least camber, thickness and angle of attack; - Airfoil 4 produces more CL than airfoil 3 because it has a higher angle of attack - Airfoil 1 prduces more CL than the previous ones due to its camber and thickness - Airfoil 2 produces the most CL because of its camber, thickness and higher angle of attack. Knowing this, we can select the correct option: 3, 4, 1, 2.",

As for the other options, the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass. That is the point through which the weight force acts. The aerodynamic centre is a bit more complicated, as it is a point on a wing (aerofoil) where the turning force of the aerodynamic forces around it remains the same, usually at around 25% chord for subsonic flow.

Broadly speaking, downwash is the downwards angle that air has after interacting with the wing. The wing produces lift by forcing a large amount of air downwards, to push the aircraft upwards. Downwash can also be the change in airflow angle that wingtip vortices cause, but we don't think the question is referring directly to that. When flaps are extended, the aircraft can fly slower without stalling as the reduced airflow over the wing is being forced downwards at a steeper angle, which means the downwash angle increases, which means it still produces as much lift as the clean wing at higher speeds. This downwash can have a strong effect on the airflow hitting the horizontal stabiliser though, causing an increase pitch up moment on some aircraft, with the effect varying in strength, depending on where their wings and stabilisers are mounted.",

            "explanation": "A plane can remain in the air by the wings generating lift. If this lift is equal to the weight (and the aircraft is in the air), the aircraft will remain in level flight. A wing operates through the principle of pressure differential and equal and opposite reactions. An aerofoil segment can generate lift by either having an angle of attack to the relative airflow, or but being cambered (bulging more in one direction), or both. Both these things mean that, to create lift upwards, the air flowing over the top of the wing must travel faster than the air underneath the wing, in order to provide a low pressure area above the wing due to the venturi effect. The way this occurs can be thought of through many different approaches, but it is easiest for our purposes just to say that the streamlines of air going over the wing get squashed together more than those under the wing (there is a little more to it, but we don't want to make it any more complex). The venturi effect creates a low pressure area above the wing, and the relatively higher pressure beneath the wing means that there is a net force upwards on the wing (from high to low), which is our lift. The air behind the wing is also given some downwash by this effect, and that satisfies the \"equal and opposite forces\" of Newton's 3rd law, in that the air going downwards forces the aircraft to go upwards. It is important to know that the low pressure air is the main contributor to the lifting effect, and not the \"high\" pressure beneath the wing, as that is only high relative to the low, not relative to ambient pressure.",

            "explanation": "Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Additional Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed the boundary layer is re-energised. If Kinetic Energy is added to the boundary layer, boundary layer separation will be delayed to a much higher angle of attack. In terms of the pressure distribution of the aerofoil with a slat extended, the slat provides a fair amount of lift itself due to its shape, and when extended, it flattens the peak of the low pressure zone somewhat, allowing the low pressure zone to be more evenly distributed over the top of the aerofoil. It increases the suction overall as it allows a much higher critical AoA and higher CLMAX, as the adverse pressure gradient occurs more gradually, delaying the stall. Furthermore, the suction peak flattens, it does not move. This is why the CL location does not change very much when extending flaps. Note: We are aware that the wording of the correct option here is a little off regarding the suction peak, as the peak should reduce, but the overall suction increases. We think this could be what the examiner is trying to say. We still think it is the most correct option by far out of the available options, but please send us any further feedback if you see this question in the exam, thank you!",

This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50%. Lift (CLMAX) The larger the angle of attack, the larger the decrease of CL with a maximum decrease at CLMAX Drag More skin friction drag results in overall more drag and earlier boundary layer separation. In significant icing condition, ice build-up can also increase the form or pressure drag Stall Speed Due to decrease of CLMAX and increase of the aircraft weight, stall speed will increase. Critical Angle of Attack Increased surface friction results in quicker flow separation. This reduces the critical angle of attack and a stall will occur sooner. Stability The decreased CLMAX of the tailplane could cause a stal when the aircraft is flying at low speed and with an increased downwash due to flap extension. A tailplane stall will result in loss of longitudinal control. The changed CL of the main wing will create some small changes in the pitching moment.",

            "explanation": "Camber is the asymmetry between two acting surfaces on an airfoil. For an aircraft, this is the top and the bottom of the wing. Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

Typical aspect ratios vary from 35 for a high-performance sailplane to as low as 3 for a jet fighter. The aspect ratio of a modern high-speed jet transport is about 12. Aspect Ratio is the measure of Span divided by Chord. As many wing planforms have variable chord lengths, there is a second formula which uses wing area instead, which effectively just makes use of the \"average chord\". AR = b/c or, AR = b2 /S Where: AR - Aspect Ratio b - Span c - Average Chord S - Wing Area Therefore, for this wing, the aspect ratio can be calculated in a few different ways. The easiest is to just to say that the average chord is 1.25 m, and span / chord = 12.5 / 1.25 = 10. Alternatively, you can calculate the wing area as two trapeziums (or any other way) as 2 x 6.25 x ((1 + 1.5) / 2) which gets you to 15.625 m2, and then do span2 / wing area, which is 12.52 / 15.625 = 10.",

            "explanation": "The polar diagram of CL vs CD is a very common one to be used in the exams. It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. We can therefore imagine what each of the options would do to the graph, and measure that up with the annex in the question. \"Flaps\" Flaps increase our CLMAX and also increase drag, so the graph would move up and to the right, which is not the same as the annex. \"Landing Gear\" Landing Gear won't affect our lift, but they will increase drag, so the graph will move to the right only, not downwards like we see in the annex. \"Lift dumpers\" Lift dumpers such as wing spoilers reduce lift (as per their name) by ruining the airflow over the wing, and increase drag through this very same method, and by putting an obstruction in the airflow. They would cause the graph to go down and to the right, which matches up with the annex. \"Slats\" Slats allow an increase in the CLMAX as they allow for higher angles of attack to be flown, but they do not increase drag by very much, so the graph would move upwards, with perhaps a slight movement to the right near the top.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "For a fixed wing aircraft, ground effect is the increased lift and decreased drag that the wings generate when they are close to the ground. Upon landing, ground effect can give the effect of floating. The stall speed may be temporarily reduced due to ground effect. Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground. This means that the aircraft needs a lower angle of attack for a certain amount of lift. This results in lower induced drag (decreasing induced angle of attack).",

Their main purpose us to increase the leading edge camber, which delays separation and in so increases the stall angle and corresponding CLMAX. Their main contribution is to increase the maximum lift coefficient, but not increase the lift coefficient at a certein AoA. The negative influence of extending slats is a slight increase in drag. Therefore we can say that at a certain AoA, slats will not increase lift, but they will increase drag slightly, therefore the only resultant moment will be a yaw. Flaps are aerodynamic surfaces that extended from the trailing edge of the wing. Their main purpose is to increase the camber of the wing to increase the coefficient of lift for a certain AoA. This can be seen on the figure. Their main contribution to the wing is extra lift. Whilst drag is also a side effect, lift it more significant. Therefore the correct answer is: “slat asymmetry causes a yawing moment, whereas flap asymmetry causes a large rolling moment.”",

We also require as much feedback from the real exam as possible to try and make this question more accurate, so please do let us know if you see this question, and anything you can remember from it, thank you. When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its induced drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus upwash and downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash/Upwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash/Upwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. (So the AoA increases to maintain lift) The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. In terms of the forces on the controls, it's a tricky one to answer. The forces will change on the elevators as elevators feel the reduced downwash behind the main wings when in ground effect, giving a pitch down moment, so a pitch-up moment is expected upon leaving the ground effect. However, this is not \"lighter\" or \"heavier\" controls. We believe that there is no consistent change, but please let us know if this is marked as incorrect in the exam and we can look into changing this. The learning objectives do not mention this, but they are also quite vague on this matter so do not remove it completely.",

Parasite drag increases with the square of the speed, induced drag changes with the inverse square of the speed (highest at low speeds). Together, they create the familiar drag curve of an aircraft. Sometimes, we have to convert that graph again, from drag (thrust required) to something more friendly to propeller aircraft. Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; the power required curve will look almost the same (There is a slight flat section of figure 2 but it is not important, imagine it looks the same as the others), but for each point on the curve, the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards).

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that arrow 3 is correct. Although the lift is the larger force, the proportional increase in the drag is greater, and so the maximum lift/drag ratio decreases.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. These are obviously where the air is hitting the aircraft, and therefore some of the SCWDs will hit the airframe. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example. When it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warning that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

In the sense that increasing the angle of attack increases the wing's coefficient of lift in a mostly linear fashion, up until the critical angle of attack, when the wing stalls and any further increase in angle of attack causes a steep drop-off in lift coefficient. There is a graph to show this relationship, the CL vs Alpha (AoA) graph. The X-axis of the graph is the angle of attack (AoA) (α - Greek letter Alpha), and when the AoA is zero, a symmetrical aerofoil will not have any lift (well more precisely, it has both upwards and downwards lift of equal amounts which cancel out). However, a positively cambered aerofoil will produce some lift at zero degrees angle of attack, depending on how much camber is present. The Y-axis of the graph is the coefficient of lift (CL). This means that the graph for a symmetrical aerofoil will go straight through the origin, as 0º AoA = 0 lift, so CL = 0. A positively cambered aerofoil will have some lift at 0º AoA, so will have a line that crosses the Y axis above the origin. In this question, then, a symmetrical aerofoil's CL vs Alpha graph will cross the Y-axis and X-axis at the same point, so the question is asking about the origin of the graph, which means zero lift is being produced at that point.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

            "explanation": "Note: Beware of the difference between lift force distribution and coefficient of lift distribution. Questions like this one have never been asked about before to our knowledge, so read the following explanation to understand the difference. The planform of a wing is a fancy way of saying the shape of the wing when looked on from above. Wings can be made in many different planforms, which all have different properties, ranging from their spanwise lift distributions to their stall characteristics, transonic flight characteristics, ease of construction, etc. Spanwise lift distribution is exactly as it sounds. It refers to the lift produced by each point on the wing, running laterally from the root to the tip. The simplest wing, a rectangular wing, has a spanwise lift distribution that is mostly flat, but drops off near the tip. This is not the most efficient planform for creating lift, as the high lift near to the tip (before the drop off) causes strong vortices, which cause induced drag. An elliptical planform, however, is much more efficient when it comes to induced drag. An elliptical planform wing has much lower induced drag due to its shape, and the spanwise distribution of the lift force starts higher, and has a more gradual drop off towards the tip. This means that much smaller wingtip vortices are formed, as there is not much lift being created around the tip. (see bottom figure in annex Now an elliptical wing is sometimes said to have a \"flat\" lift distribution, but that is referring to the coefficient of lift. The coefficient of lift of an elliptical wing stays almost constant along the whole span of the wing (top figure in annex), but because the actual chord line of the wing becomes gradually shorter towards the tip, the lift force decreases (as per the lift equation, where chord length directly influences wing area [S]). There are a few more complex reasons why this is so good for reducing induced drag, but we are not going to go into them. We are frankly surprised that the examiner has gone this far into the technicalities of wing planforms, as they have previously used greater oversimplifications.",

Wings with deflected flaps usually stall at a lower AoA than wings without flaps. This is due to the fact that the pressure gradients at the CL max for both cases are roughly equal.

Please let us know if you see this in the exam so we can verify it, as well as which authority you sat your exam under, thank you! The centre of pressure of a wing (aerofoil) is dictated by the pressure layout around the wing. This pressure layout changes dramatically depending on the shape, angle of attack, and speed of the relative airflow. The centre of pressure is kind of the \"average\" point of the pressure layout, where the sum of all the pressures acts through on the aerofoil. It is therefore the point through which the lift and drag act. It moves, depending on the angle of attack of a wing. For a positively cambered (normal) aerofoil in standard flight, the CP moves further towards the leading edge as the angle of attack increases, up until the stall. The aerodynamic centre is slightly more complex. When you add up all the forces on an aerofoil, there will be a resultant force through the centre of pressure, and this is split into lift and drag. The centre of pressure will not have any turning force around it, only forces acting directly through it. However, every other point on the wing will have a force acting around it, imagine holding the leading edge of an aerofoil in a wind tunnel, not only would it try and pull away from you, but it would also try to twist due to these moments. There is a point where the moments (turning forces around that point) stay the same, no matter the angle of attack (for the same IAS). This is called the aerodynamic centre, and it does not move (for a range of normal angles of attack and in the low subsonic speed regime). As you can see from the figure, the CP is behind the AC, and for normal ranges of flight, this will be the case.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE The strength and size of the vortices produced by an aeroplane are dependent on the amount of lift produced. Strong vortices are produced by large transport aeroplanes that create a significant amount of turbulence behind the aeroplane along the path of the aircraft. The disturbance so caused can extend for a considerable distance and last for several minutes. This is wake turbulence that can seriously affect the controllability of following aeroplanes if they are too close. The severity of the turbulence so created is categorised to enable following pilots to assess the difficulties that may be encountered. The larger, heavier aeroplanes create the worst turbulence that will cause problems to following pilots particularly when close to the ground during take-off or landing. Pilots are advised by the aviation authorities of the minimum distance and/or time separation from the aeroplane ahead deemed to be safe, to avoid having control problems. The minimum separation distance and/or time is based on the relative sizes of the aeroplanes concerned. Wake turbulence is affected by the height of the aeroplane and the prevailing wind conditions. The downwash of the airflow behind the aeroplane causes the vortices to descend to one thousand feet below the aeroplane. However, at low height, when the aeroplane is in ground effect, the vortices move outward from the path of the aeroplane over the ground. But any cross wind between 5 kt and 10 kt will prevent this happening to the upwind vortex and will keep it on the aircraft’s track. It is particularly important during the take-off phase that the following aircraft complies with the advised separation because of this. Aircraft mass, speed, aspect ratio and trailing-edge flap setting influence the strength of the vortices. The vortex strength is greatest for heavy aeroplanes at low airspeed and in the clean configuration, which is just after rotation at take-off. Vortices only cease when the nose-wheel touches down during landing ground run.",

From figure 1, we can then conclude that sections with smaller area have an increase in speed. These areas are also where streamlines appear closer together. This can be used to make an analogy with an airfoil where streamlines are enclosed into a streamtube (figure 2).

On many flap control systems, the deflection on the two sides is compared while the flaps are moving, and if one side should fail, movement on the other side is automatically stopped. On less sophisticated systems, a failure of the operating mechanism could lead to an asymmetric situation, known as flap asymmetry. The difference in lift will cause a rolling moment, which must be opposed by the ailerons, and the difference in drag will cause a yawing moment, which must be opposed by the rudder.

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtipsand become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared.

The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow.

So, the total power required curve moves up and slightly to the right and the VMP moves to the right.",

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 has significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0° AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber. We can assume from the question text that the other lines represent different configurations of the same aerofoil, so our answer is symmetrical aerofoil with trailing edge flaps extended.",

In practice, they increase critical angle of attack as well. When the aircraft is at lower angles of attack (i.e. 5 degrees) the diagram shows that deployment of Trailing Edge (TE) flaps increases CL by much more than LE devices. This is because TE flap deployment increases local alpha, whereas LE devices reduce local alpha on the part of the wing where they are deployed. However, CL is still boosted a little, because LE devices increase camber and also increase the mass flow over the upper surface of the wing. This means that the airflow over the top of the wing has more kinetic energy, and the forward movement of the separation point at high alpha will be delayed. Therefore, we can increase AOA and CL beyond the point at which airflow over the wing without LE devices would have separated and we would stall. LE devices enable aircraft alpha to increase to a higher value before the stall, at which point CLMAX has a higher value than when TE flaps are deployed.",

Lift = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x CL x S Where; ρ = Air Density, V = Velocity (true air speed), CL = Coefficient of Lift, S = Wing Area. To use the formula above, we need everything in the correct units. That means that we have to convert the velocity (TAS) from knots into m/s. As 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour, we have to multiply by the amount of metres in a nautical mile (1852) and then divide by the amount of seconds in an hour (3600). Velocity = 73 kt x 1852/3600 = 37.55 m/s We are going to rearrange the formula to find the CL, and that means we need to have a value for the lift produced by the wing. As we are in straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, so we just need the weight of the aircraft. Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity (G). Therefore; Lift = Weight = 7300 x 9.81 = 71613 N Referring to the rearranged equation in the annex above; CL = (2 x 71613) / (1.225 x (37.55)2 x 49) = 1.69",

The other part is to establish a relationship between induced drag and speed. From the graph attached to this explanation, we can conclude that an increase in speed leads to an decrease in induced drag. If you refer to the second attached figure, we can conclude how the Effective Airflow, Effective Angle of Attack, and Induced Drag behave: Wing tip vortices create certain vertical velocity components in the airflow in the vicinity of the wing, both in front of and behind it. These vertical velocities strengthen upwash and downwash, which reduce the effective angle of attack. The stronger the vortices, the greater the reduction in effective angle of attack. The effective angle of attack is the actual or effective angle of attack at the aerofoil. In level flight at a given mass the lift generated is the same at all forward speeds above the stalling speed. Because the angle of attack must decrease with increasing speed the same downwash speed has less effect at a high speed than it does at a low forward speed because it has a smaller downwash vector. Thus, the downwash angle is less at higher speeds than it is at lower forward speeds. Therefore, the induced drag is decreased at high speeds.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases.

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. The CL/CD ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore the highest value of the CL/CD ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

This updraft turn into a downdraft behind the wing, creating a vortex. The higher the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the wing, the stronger the vortices. This question is specifically asking for: Angle of attack: The strength of the vortices (and therefore also induced drag) is proportional to the angle of attack. Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct! Aspect ratio: The strength of the vortices is inversely proportional with the aspect ratio. Meaning that the strength of the wing tip vortices increase as the aspect ratio decreases. And vice versa: the strength decreases as the aspect ratio increases. Therefore statement 2 is correct!",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane.",

Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber.

Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective.

Please do inform us in the comments if you see this question, and also if you have any further feedback to add, thank you! Learning Objective 081.01.04.02.01: Describe the general streamline pattern around the wing, tail section, and fuselage. Learning Objective 081.01.04.02.02: Explain and describe the causes of spanwise flow over top and bottom surfaces. The streamlines of air around an aeroplane just depict the path that air particles take past the aircraft in flight, so primarily front to back, and they have to move out of the way of the aircraft's fuselage, wings, tail fin, engine nacelles, etc. Any time streamlines converge (come together), the air accelerates and the static pressure drops, and any time they diverge (get further apart), the airspeed drops and the static pressure rises, which brings about pressure distributions, lift and drag forces on the aircraft. 2 dimensional streamlines around the wing cross-section are shown in the first image above, but this question is certainly asking about 3 dimensional airflow, and that gets more complicated. The main area of 3D airflow is spanwise flow over the wings and wingtip vortices, which are effectively the same thing. Because wings are not infinitely long, there has to be a wingtip somewhere, and high pressure air from under the wing can cheat the system by going round the tip and getting to the upper wing surface. as streamlines of air affect the other nearby streamlines, this means that the air under the wing has a \"spanwise\" flow outwards, and the air on top of the wing has a spanwise flow inwards. When these two flows meet at the rear of the wing, they swirl around each other, causing vortices, strongest at the wingtip and getting weaker towards the wing root. This creates a familiar wingtip vortex area as shown above. Now for the answers. None of them are very good so we have chosen the best in our opinion as the correct one. \"The streamlines typically follow the direction of the lateral axis of the aeroplane and remain attached along the entire length of the aeroplane.\" Definitely incorrect. The lateral axis goes from left to right, and the streamlines go from front to back. \"The streamlines typically follow the contours of the fuselage, but they will have a slight spanwise flow producing a lift-like force.\" Likely incorrect. They do indeed follow the contours of the fuselage, but \"spanwise flow\" means from left to right, because it is along the wingspan, and this doesn't really hold true for fuselage airflow, and doesn't really produce any such lift-like force that we can think of. \"On the entire aft section of the fuselage, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Maybe incorrect. This one depends on the wording, but worded like this, we would say it is incorrect. A corkscrew pattern around the entire aft section of the fuselage sounds like what happens behind a nose-mounted propeller, but that wasn't specified in the question. Wingtip vortices (which we suspect are the purpose of the question) cause two vortices, spiralling in opposite directions, and stray far from the aft fuselage. \"Across the entire wingspan of the main wings, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Best answer here. The 3 dimensional flow around the wings does make somewhat of a corkscrew pattern, and it is completely because of the wingtip vortex for that wing. The spanwise component of the flow is much greater near the wingtip and very little near the wing root, but it is still there nonetheless, and after the wing becomes very much \"corkscrew-like\".",

This is the \"flow back\" ice that one of the correct statements mentions. It covers over the aerofoil and changes the shape, sometimes quite dramatically. This will decrease the critical angle of attack, and therefore the stalling speed in level flight will increase. Icing of the pitot and static ports is also a problem when dealing with icing conditions. This is why pitot and static probes are heated, to avoid any such issues. If they do become iced over, the pilots may find it difficult to know what airspeed they are flying at, and therefore may be unsure of their angle of attack, which can lead to an unexpected stall.",

The same increase of CL could have been made by increasing the angle of attack, but this might have brought the aircraft close to or past the stalling angle of attack, so flaps might be the best choice. Some may wonder why answer A, \"The new CL is greater than 0.38 because flaps always increase the CL.\", is not correct. It is because flaps do not always increase the CL. If we remain at the same AoA and add flaps, the CL will almost always increase, but this is rarely what we do. If we added flaps but remained at the same speed, and at the same altitude, the CL would stay the same, as none of the components in the Lift equation would have changed. We would then be flying at a lower angle of attack, though, and with higher drag.",

            "explanation": "GROUND EFFECT When an aeroplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low-wing aeroplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect, which is only experienced for conventional aeroplanes during the initial climb phase after take-off and the final descent phase during landing. At low airspeeds it is considered that the air is non compressible and, because of the close proximity of the earth’s surface, the upwash of air ahead of the wing is reduced. Thus, because of the diminished negative lift, the downwash over the upper surface of the wing does not have to be as large as it would be normally. This enables the aeroplane to maintain level flight at a lower than usual angle of attack, which decreases the induced drag and improves the efficiency of the wing. The consequences of operating in ground effect at a constant IAS are: - Decreased upwash and downwash angles produce smaller wing-tip vortices. - Increased Cl. - Significantly decreased induced drag coefficient; by approximately 8% at a height equal to half wingspan and reduced by considerably more at any lower height. - Decreased total drag (no effect on parasite drag). - Decreased angle of attack for a given lift coefficient. - Increased angle of attack for a constant IAS. - Decreased stalling angle of attack. - Decreased induced angle of attack. - Increased lift, if the pitch attitude remains constant. - Increased speed for a constant thrust setting. - Increased float distance on landing, if the angle of attack is constant, increasing the total landing distance. - The lift vector is inclined forward, which decreases the thrust required. - Less thrust and power are required to fly at the same speed.",

Please send us any further exam feedback you have, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The figure shows 4 types of flaps: Plain flap -The standard for many light aircraft, increases available lift and increases drag. Easy to manufacture Slotted flap - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft. So from those descriptions, we can definitely see that type 2 (slotted) flaps have a much larger available CL than type 1 (plain) flaps with less drag.",

            "explanation": "Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The vortices induce downwash to the airflow behind the wing, causing the lift vector to tilt rearward. The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. It is advantageous to reduce induced drag to a minimum, and this is achieved using the following design features to minimize the formation of wing tip vortices: Tapering the wing in planform toward the tip reduces the amount of air flowing from the lower surface to the upper surface, thereby reducing the size of the wing tip vortex. Washout means constructing the wing with a small amount of twist from root to tip, so that the inboard wing section is at a higher angle of incidence, and hence a greater angle of attack, compared to the wing tip. This ensures that the inner part of the wing generates most of the lift, thus minimizing the leakage of airflow around the wing tips. This reduces the size of the wing tip vortex and reduces the total amount of induced drag. Wing tip modifications reduce the leakage of airflow around the wing tip and limit the size of the vortex. Some of the more typical designs include winglets, wing tip fence and wing tip tank.",

            "explanation": "Wing tip vortices increase if we increase induced drag. This can be caused by for example increased speed, density or lift coefficient. If we decrease Angle of Attack, lift will be decreased, also decreasing the strength of wing tip vortices. This shows that statement I is incorrect. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square od the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. Statement number II is incorrect, as the correct answer would be “The strength of wing tip vortices increases as the aspect ratio decreases.",

These forces must be in equilibrium during flight. Lift must balance weight and thrust must balance drag. These forces are Lift is defined by: L = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x S x CL For a given wing area (S), if the altitude (i.e. air density) and mass remain constant then the remaining factors in the formula, the coefficient of lift (CL) and the free air velocity (IAS), are variable but have a fixed relationship. CL and IAS must change in such a manner that the total lift formula remains balanced. Lift coefficient increases with angle of attack up to a maximum (CLMAX), which corresponds to the “Critical” angle of attack. Continuing to increase the angle of attack beyond this point makes it impossible for the airflow to maintain its previous smooth flow over the contour of the upper surface, and lift will reduce. This is represented in figure 2. At a constant mass and altitude, if the IAS is increased, the angle of attack must be decreased to maintain level flight otherwise the aeroplane will climb.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. We have therefore based this answer on feedback and other questions such as 819930 and 815643, but recent feedback is scarce, so please let us know if this is different if you see it in the real exam, thank you!",

In this case, mass (m) is 1400 kg and the acceleration of gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s2: W = 1400 x 9.8 = 13720 N Another factor we need to consider is that the unit for speed in this formula is m/s and not knots. We must, therefore, convert 70 kt to m/s. Knowing that 1 kt = 0,5144 m/s: 70 kt x 0,5144 m/s = 36,008 m/s All we have left to do is reorganise the Lift formula in order to obtain the value of CL. CL = (2 x W) ÷ (V2 x ρ x S) CL = (2 x 13720) ÷ (36.0082 x 1.225 x 13.5) CL = 1.28",

The use of flaps on take-off is to allow the aircraft to maintain flight at lower speeds, therefore using less runway whilst accelerating. After take-off, the flaps just increase the aircraft's drag, so reduce the climb capability of the aircraft. Therefore, quite early into the take-off climb, the pilots will retract the flaps, in order to accelerate further and reduce drag. If the flaps are retracted too early, the aircraft may not be flying fast enough to gain sufficient lift with a clean wing, and the aircraft will therefore stall. If the flaps are retracted too late, the aircraft may accelerate past the VFE for that flap setting (maximum speed with flaps extended). Therefore, in this question, where the pilot monitoring has retracted the flaps prematurely (early), there is a potential for the aircraft to be below the new VS, thereby stalling the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback has been a bit contradictory for this question, and it seems very new to the EASA database. Please let us know if you see this question in the exam, and anything you can remember about it. Thank you! The effect of flaps on Take-off Distance (TOD) is as follows: Initially, increasing flap setting (from no flaps) reduces the take-off distance quite significantly as the aircraft can lift-off at a lower speed, reducing the Take-Off Run. The higher the flap setting though, the longer the distance from the lift-off point to reach the screen height, due to more drag. At a certain point though, the extra drag of high flap settings becomes a problem, as the aircraft will require a little more distance to accelerate and much more distance to reach the screen height. This extra distance eventually outweighs the small reduction in lift-off speeds when using high flap settings. The trick with this question is to note that there will be a peak flap setting that provides the minimum TOD, and the manufacturer is likely to make this the maximum allowed flap setting for take-off (if not even a lower flap setting). There is effectively no reason to ever need to take-off with flaps above this setting, and single engine climb gradient would likely be much more limiting by this point anyway. Therefore, it is our opinion that the correct answer is \"Decreases, because the effect on lift-off speed is more significant than the extra drag created.\" Remember, the examiner is asking about a take-off with the maximum allowed take-off flap setting, not full flaps. It is possible the examiner may be actually asking about very high flap settings here, in which case, the answer will change to one that states that the distance increases as the extra drag outweighs the lower lift-off speed, but for now, we think that is not the purpose of this question, and if so, would require an appeal due to incorrect wording.",

Therefore, if dynamic pressure increases then static pressure decreases and vice versa. If the static pressure on one side of a body is reduced more than on the other side, a pressure differential will exist. The actual pressure distribution over the upper and lower surfaces varies with changes in angle of attack, as does the pressure differential and the amount of lift developed. As the angle of attack increases, the low pressure above the aerofoil deepens and the suction peak moves forward. This results in the lift increasing and more of the lift being generated further forward. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, increasing the angle of attack increases CL, which increases Induced drag.",

Upon landing, ground effect can give the effect of floating. The stall speed may be temporarily reduced due to ground effect. Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground. This means that the aircraft needs a lower angle of attack for a certain amount of lift. This results in lower induced drag (decreasing induced angle of attack).",

Ailerons produce adverse yaw, which is where the down-going aileron increases the camber of the wing, and acts similar to a flap, increasing lift, as it is supposed to, but also increasing drag. The up-going aileron reduces the wing camber, reducing drag. This causes an unwanted yaw towards the upward-going wing during a bank. Ailerons can also be affected by the twisting of a wing at high speeds, in an effect known as high speed aileron reversal. Adverse yaw from ailerons can be counteracted in a fe different ways: Roll spoilers. Frise ailerons. Differential ailerons. Roll spoilers are the subject of this question. Spoilers are aerodynamic devices that stick out of the top of a wing, giving a loss of lift similar to an up-going aileron and an increased drag similar to a split flap. They are used on almost all modern commercial jets. When spoilers are used as \"roll spoilers\", they are a primary flight control. They assist or replace the ailerons on the down-going wing by increasing drag and reducing lift. They use this increased drag to even out the drag of the down-going ailerons on the opposite wing, reducing or removing adverse aileron yaw.",

It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. Wing tip modifications reduce the leakage of airflow around the wing tip and limit the size of the vortex. WINGLETS These are small vertical aerofoils which form part of the wing tip. Shaped and angled to the induced airflow, they generate a small forward force. Winglets partly block the air flowing from the bottom to the top surface of the wing, reducing the strength of the tip vortex.",

Please do let us know in the comments if you see this question in your exams, and any similarities or differences you remember about it, thank you very much. When flying outside of ground effect, wingtip vortices change the effective airflow around a wing by providing downwash behind the wing. This means that the effective airflow over the wing actually comes from slightly above where the relative airflow is ( This change in angle, where the angle of attack is split into the effective AoA (αe) and the induced AoA (αi) means that the lift from the wing is pointing very slightly rearwards, and that component becomes what we call induced drag. The induced angle of attack (αi) is the angle of attack that is lost due to the effect of wingtip vortices. When entering ground effect, the downwash caused by the wingtip vortices has nowhere to go, as the ground is in the way, so the induced angle of attack is much reduced, and more of the total angle of attack is effective angle, which increases the lift of the wing and reduces the drag significantly. This effect is greatest at the wing tip as that is where the wingtip vortices effect the most.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

We have recently made a small wording change that we believe might correspond closer to the exam, and this has changed the \"correct answer\".

We can assume that \"the pilot rotates the aircraft at the correct speed and rate\" means that the pilot rotates at the VR that was calculated, and at the correct rate of rotation for a clean airframe. The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will modify the profile of the aerofoil, increase the roughness of the aircraft surface as well as increasing the weight of the aircraft. This reduction in lift and increase in drag drastically affects the flying characteristics of the aircraft. The biggest problem in this scenario is that the disturbance of the airflow causes the wing to stall at a much lower angle of attack, hence the wing has a much lower critical angle of attack, due to the ice accretion. As this is the take-off rotation, the aircraft is very quickly increasing its angle of attack, and the ice accretion could mean that it quickly passes through the angles of attack that produce lift, and past the critical angle of attack. This means that the aircraft is accelerating down the runway with a nose-up attitude, but the wings are stalled so no lift is created. Icing or any other type of contaminant does definitely NOT increase the angle of maximum CL. Any contamination degrades aerodynamic performance, by increasing Drag and decreasing Lift and ultimately by DECREASING the angle for maximum CL. As we mentioned above, this is a terrible question, and this is just one interpretation of it, so be careful whilst reading it if you get it in the exam.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin (and generates 0 lift at a negative angle of attack). A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. If we add flaps to the clean configuration, CL will increase, but so will the drag. This degrades glide performance. The rate of descent will increase and glide range will decrease.",

            "explanation": "DOWNWASH Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow. It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the exact same thing, but there are subtle differences to how we view it in different contexts as part of the syllabus. Evaluating all possible meanings, the only correct answer is \"stronger wingtip vortices\". INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, some air tries to \"cheat\" the wing and travel around the wingtip, creating wingtip vortices that affect the lift of the rest of the wing. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. These vortices create upwash in front of the wing and downwash behind the wing, effectively changing the local relative airflow, and therefore changing the effective angle of attack of the wing. This produces inefficiencies and means the wing's lift is produced at an angle, and some of the lift turns into drag, called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The stronger the wingtip vortices, the greater the downwash behind the wing. As part of producing a lifting force on the aircraft, a wing must force air to go downwards, to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion (equal and opposite reactions). This is referred to as downwash also, and means that the air flowing away from a wing is pointing slightly downwards, but it arrived at the wing perfectly horizontal, for instance. The amount of \"downwash\" is directly proportional to the lift produced, and therefore: Decreased lift produces less downwash. Increased dynamic pressure means higher airspeed, but has no effect on the magnitude of lift, and therefore downwash, and will actually decrease the angle of the downwash, due to more air flowing over the wing for the same lift force. This is assuming the same lift force, which we see as much more realistic than assuming a constant angle of attack or lift coefficient, etc., for these questions. Entering ground effect reduces the effect of wingtip vortices, making the wing more efficient, due to the reduced downwash (as the air cannot flow down as much due to the ground in the way).",

The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π*AR Where, CDI – Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, decreasing the angle of attack decreases CL, which decreases Induced drag.

Please send us any further exam feedback you have, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The figure shows 4 types of flaps: Plain flap -The standard for many light aircraft, increases available lift and increases drag. Easy to manufacture Slotted flap (and multiple slotted flaps) - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft.",

            "explanation": "The airflow around an aerofoil section sets up a pressure differential between the upper and lower surfaces. The lower surface of a wing is normally at a pressure above atmospheric, whilst the upper surface is at a pressure below atmospheric. Beyond the wing tips the air is nominally at atmospheric pressure. This causes a spanwise flow of air outward away from the fuselage on the lower surface and an inward flow toward the fuselage on the upper surface. At the trailing edge of the wing, where the two flows meet, a twisting motion is imparted to the air and a series of vortices form. These are trailing edge vortices. The effect of these vortices is to create more down wash behind the wing than up wash in front of the wing. This results in the effective air flow (EAF) being inclined to the relative air flow (RAF) by an angle called the induced angle of attack (αi). Because of this local increase in induced angle of attack, the overall lift generated by a wing will be below the value that would be generated if there were no spanwise pressure differential. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. Induced drag increases with decreasing speed (for a constant lift force). This is because, as speed decreases, the downwash caused by the tip vortices becomes more significant, the rearward inclination of the lift is bigger, and therefore induced drag is higher.",

Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag.

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

Flaps increase the camber (and sometimes the area) of the wing, which increases the amount of lift that can be produced by the wing, for the same IAS (indicated airspeed). They also increase the drag of the wing, by more than they increase lift. This means that the aircraft will always fly more efficiently (better L/D ratio) without flaps, hence why they are not used in the cruise, or the climb, when possible. Flaps are primarily used for take-off and landing. For take-off, we can rotate at a lower speed, using less runway, and maintain a lower flying speed on the initial climb out. For landing, we can approach at a slower speed (with a higher approach angle if necessary, due to the extra drag), and therefore land in a shorter distance. For take-off, using flaps is a trade-off between runway length and climb requirements. Flaps are bad for climbing, as they produce more drag, but they will get us off the runway earlier. Therefore, if there is a long runway and high obstacles around, lower (or no) flaps should be used, whereas a short field take-off with few obstacles should use higher flap settings. If there is a short field with obstacles, run the performance calculations carefully for both, and use whichever is better. In terms of this question, the take-off distance will obviously reduce from no flaps (clean) to some flaps, due to the lower distance to rotation, but will begin to increase again towards full flaps, as the aircraft have so much drag that even if it does leave the ground early, it will struggle to climb to the screen height. Many aircraft would not be able to sustain a climb at all with full flaps set, and the final stage of flaps often produces little extra lift than the last stage, but produces lots more drag.",

Interference drag is caused by the mixing of the boundary layers at the junction of adjoining aerofoil surfaces Adding fairings at the junctions, e.g. trailing-edge wing roots and blended winglets, can reduce its effect.",

            "explanation": "Vortex generators, are rows of small, thin aerofoil shaped blades which project vertically (about 2.5 cm) into the airstream. The principle of operation of vortex generators is that they create small vortices that cause the faster moving air above the boundary layer to be deflected from the top of the boundary layer to the slower moving air near the aerofoil surface. This transfers momentum and re-energises the lower layer of the boundary air, delaying the separation point to further aft along the aerofoil surface. Vortex generators are also frequently used on a swept wing to delay tip stall and improve the stall characteristics. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. For aeroplanes travelling at high subsonic or transonic speeds, vortex generators weaken the shockwave and decrease shock drag but have no diminishing effect on wing-tip vortices. Nevertheless, the vortices produced by the vortex generators diminish shock buffet and are beneficial to the aeroplane’s overall performance",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag FORM DRAG Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates. On aircraft, for example, a fairing is often fitted around a fixed undercarriage leg to reduce form drag to an acceptable level.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, can experience up to a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. When an aircraft enters ground effect, the reduced downwash changes the makeup of the total angle of attack (AoA), by reducing the induced AoA (αi), and therefore increasing the effective AoA (αe). This changes the effective angle of lift, reducing induced drag and increasing lift. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, when entering ground effect, effective angle of attack (αe) increases, due to reduced downwash.",

Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Parasite drag drag exists even if lift is not being created, (just from the airframe moving through the air).

Your feedback is highly valued as it helps us ensure that this question aligns closely with the official version. Thank you for your input! Plain flaps (figure 1; description a) simply lowers the trailing edge of the wing, increasing camber. It finds primary application in low-speed aircraft and situations where extremely short takeoff and landing distances are not essential. When slotted flaps (figure 2; description c) are deployed, they create a gap or slot between the flap and the wing. This slot is designed to channel higher-pressure air from the lower surface over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. By doing so, it postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Compared to plain or split flaps, slotted flaps offer a greater increase in CLmax while inducing less drag. Fowler flaps (figure 3; description b) operate by first moving backward and then downward. Initially, they expand the wing area and subsequently enhance its camber. Due to the combined effects of increased area and camber, Fowler flaps provide the most substantial lift augmentation among all flap types. Moreover, they generate minimal drag due to the presence of single or multiple slots and the reduction in thickness-to-chord ratio as the chord length expands. Split flaps (figure 4; description d) are located at the lower surface of the wing's trailing edge, and when lowered, they do not alter the contour of the upper surface. At low angles of attack, they provide a lift increase similar to that of a basic plain flap, but slightly more lift at higher angles. This is because the upper surface's camber remains unchanged, preventing airflow separation. However, the drag is higher than for the plain flap due to the increased depth of the wake.",

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

            "explanation": "Please note that downwash can mean two slightly different things. Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow (primarily due to 3D airflow and wingtip vortices). It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing as part of lift generation. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the same thing, in fact, but there are some differences to how we view them in different contexts as part of the syllabus. The two similar terms do not cause a problem in this question, and the correct answer remains the same. The main wing generates downwash as a by-product of lift generation; the magnitude of downwash is proportional to the lift created. Think of the momentum change in the airflow as being the 'equal and opposite reaction' to the lift force, in order to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion. Therefore, one can say that the greater the downwash, the greater the lift being generated by the aerofoil. If the aerofoil is producing more lift, its angle of attack will be greater, and downwash will be greater, especially towards the wingtip where vortices are stronger. If we observe a lot of downwash, we can conclude that a lot of lift is being generated.",

They do increase drag also. 2 - Kreuger flaps - The underside of the leading edge unfolds, to split the airflow much further down than the usual stagnation point, thereby forcing more air over the upper surface wing, generating higher lift and a faster boundary layer, delaying the stall. There is some drag penalty for using Kreuger flaps. 3 - Slats - The most effective high lift devices; very little increase in drag, but a much delayed stall, so the wing can have a much higher CLMAX. They achieve this by squeezing some high speed air through that slot from beneath to above the wing. The annex here is not perfectly descriptive, but we will assume that the old position is outlined only, and the new position is filled in with colour. This means that item 1 is being extended, whereas items 2 and 3 are being retracted. This means that only item 1 is increasing the CL (and in fact, even extending item 3 (slats) does not actually increase the CL really, it only increases CLMAX by delaying the stall). Note: If you get an annex just like this in the exam, it would be worth commenting or appealing based on the annex, as it is very difficult to work out which whether each is retracting or extending without any indication of what position comes first and what comes last.",

Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, increase CL values for all angles of attack, also increasing drag, with only a small increase in the critical angle of attack (but that varies depending on the specifics of the wing). They are less common to use on large commercial aircraft than the other leading edge devices, but are used on a few different fighter jets, amongst other aircraft types. Slats do not increase CL for normal values of AoA, instead, they just delay the stalling AoA, allowing for a higher CLMAX due to the higher critical AoA.

CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. LEADING EDGE HIGH LIFT DEVICES There are two forms of leading edge high lift device commonly in use: the leading edge flap and the leading edge slot or slat. VARIABLE CAMBER LEADING EDGE FLAP To improve efficiency by giving a better leading edge profile, the camber of a leading edge flap may be increased as it is deployed. Unlike trailing edge flaps, which can be selected to intermediate positions, leading edge flaps are usually either fully extended (deployed) or retracted (stowed). Leading edge flaps increase the critical angle of attack. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flapsalters the pressure distribution around the wing. Trailing edge flaps decrease the critical angle of attack. LIFT TO DRAG RATIO The L/D ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore, the highest value of the L/D ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up.",

To maintain this flow, the fluid must be moved at the same rate, despite the constricted space (throat) in the middle of the tube. Therefore, the velocity of the fluid is increased, as the fluid needs to flow faster in the constricted area.

As we can see, at “4” the diameter has not expanded to its full width, therefore it is faster than at “1”. The speed at “2” is lower than at “3” because the reduction in diameter is not yet complete.

A wing is shaped and tilted so the air moving over it moves faster than the air moving under it. As air speeds up, its pressure goes down. So the faster-moving air above exerts less pressure on the wing than the slower-moving air below.

This scenario is effectively asking what happens if we land with less flaps. Well of course, with less flaps, our stall speed will be higher, as flaps increase the camber (and sometimes area) of the wing, allowing an aircraft to fly slower with the same amount of lift. With a higher stall speed, the approach speed VREF will be higher, the aircraft will touch down with more groundspeed, causing a longer landing distance than if a higher flap setting were to be used. So that is (1) and (3) answered, and we must remember that with a lower flap setting we have less lift available for the same IAS, and lower drag. The component that influences our landing distance is the lift, though, as the lack of lift means we have to fly at a higher speed, and land at a higher speed. The extra drag from more flaps would not really reduce our landing distance, as all the braking action during landing comes from the brakes (and reverse thrust, if available), and the flaps actually reduce the weight of the aircraft on the wheels, so reduce braking ability slightly.",

They have stable stall characteristics and decent efficiency for small GA and trainer aircraft. Elliptical planforms are the most complex, the most expensive to manufacture, but are mathematically designed to produce the least induced drag. This is because their shape changes the lift distribution to make the root produce more of the lift, and this reduces nicely to zero at the wing tip. This means the air which wishes to go round the wingtip is less prone to doing so, and therefore produces smaller, less impactful wingtip vortices. These smaller wingtip vortices mean that elliptical wings produce less induced drag than other wing planforms. This is part of the reason that they were fitted to some older fighter aeroplanes such as the Supermarine Spitfire, an aircraft that was very reliant on its turning ability, and would therefore experience high induced drag during these manoeuvres. Modern jet aircraft do not use these planforms as they are annoying and expensive to manufacture, and don't have as good high-speed characteristics as swept-tapered wings.",

Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. Based on the above, we can say that the answer must be one that includes \"Landing\". Ground effect has greater effect on low wing aircrafts than high wing aircrafts due to being closer to the ground.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that curve 2 is correct.",

Take a look at the Cirrus SR-22 examples in the attached figure. Notice the difference in wingtip vortex size at altitude, vs. near the ground? When your wing is close to the ground, wingtip vortices can't get as big, because as they spin around your wingtip, they impact the ground and dissipate. The result? A reduction in downwash. Less downwash, less induced drag. This means that ground effect reduces the coefficient of induced drag (CDI), which is a component of the total drag coefficient (CD). Summary: Flying low to the ground limits your vortices and the downwash from the wings, which reduces the induced drag coefficient (CDI), and decreases the total drag accordingly. Ground effect is definitely experienced within half a wingspan of the ground. In this question, the wingspan equals 20 m which equals approximately 60 ft (65 ft to be exact). Nonetheless, the lowest height is the one where the ground effect will be stronger, and therefore 30 ft is where CDI is lowest.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

The extension of flaps causes a very large increase in the coefficient of lift, as well as a significant increase in drag. If this happens for just one wing, but not the other, it can lead to very difficult handling characteristics for the pilot to try and control. This is called flap asymmetry. The right wing has its flap down, but the left wing does not. That means the lift from the right wing will be higher than the left wing, so a strong roll to the left will occur. This will be accompanied by a yaw to the right, due to the increased drag on the right wing, but with flap asymmetry, the roll is the dominant effect by far.",

The spacing of the streamlines indicates the change of speed; streamlines close together indicate a high airspeed and those further apart a low airspeed. The ‘equation of continuity’ states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed; air mass flow is constant. From Bernoulli’s theorem it can be deduced that an increase of airspeed around an aerofoil results in a decrease of air pressure and vice versa. THE STAGNATION POINT The stagnation point is that point on an aerofoil at which the approaching airflow becomes stationary. It is located on the leading edge of the aerofoil just below the maximum point of curvature and moves downward and aft along the lower surface of the aerofoil profile as the angle of attack increases. AEROFOIL UPPER-SURFACE AIRFLOW The flow over the top of the section accelerates rapidly around the nose and over the leading portion of the surface - inducing a substantial decrease in static pressure in those areas. The rate of acceleration increases with increase in angle of attack, up to about 16°. The pressure reduces continuously from the stagnation value through the free stream value to a position on the top surface where a peak negative value is reached. From there onwards the flow continuously slows down again and the pressure increases back to the free stream value in the region of the trailing edge.",

Its purpose is to increase the critical angle of attack thus enabling a higher angle of attack to be maintained by the airplane without stalling. It may operate either automatically or manually. When extended, the slat introduces a small gap between itself and the leading edge of the wing causing a Venturi effect through which the airflow accelerates adding to the kinetic energy and re-energizing the boundary layer. This enables the boundary layer to travel further back along the upper surface of the wing against the adverse pressure gradient before separating from that surface.",
