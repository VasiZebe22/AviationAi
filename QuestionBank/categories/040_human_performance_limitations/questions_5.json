The first cockpit tool that tends to suffer from stress is communication. When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. One of the biggest threats in the flight deck is high workload. During high workload periods, such as during takeoff, landing, or in emergency situations, pilots may have limited time and cognitive resources to engage in extensive communication. Therefore, opportunities for communication are often reduced as pilots focus on critical tasks to safely operate the aircraft. Therefore, information overload has the effect of reducing communication, situational awareness and overall mental ability. Note: The need for communication in periods of high workload might increase to ensure safety, and non-verbal communication is reduced even more since the crew is occupied and is not able to use body language during communication with each other.",

There are three stages: Alarm, Resistance, and Exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

Motor programmes enables an individual to perform more than one task at the same time by freeing mental resources – this way, one task can be performed requiring conscious attention, while performing another one at an unconscious level (motor programme). In this case, flying straight and level is a task which only requires a limited amount of our mental resources, because motor programmes have already been developed to handle it and can, therefore, be executed on a subconscious level whilst performing another task which requires conscious attention.",

They are usually right. IMPULSIVITY (“do it quickly”) – If you feel the need to act immediately and do the first thing that comes to mind without considering the best solution to a problem, then you are exhibiting impulsivity. Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible. This feeling can cause you to leave the action to others – for better or worse. Antidote – I am not helpless. I can make a difference.",

It is one of the factors controlling a person's behaviour, through their attitude more than their personality. We will go through each option. \"The amount of motivation depends on internal factors only.\" This is not the case, whilst motivation to do something is affected by internal factors (thoughts, feelings, etc. specific to a person), it is not only controlled by this. Motivation is also controlled by the required action, or perhaps the output. For example, if people know they are going to benefit from performing a task, they will have a stronger motivation to do it. \"Low motivation causes boredom, whereas high motivation always improves reaction times.\" Low motivation can be a cause of boredom, or low mood in general, but high motivation does not necessarily improve reaction times at all, that is more affected by a person's level of arousal. \"Motivation is governed by task factors, and is the same for all persons completing the same task.\" No, as mentioned in the first option, motivation can be influenced by task factors (you are not going to have motivation to spend an hour doing work if you're not getting paid, or some benfit from it), but it is also affected by internal factors specific to the particular person. Not everyone has the same motivation for each task. \"Motivation affects the direction and intensity of a person’s behaviour.\" Yes, this is correct. The motivation a person has is one of the reasons for them to behave in a certain way, and can greatly affect the intensity of that behaviour or action.",

            "explanation": "One of the most important aspects of a safe flight operation is the requirement for crew members to carefully monitor the aircraft's flight path and systems, as well as actively cross-check each other's actions. Humans are not good at monitoring constant situations and, therefore, it is easy to fall behind the aircraft. This is especially true when no deviations are expected to occur, as in the case when monitoring automated systems. This can induce a feeling of automation complacency (too much reliance on the machine) and lead you not to check things as often as you should (hypovigilance). Hypovigilance is a lack of attention to detail, it is akin to a microsleep which can occur at any time during the flight, especially during periods of monotony, reduction of workload, during simple and repetitive tasks, low lighting, high temperature and constant and monotonous noise. During long-haul flights, hypovigilance is often unavoidable. To help prevent hypovigilance during flight, in a multi-crew operation, it is possible for crew-members to take planned naps (controlled rest) - these should be short, approx. 20min. It is also helpful to engage in social conversation and physical activity such as arm and leg stretching may also assist in maintaining wakefulness. During the night, turning up the cockpit lights will also help. However, this deteriorates night vision. It is also useful to keep the mind a little busy rehearsing abnormal/emergency procedures, as this will not only increase your readyness to such events, but will also keep you brain engaged with the aircraft in mind. The SOPs have been written, authorised and amended for such long-haul flights with many physiological factors taken into account, and will make sure that the flight is completed to the correct safety standards, without faults or omissions, so they should always be followed.",

Its purpose is to utilize the knowledge and skills of all the crew members in order to improve situational awareness and encourage collaboration. It ensures the efficient use of all available resources by flight crews, minimizing errors, reducing stress, and boosting overall efficiency. In the given scenario, both pilots focused on re-planning the route instead of sharing the tasks to utilize all available resources leading to a poor CRM.

After methodical training, a rate of 1 to 100 is considered to be realistic and pretty good. A checklist can be used to reduce the effects of human memory and attention limitations by ensuring consistency and completeness. In order for a checklist to provide valuable assistance for crew members, certain design criteria should be observed: 1. The most critical items on the task-checklist should be listed as close as possible to the beginning of the task-checklist, in order to increase the likelihood of completing the item before interruptions may occur. 2. The more items a checklist has, the more likely one of them is forgotten. A long checklist should be subdivided to smaller task-checklists or chunks that can be associated with systems and functions within the cockpit. Division of pages should be obtained with protruding thumb locators. 3. Sequencing of checklist items should follow the “geographical” organization of the items in the cockpit, and be performed in a logical flow (panel scan sequence). We note that this guideline could conflict with Nos. 1 above. In most cases where this occurs, this guideline (No. 3) should take precedence. 4. The most critical items should be emphasized by use of colour, bold, italics or upper case. 5. Checklists should be designed in such a way that their execution will not be tightly coupled with other tasks - to ensure maximum attention is devoted to the checklist execution. 6. Check lists should be unambiguous and easy to read, presented in easily understood language.",

However, Startle and surprise effects, which are known to influence pilot performance in many detrimental ways: from mere distraction to inappropriate actions or hasty decision makin; well-learned procedures and skills can be discarded and substituted by inappropriate reactions, including freezing or over-reacting at the controls => are difficult to be generated in a simulator, where totally unexpected situations are impossible to create. Stress is unlikely to build up in such environment.",

            "explanation": "LONG TERM MEMORY This is where all our basic knowledge (e.g., memories of childhood, training, etc.) is kept – you might liken it to the unconscious, with more capacity and ability to retain information than short term memory – its storage capacity is regarded as unlimited, and possibly consists of several interlaced systems, such as semantic memory, episodic memory, plus procedural memory. Procedural Memory (also known as Motor Programmes): stores information about motor skills e.g. interaction of muscles and balance involved in riding a bicycle. Episodic Memory: stores information about past events which can be affected by suggestion e.g. last year’s holidays (can be unreliable). Amnesia usually affects only episodic memory. Semantic Memory: stores general knowledge e.g. the meaning of words, grammar rules etc. It tends to be accurate and long lasting. Repetition (or rehearsing) is used to get information into it, combined with organising it, placing it into some sort of context or associating it with an emotion. The main limitation of the long-term memory is that information retrieval can be difficult. Therefore, knowledge stored in long-term memory should be pre-activated (with planning and anticipation) so it can be available when required and have the access time reduced. Long-term memory is influenced by experience, repetition, suggestion, desires, and expectations. Note: SHORT TERM MEMORY - Otherwise known as working memory, this is for data that is used and forgotten almost instantly. The capacity of the working memory is limited to 5 plus/minus 2 items (7 plus/minus 2 according to the old syllabus), which can be stored for an average period of 15 to 20 seconds",

When several tasks have to be performed simultaneously, especially when these tasks require a lot of conscious attention, people tend to reduce communication, because communication also uses up mental resources. Communication is the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information by various means, including speech. Officially, around 80% of all communication is achieved by factors other than words, otherwise known as metacommunication, which consists of those tools, other than the words, which complement them in order to communicate. The fact that somebody is not talking does not mean they are not communicating. It is said that 7% of communication is accomplished verbally, 38% by unconscious signals, such as tone of voice, and the remainder 55% by non-verbal means, such as body language. Non-verbal communication can accompany verbal communication, such as a smile during a face-to-face chat. Body language can be very subtle, but powerful – for example, the word “no” with a smile will be interpreted quite differently from one accompanied by a smack in the mouth. Non-verbal communication may also include written information or notes. Unfortunately, the side-by-side seating arrangements in the cockpit tend to lessen the effects of body language, so the choice of words (and their packaging) assumes a greater importance.",

The first cockpit tool that often gets affected by stress is communication. High workload can induce stress and fatigue. When there's a need to perform several tasks at the same time, especially tasks that demand a lot of focused attention, people tend to reduce their communication because it also uses up mental resources. When individuals are presented with too many tasks or information to manage in a short time, they can experience task saturation. This results in cognitive overload, making it difficult to process additional information, including that required for effective communication. In a high workload scenario, individuals may prioritize tasks that directly relate to flying the aircraft and managing immediate challenges. Tasks that are perceived as less critical, such as verbal communication among the crew, might be deprioritized or even neglected. Recognizing this challenge and implementing effective communication strategies are essential for maintaining safe and efficient flight operations. CRM training equips flight crews with strategies to manage workload, prioritize tasks, and maintain effective communication and coordination.",

It is the body’s response to a stressor, which is an internal or external stimulus that is interpreted as a threat to the body’s equilibrium, and prepares it for action. There are three types of stressors: Environmental Stress Factors – These factors are related to the environmental condition. For a flight deck, they might include: Extreme Temperatures. A generally pleasant temperature for individuals wearing regular clothing is approximately 20°C. When it goes beyond 30°C, there's a rise in heart rate, blood pressure, and perspiration. However, below 15°C, people start feeling uncomfortable and may experience reduced sensation and control in their hands, particularly for precise muscle actions. Noise. Intense noise (over roughly 90 dB) disrupts performance, resulting in concentration disruption and deterioration of information retention in working memory. The flight crew errors are increased. Vibration. Vibration can impact the entire body or specific parts. Any vibration induces fatigue and can influence visual and motor performance, resulting in discomfort. The vibration's frequency determines the affected body parts, and its intensity governs symptom severity. Low humidity. A modern aircraft's air conditioning draws external air through the engine's compressor. At typical airline altitudes, temperatures range from -30°C to -55°C with extremely dry air (5% humidity). Humans prefer comfort at 40% to 60% humidity, but lower humidity leads to discomfort due to drying of nose and throat membranes. Internal Physiological Stressors – fatigue, lack of physical fitness, hunger, thirst, dehydration, pain, sleep deprivation. Except for pain, aircrew typically have control over these factors. It's crucial for crews to ensure they begin their duty without these internal physiological stressors. Psychological/emotional stress – inter-personal conflicts, discrimination, fear of failure, death of a relative, divorce, financial problems, job insecurity, etc.",

Stress is a natural human reaction and it is not always negative! A certain moderate amount of stress is beneficial to human performance - it stops you slowing down and keeps you on your toes – this is the sort associated with success. Stress is a very subjective matter – every individual is different and stress reactions as well as their magnitudes differ from person to person. The individual level of stress depends on the individual’s subjective perception of available abilities and comparing them to the situational demands. In humans, the physiological reaction to stress is the non-specific “fight or flight” response. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. During the “fight or flight” response, the sympathetic nervous system is activated and physiological changes can include: Increased breathing, which supplies sufficient oxygen to the muscles; Acceleration of heart rate and dilation of blood vessels in the muscles; Dilation of the pupil; Tunnel vision; Dry mouth, sweating, shaking.",

            "explanation": "EXTERNAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS FACTORS OR ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS FACTORS These factors are related to the environmental condition. For a flight deck, they might include: Extreme Temperatures. A generally pleasant temperature for individuals wearing regular clothing is approximately 20°C. When it goes beyond 30°C, there's a rise in heart rate, blood pressure, and perspiration. However, below 15°C, people start feeling uncomfortable and may experience reduced sensation and control in their hands, particularly for precise muscle actions. Noise. Intense noise (over roughly 90 dB) disrupts performance, resulting in concentration disruption and deterioration of information retention in working memory. The flight crew errors are increased. Vibration. Vibration can impact the entire body or specific parts. Any vibration induces fatigue and can influence visual and motor performance, resulting in discomfort. The vibration's frequency determines the affected body parts, and its intensity governs symptom severity. Low humidity. A modern aircraft's air conditioning draws external air through the engine's compressor. At typical airline altitudes, temperatures range from -30°C to -55°C with extremely dry air (5% humidity). Humans prefer comfort at 40% to 60% humidity, but lower humidity leads to discomfort due to drying of nose and throat membranes. INTERNAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS FACTORS Basic internal physiological stress factors are related to our needs, such as hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep deprivation, pain. Except for pain, aircrew typically have control over these factors. It's crucial for crews to ensure they begin their duty without these internal physiological stressors.",

Strict definition: In everyday language, several words are often used to describe the same or very similar concepts. When a word is adopted by professional language, no ambiguity exists as to what is meant. Simplified grammar: Complex sentences are not used in favour of efficiency. For example, the ATC request “Check speed”, which replaces the sentence “Please, check if you are flying the cleared speed”. This reduces the risk of ambiguities leading to dangerous situation.

ANTI-AUTHORITY (“don’t tell me”) – You display this attitude if you resent having someone tell you what to do, or you regard rules and procedures as unnecessary. Antidote – Follow the rules. They are usually right. IMPULSIVITY (“do it quickly”) – If you feel the need to act immediately and do the first thing that comes to mind without considering the best solution to a problem, then you are exhibiting impulsivity. Antidote – Not so fast. Think first. INVULNERABILITY (“It won’t happen to me”) – You are more likely to take chances and increase risk if you think accidents will not happen to you. Antidote – It could happen to me. MACHO (“I can do it”) – If you have this attitude, you might take risks trying to prove that you are better than anyone else. Women are just as likely to have this characteristic as men. Pilots with a macho attitude are always trying to impress others and prove themselves by taking unnecessary risks. Both men and women are susceptible to a macho attitude, which leads to foolish and often dangerous behaviour. While pilots must have a high level of confidence in their abilities, it’s important to avoid becoming overconfident and adopting a macho attitude. Antidote – Taking chances is foolish. RESIGNATION (“What’s the use?”) – You are experiencing resignation if you feel that no matter what you do, it will have little effect on what happens to you. You may feel that when things go well, it is just good luck and when things go poorly, it is bad luck or someone else is responsible. This feeling can cause you to leave the action to others – for better or worse. Antidote – I am not helpless. I can make a difference.",

By the very nature of the way the cockpit is run, the Captain is normally overloaded in the event of a problem. Laissez-faire Cockpit: A laissez-faire cockpit exists when a passive approach by the captain allows decisions, choices and actions to be made by other crew members, with a major risk of an inversion of authority. Self-centred Cockpit: A self-centred cockpit is one where crew members tend to do their own thing without telling the others what is going on. Synergistic Cockpit: An effective flight deck (synergetic cockpit) exists when decisions are taken by the captain with the help and participation of other crew members. The captain motivates the crew and develops the skills of the crew. Supports team working and clearly communicates intentions and required standards. In this case, when conflicts arise, the leader tries to clarify the causes and reasons of the conflict with all persons involved.

There is potential for danger in this situation due to a mix of status and role. Both pilots have earned the role of \"Captain\" within the company by completing command courses, which allows them to be the Commander on their flights. The role of Commander is decided by the Operator, and there can only be one commander of a flight. As the question dictates that the newly upgraded Captain has been designated as Commander, then this is what shall happen, and the Line Training Captain will sit in the Right Hand Seat, and be the Second in Command. This could lead to an inverse or overly flat cockpit gradient, where the (assumably) more experienced Line Training Captain is in the lower role within the cockpit, so may attempt to take over decision making. Another option is that either pilot may assume the other is doing a particular job, and it will not be done at all.",

A briefing is designed to provide information quickly and effectively. Of standard type/standard sequence of briefing items. Elements always appear in the same sequence, and meet the expectations of the receiver who is used to that sequence making it easy to spot an omission. Understood by all crew members. A simple but well-understood plan of action, supported by all is preferable to a possibly brilliant but misunderstood plan. All in-flight briefings should be conducted by the pilot flying to inform the pilot monitoring of the planned course of action. The optimum time for an in-flight briefing is a period of low workload shortly before the briefed event occurs.",

The aim of this phase is to reduce the level of stress. => Finally, during the exhaustion phase, the body is busy eliminating the products of the previous phases such as stress hormones and the student will most likely feel tired, even exhausted. This is what the student will be experiencing during the debriefing. GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME (GAS) The biological reaction to stress, which the organism is mobilized by is the General Adaptation Syndrome, where adaptation means the tendency of the body to fight to restore homeostasis against forces that upset the body’s natural balance. There are three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Alarm – The alarm reaction stage refers to the initial symptoms the body experiences when under stress. You may be familiar with the “fight-or-flight” response, which is a physiological response to stress. This natural reaction prepares you to either flee or protect yourself in dangerous situations. Stress hormones (adrenalin) will cause a massive release of glucose into the blood, and an acceleration of pulse and blood pressure and an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. However, no specific organ is affected. Resistance – The stress response is channeled into the specific organ system or process most capable of dealing with or suppressing it. During this stage, a different stress hormone cortisol (cortisone) is released which assists the body to quickly convert fats to sugar to prolong the mobilization of energy in the body. If an individual is exposed to stress for too long, his/her energy resources become depleted. Exhaustion – This stage is the result of prolonged or chronic stress. The organs or process dealing with the stressor break down and we return to the generalized format of the alarm phase. This needs time to get rid of the waste products created by the above processes.",

According to J. R. Anderson, the acquisition of such expertise involves three stages, namely: Cognitive, Associative and Autonomous. Cognitive phase – the learner thinks consciously about each individual action. In this phase, movements are slow, inconsistent, and inefficient. The learner might need to recite mentally or aloud the steps which need to be taken. Associative phase – the separate components of the overall action become integrated. Movements become more fluid, reliable, and some parts of the action are controlled automatically. Automatic phase – the total manoeuvre can be executed smoothly without conscious control. At this stage, trying to consciously monitor its execution will slow it down and increase rate of error.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.03.01.03.01: Explain the link between the types of memory (to include sensory, working/short-term and long-term memory). There are three main levels of memory in the multi-store model; the sensory store (very short), the working memory (short-term memory) and the long-term memory. The sensory store (sensory memory) is very interesting, it is almost like your vision has its own \"fade-out\" effect, where you see something and then stop looking at it, but your brain is able to see it for up to a second longer. It works the same with hearing, but actually a bit better still. When you hear something, a sentence perhaps, the brain can effectively play it back for the next few seconds. You may know this from when you have been focussed on a task, but someone speaks to you, and you only begin to focus on their words after they have finished speaking, but somehow, you are able to remember exactly what they have said. This is the sensory store. It is mainly useful for giving our brains enough exposure time to process images and sounds. The visual sensory store lasts less than a second, and the auditory sensory store can last up to 5 seconds. What has happened in this scenario is that the pilot has performed their usual fast instrument scan (not focussed on detail at all), and has seen all the instruments, expecting them to be indicating the same things they usually indicate. The pilot's brain has taken in the sight of the different oil pressure gauge, which is different from normal. The vision of it will stay in the sensory store for 1 second, which is enough time for the brain to note down something different from usual. At this point, no information has been consciously processed yet. The pilot then looks back at the gauge (if they had already looked away), and focuses on its reading, processing the information, and detecting that the oil pressure is abnormal in one engine. That information is now held in the working memory, where it can be committed to the long term memory via repetition and thought. The pilot does not usually process the information from a fast scan like this, for example, they would be unable to tell you the exact oil temperature reading after a normal scan. These fast scans are good at spotting abnormalities, which are then processed as such.",
