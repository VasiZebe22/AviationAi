            "explanation": "VMBE is the maximum brake energy speed. It is the speed which an aircraft can safely stop from, without overloading the brakes with energy. The brakes take the vast majority of an aircraft's kinetic energy in as heat, so will have a limit on the temperature they can withstand, which equates to a maximum energy they can stop, before overheating and causing effects like brake fade, brake fires and tyre blowouts. VMBE obviously varies a lot on weight, and the heavier an aircraft is, the more kinetic energy it has at the same speed, so the lower the VMBE. VMBE also depends on temperature and density altitude, as the hotter and higher the airfield is, the higher the groundspeed for any value of IAS. It is an upper limit of V1, as V1 is the highest speed an aircraft would begin a stop during take-off. If the calculated V1 is higher than the VMBE, then the VMBE should be used as the V1 speed, and this will cause a reduction in the FLLTOM (Field Length Limited Take-Off Mass). If the aircraft were to use a higher V1 than the VMBE speed, braking could be compromised due to overheating, which would cause melting of the fusible plugs in the tyres, brake fires, and brake fade. Therefore, V1 ≤ VMBE (V1 must be less than or equal to VMBE) The annex attached above is the graph and guidance for calculating if the VMBE will be limiting. You do not need to use the graph at all for this question, but it is good to get an association. There is another speed mentioned in the options, the max tyre speed. This is the speed above which the aircraft's tyres are not rated, and may cause a blowout. This should be higher than the expected speed of lift off (VLOF), and whilst there is an option close to that, it uses a \"less than\" sign instead of \"less than or equal to\", and it is not the subject of the question.",

For small angles, sin γ ≈ tan γ = climb gradient. Therefore Climb Gradient = ((Thrust - Drag) ÷ Weight) × 100. It is expressed as a percentage. The rate of climb (ROC) may be calculated by multiplying the climb gradient (as a percentage) with TAS (True Air Speed). Best ROC is obtained when the difference between Power Required and Power Available is at its maximum. Power Available decreases with altitude and so does the achievable ROC. Notice that 3 of the 4 forces of flight are used to make the calculation: Thrust, Drag and Weight. Regarding our question: Rate of Climb (ft/min) = TAS (kts) × Gradient (%). Therefore, Climb gradient = Rate of Climb ÷ TAS => 1 000 ÷ 194 = 5.15%. Remember that climb gradients are always expressed as percentage. Alternative: Climb Gradient = Rate of Climb / TAS x 6 000 / 6 080 Climb Gradient = 1 000 / 194 x 6 000 / 6 080 = 5.087",

This does not save any fuel, due to the increased time to get to more efficient altitudes. There are two ways to do this. Reduced take-off thrust (FLEX), or through a fixed de-rate. The main difference being that a de-rate limits the total engine thrust, but FLEX take-off just limits how much of the engine we use, and we could select TO/GA thrust at any time and use the whole amount of thrust. There are reasons that either, or even both may be used. Derated take-off thrust makes the engine behave like a smaller engine. This means that the aircraft does not have to conform to the same minimum control speeds as if TO/GA thrust was used, allowing for lower VMCG and VMCA. Derated take-offs are also allowed to be used on a wet runway and on a runway contaminated with standing water, slush, snow, or ice. Reduced thrust take-offs do not have that luxury, and are not allowed for use on contaminated runways (although wet runways can be used if the take-off performance is acceptable for the reduced thrust in wet conditions). Therefore, a derated take-off is allowed on either runway, but a reduced take-off would only be allowed on the wet runway.",

            "explanation": "VMCG concerns the calibrated airspeed for minimum control on the ground (i.e. using primary aerodynamic controls only to correct the yawing tendency). We know that flying surfaces are more effective the faster air flows over them so, if the yaw is less pronounced, the required airspeed for counteracting it need not be so high. As elevation and temperature increase (Hot High and Humid) VMCG decreases. In high density/low temp conditions if you fly at your original VMCA you will lose control. To maintain control you have to fly faster. You have a higher minimum control speed. If conditions are hot, high and humid the air is less dense. This reduces thrust and means when you lose the critical engine on takeoff there is less yawing effect from asymmetric thrust than there would be in denser air. The linkage between VMCA, VMCG and VS has to show that in the worst case you can recover safely from an engine failure. Once past V1 you have to keep control while accelerating. By lift-off you have to be able to maintain straight flight. At the same time OEI performance must be enough to meet the required climb gradient, but that is not part of the determination of VMCA, which only asks for a demonstration of straight flight at full power on the live engine(s) If you are flying at or near VMCA it must be with a steady bank angle of about 3-5deg toward the live engine. If you bank toward the dead engine or overbank toward the live at VMCA minimum control speed rises sharply.",

In such cases, it is normal for the operators to use approved procedures to reduce the thrust, so that the aircraft is at or close to its performance limits at the reduced thrust setting. Doing a take-off with less than full thrust does not save fuel. It actually increases the total fuel burn, because of the increased time to height. Nor does it necessarily reduces the aircraft noise. It is quite likely to leave a bigger noise footprint, because the aircraft is lower and closer to any noise monitoring site, than it would be under full thrust.

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. => Based on the above, we can conclude that the Runway Length Limited Take-Off Mass increases (due to the reduced take-off run required with the use of flaps) and the Climb Limited Take Off Mass decreases (due to the degraded climb performance).",

Consequently, the aircraft will accelerate more slowly. With a higher V1, the acceleration to VLOF to be achieved on one engine is smaller than with a lower V1. Therefore, the aircraft will take-off sooner (closer to the line-up position). It will then climb at the same shallow angle as with a lower V1.

This speed range between the Mach numbers for the low-speed stall and high-speed stall is called the buffet margin. The important point to understand is that the margin between the low-speed and high-speed buffets decreases with increasing altitude. It seems that in this question they are asking about the speed and not the margin and the effect of altitude. If we look at the graph, with decreasing altitude the high speed buffet increases and the low speed buffet decreases (increasing the margin).",

A.205 - Take-off LOSS OF RUNWAY LENGTH DUE TO ALIGNMENT (a) The length of the runway that is declared for the calculation of take-off distance available (TODA), accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA) and take-off run available (TORA) does not account for line-up of the aeroplane in the direction of take-off on the runway in use. This alignment distance depends on the aeroplane geometry and access possibility to the runway in use. Accountability is usually required for a 90°-taxiway entry to the runway and 180°-turnaround on the runway. There are two distances to be considered: (1) the minimum distance of the main wheels from the start of the runway for determining TODA and TORA,’L’; and (2) the minimum distance of the most forward wheel(s) from the start of the runway for determining ASDA,’N’. Where the aeroplane manufacturer does not provide the appropriate data, the calculation method given in (b) should be used to determine the alignment distance. The above AMC means that the distance used during lineup with the runway should always be removed from the TORA, TODA and ASDA. This is not the case when the aircraft can lineup on the beginning of the threshold without turning of course, but that is not a very common scenario. In terms of this question, though, any distance used lining up on the runway must be accounted for.",

            "explanation": "The two major variable costs are the cost of fuel and the cost of flight time, excluding fuel. The longer the time airborne, the higher will be the scheduled maintenance, salary and leasing charges. Flying faster will save on flight time costs, but increases the fuel burn and therefore fuel cost. The factor derived from the ratio of these two costs, the aircraft operating cost divided by the fuel cost, is called Cost Index (CI) and is given by the formula: CI = Costs incurred over time / Fuel cost. \"Costs incurred over time\" or \"time related costs\" contain the sum of several components, such as hourly maintenance cost, flight crew and cabin crew cost per flight hour, the cost of ownership or aircraft rental, overtime, passenger dissatisfaction, hubbing or missed connections, etc. The CI is a number from 0 to a maximum which could, depending on type, be 100, 200, 500, 999 or even 9999. An index of 0 represents maximum range and the maximum value, whatever it is, represents minimum time. It is normal for a company route to have an attached CI. Alternatively, the CI can be manually input by the flight crew. Airlines determine this ratio using a somewhat complex formula that is presented as a number on the flight plan which the crew then sets in the FMS to control the speed. The higher the cost index the faster the speed, the greater the fuel burn and obviously the shorter the flight time. At a cost index of 000 the aircraft will be at maximum range speed (VMR). The effect of a higher cost index is to increase the speeds, thus saving flight time, but increasing the fuel consumption. The effect of a lower Cost Index is the opposite, to decrease the speeds, thus saving fuel but increasing flight time. The only speed profile that corresponds to the highest CI is: 350 kt, Mach 0.8, 350 kt, where all speeds are the highest.",

            "explanation": "Optimum Altitude Optimum altitude is defined as the pressure altitude for the best possible fuel efficiency in cruise, at which a given thrust setting results in the corresponding maximum range speed at a given weight and speed. As a result, if flown at a higher or lower pressure altitude than the optimum altitude will decrease the aircraft range. The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases. However, for a number of reasons, ATC will probably not allow a cruise climb. The compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb is a step climb. STEP CLIMB means that the airplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum altitude and levels off. As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a point where it is again 2000 ft above the airplane’s current level. And thereafter the climb process can be repeated. This is the most common way of operating jets in real life. The pilot should always aim to use the step climb technique to remain as close as possible to the optimum altitude. Although a climb above the 1.3 g cruise buffet boundary altitude may be possible, it is prudent to maintain the safety that this limiting altitude gives. At times, a further climb may narrow the gap between high speed buffet and low speed buffet, this should be avoided.",

            "explanation": "Note: We believe that the question is badly worded, and is open to interpretation. From recent feedback we know that this is a real exam question. Additionally, based on the feedback we received about the answer to this question, we assumed that the “proper use of fully manual braking” mentioned in the question means \"MAXIMUM manual braking with antiskid operative\". Please let us know if you see this question in the exam via the comments, or email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Autobrake is a system where the pilots do not press the aircraft brakes at all, the aircraft instead modulates its own brake pressure to maintain a selected rate of deceleration. There are multiple levels of braking available, for progressively shorter runways, requiring a progressively higher rate of deceleration. Anti-skid must be operative for autobrake to work. The autobrake cannot control the aircraft laterally, so it would be really bad if the wheels locked up (on a wet runway without anti-skid), and therefore it cannot be used at all if anti-skid is not available. EASA tend to refer to a \"generic\" autobrake system, and this always resembles the Boeing 737 autobrake system, where the autobrake modes are OFF, 1, 2, 3, MAX and RTO. Technically, the maximum rate of deceleration comes from maximum manual braking, or from autobrakes in the RTO mode, and the RTO mode is better in the event of a rejected take-off as it applies the brakes faster and more efficiently than the pilot could usually apply maximum manual braking. Autobrakes 1, 2 and 3 are simple, they produce set rates of deceleration, as does autobrake MAX. Contrary to its name though, autobrake MAX applies a high level of braking, but not quite the maximum brake pressure like max manual or RTO mode. However, autobrake MAX does apply the brakes quickly and efficiently after main gear touchdown, so provides initially a better deceleration than maximum manual braking, however overall, it would then be better to override with max manual to provide the small amount of extra brake pressure, if minimum stopping distance is what you want. Therefore, any landing autobrake setting (even MAX) gives a longer landing distance than using maximum manual braking. We have checked this using Boeing 737 performance figures and they agree with this statement, so we hope that this is what EASA means in this question.",

This has very low friction, so the tyre will have no traction available to applying braking force, the wheel will \"lock up\" and the tyre will just skid on a \"wedge of water\". Hydroplaning occurs differently whether the tyres are spinning or not, and the speed it occurs at is governed by the following two formulas. Tyres are not spinning when the aircraft touches down, hence the increased risk of hydroplaning during landing, rather than during a rejected take-off, which is the other time it could cause problems. (non-rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 7.7 x √(tyre pressure (psi)) (rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 9 x √(tyre pressure (psi)) Therefore the hydroplaning speed is lower for non-rotating wheels, meaning that they are more sensitive to hydroplaning.

The optimum flight profile for a jet aircraft requires a climb after take-off to the optimum altitude. An aircraft weight greater than scheduled, will increase the thrust required and fuel flow, will decrease the thrust available and finally the 90% thrust at 1.32 VMD will be achieved at a lower optimum altitude. The SFC is: Fuel flow / Thrust. With an increased fuel flow and decreased thrust available, because of the greater weight, the SFC will increase. The specific range is: SR = TAS / Fuel flow, and expresses the air miles travelled for every amount of fuel. Thus, for an increased fuel flow, because of the greater weight and for a lower TAS, due to the decreased optimum altitude, the specific range will decrease.",

Please remember this for the exam, and make sure to read each statement and option carefully, and evaluate the question based on knowledge and not just this answer, which could have been misremembered. A Continuous Descent Final Approach (CDFA) is a method of non-precision approach where the aircraft descends at a constant angle from a platform altitude to 50 ft above the runway threshold, rather than the old style \"dive and drive\" method of descending to a MDA/H and flying level until the runway was sighted or the MAP. It has many benefits, the following extract taken from EASA Air Ops. GM1 CAT. OP. MPA 115(b) (4) The advantages of CDFA are as follows: (i) the technique enhances safe approach operations by the utilisation of standard operating practices; (ii) the technique is similar to that used when flying an ILS approach, including when executing the missed approach and the associated missed approach procedure manoeuvre; (iii) the aeroplane attitude may enable better acquisition of visual cues; (iv) the technique may reduce pilot workload; (v) the approach profile is fuel-efficient; (vi) the approach profile affords reduced noise levels; (vii) the technique affords procedural integration with 3D approach operations; and (viii) when used and the approach is flown in a stabilised manner, CDFA is the safest approach technique for all instrument approach operations using NPA procedures. Statements 2, 4 and 6 are correct due to the reduced engine noise, fuel consumption, and therefore emissions. Statement 1 is odd, the feedback shows it to be \"correct\", but the regulations only allow CDFAs up to a glide path angle of 4.5 degrees, other than for steep approach operations, which is a separate approval. Statement 3 is incorrect, as the airframe noise will be the same whether the aircraft does a CDFA or not, it is really dependent on speed and configuration, and the question does not give enough information to gleam any data about these points. Statement 5 is incorrect, the speeds of approach are not always higher for a CDFA.",

            "explanation": "VMBE is the maximum brake energy speed. It is the speed which an aircraft can safely stop from, without overloading the brakes with energy. The brakes take the vast majority of an aircraft's kinetic energy in as heat, so will have a limit on the temperature they can withstand, which equates to a maximum energy they can stop, before overheating and causing effects like brake fade, brake fires and tyre blowouts. VMBE obviously varies a lot on weight, and the heavier an aircraft is, the more kinetic energy it has at the same speed, so the lower the VMBE. VMBE also depends on temperature and density altitude, as the hotter and higher the airfield is, the higher the groundspeed for any value of IAS. It is an upper limit of V1. If the calculated V1 is higher than the VMBE, then the VMBE should be used as the V1 speed, and this will cause a reduction in the FLLTOM (Field Length Limited Take-Off Mass). If the aircraft were to use a higher V1 than the VMBE speed, braking could be compromised due to overheating, which would cause melting of the fusible plugs in the tyres, brake fires, and brake fade. The annex attached above is the graph and guidance for calculating if the VMBE will be limiting. You do not need to use the graph at all for this question, but it is good to get an association.",

An assumed temperature take-off is where the engine thrust is reduced to match the performance on a higher-temperature day, up to either the maximum thrust reduction allowed or the maximum assumed temperature that meets take-off distance requirements.

At low temperatures and low-pressure altitudes where the air density is high, the value of VMCG is also high. Therefore, we can say that as density increases, VMCG increases. V1 is also affected by density due to the temperature effect on density: as density increases, V1 decreases. V1 cannot be allowed to be less than VMCG because engine failure below VMCG means the airplane is uncontrollable, and the definition of V1 is that the takeoff can be continued following engine failure. Given the above, with low temperatures and, therefore, higher density, VMCG increases and V1 decreases.

If an engine fails in the cruise, then the remaining engine(s) are set to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT), in an attempt to maintain height. At cruise altitudes, the attempt to maintain height usually fails, because of inadequate thrust on the remaining engine(s) and the aircraft will descend down to a height at which it is able to stabilise. This is called \"driftdown\" and it is a \"power on\" descent. The driftdown is flown at the best angle of descent speed, which is VMD. Also, the greatest excess thrust is found at VMD and it minimizes the descent angle. A deceleration to VMD at FL350, will create a nose-up attitude and will delay for some seconds the commencement of the descent, improving that way the obstacle clearance. Thus, the Obstacle clearance speed, where the cruise speed of 250 kt CAS is reduced to the Minimum drag speed VMD before commencing the descent, improves the obstacle clearance. Using the obstacle clearance speed maximizes cruise altitude and minimizes the rate of descent for the best off-engine altitude in the given conditions.",

The effect of flaps on TOD is as follows: Initially, increasing flap setting (from no flaps) reduces the take-off distance as the aircraft can lift-off at a lower speed, reducing the Take-Off Run. At a certain point though, the extra drag of high flap settings becomes a problem, as the aircraft will require more distance to accelerate and much more distance to reach the screen height. This extra distance eventually outweighs the small reduction in lift-off speeds when using high flap settings. This creates the curved pattern The final part of this question is to work out whether TOD increases or decreases if an engine fails. If an engine fails at VEF (the most limiting point of the take-off run), then the aircraft will have to perform the rest of the take-off and climb to screen height with half the thrust, so much less performance. Therefore, the TOD in the OEI case is longer than in the AEO scenario, and therefore the graph moves upwards in the event of an engine failure, so the correct answer is figure 4.",

When determining VMCG, the aircraft must be at: maximum available take-off power or thrust on the engines. the airplane trimmed for take-off. the most unfavourable CG position. maximum sea level take-off weight. Because the aircraft rotates laterally around the CG, the position of the CG directly affects the length of the moment arm of the rudder and, thus, the power of the rudder and fin to maintain directional stability and control. The ‘worst case’ is with the CG at the aft limit, so this is where the CG is when the VMCG is determined. If the requirements can be met in this configuration, the ability to maintain directional control will be enhanced at any other CG location. A more forward CG decreases VMCG.",

Since there is often so much stress put into the fact that autobrakes brake at a constant rate of deceleration, and that is mentioned in a few of the options, we can assume that we are really being asked about that. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation; with inoperative anti-skid, the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent of the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. This standard deceleration rate means that the use of other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying even maximum reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing. As per the correct option, the deceleration rate caused by the brakes just reduces due to the deceleration rate of the reverse thrust, making the total deceleration rate the same as if it were just the autobrakes working alone. Note that the question does gloss over a few complexities, though. The runway being considered \"dry\" is the examiner's way of saying \"we have as much traction as we want\", so we can assume that the aircraft is not going to be \"out-braking\" itself and requiring the use of the antiskid system. This is when the reverse thrust system becomes really useful, when braking is reduced by low traction and the reverse thrust provides the majority of the deceleration force. Answer B is incorrect because reverse thrust is used on almost all landings, dry or wet runways. It is trying to confuse you with the requirements for calculating ASDA to only include reverse thrust when wet.",

            "explanation": "V1 is the take-off decision speed. It is the point on the take-off run where the pilots will go from stopping if there is an emergency to continuing. It is created from the maximum speed at which the aircraft can get to and stop again within the ASDA (Accelerate-Stop Distance Available), and the minimum speed where the aircraft can accelerate the rest of the way to V2 speed and screen height by the end of the TODA (Take-Off Distance Available). Sometimes there is a range of V1 speeds that can be chosen from, if the aircraft is under its FLLTOM (Field Length Limiting Take-Off Mass), but we usually choose the \"balanced V1\", which gives the same ASD as TOD in the event of an engine failure at VEF (just before V1). Choosing a V1 that is much too low, such as in this question, means that the changeover point from STOP to GO (if an event happens) will happen much earlier in the take-off roll, which will cause a greatly reduced ASD (Accelerate-Stop Distance) in the event of a rejected take-off, as the aircraft would spend less runway getting up to speed, then have to stop from a lower speed. The big problem is that, in the event of an engine failure at 124 kt, the aircraft would then have to accelerate all the way from 124 kt to 145 kt and reach the screen height (usually 35 ft) by the end of the TODA, when there is half the thrust of normal operation. As you can see from the calculated figures, the aircrat is only supposed to accelerate from 142 kt to 145 kt on one engine (and climb to 35 ft), so asking it for just over 20 kts single engine acceleration will cause the TOD to increase greatly, with the aircraft rotating very late, making it unlikely to reach the screen height in sufficient distance, also reducing obstacle clearance in the climb out. Note: This question does not make it absolutely clear that we are considering the one engine inoperative scenario for the TOD, but our best feedback has given the correct answer we currently have, so this is the assumption we have had to make. Please send any further feedback to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions so we can verify this, thank you.",

The purpose of this is to reduce noise and save fuel, not time, by keeping the aircraft as high as possible for as long as possible. This implies that you start your descent at the correct point. If you start your descent too early, you have to either apply thrust in the descent to arrive at the bottom of descent at the right place, or level off and then apply thrust. If you start your descent too late, you have to apply the speedbrakes so as to increase the drag and arrive at the bottom of the descent point. Despite the fact that the question does not take into consideration the \"bad\" option of starting the descent too late, which requires speedbrakes, the wrong answers only consider a wasteful early descent.

We are therefore asking for any further feedback you can remember from the exams, even if it is just a small change in wording that you noticed. It is all useful for trying to verify the exact question, options and correct answer, thank you! When an aircraft is required to descend later than planned, it is put into a high energy state, meaning that has either too much speed (kinetic energy) or height (potential energy) to perform a standard descent. Ways to reduce this total energy include reducing thrust and increasing drag. In this question thrust is not mentioned (large jet aircraft usually descend at idle thrust), so we must increase our drag somehow. Ways to increase drag include: Increasing aircraft speed (although this does mean the aircraft will have to be slowed down eventually). Extending speedbrakes (more effective at high airspeeds) Using flaps (only works at slower speeds and gives a much lower maximum airspeed to stay below). Extending landing gear early (usually only recommended near to the approach). To go through the options: \"Increase drag by increasing the airspeed and therefore increasing the descent angle, reducing the energy state of the aeroplane due to extra drag.\" Whilst this could be considered correct, there is a more correct option present which explains this option better, and we are still unsure of the exact wording of this answer (we think we are missing a key part that will make it incorrect). \"Use speed brakes and maintain planned descent speed, however, the aeroplane will have a higher energy state when back on the planned profile.\" Whilst this is an acceptable way to reduce excess energy, the aircraft would not have a higher energy state when it gets back on profile, as it would be at the correct speed, and the correct altitude for that position, so it would have the right energy state. Therefore, this is incorrect. \"Increase the airspeed to regain the vertical profile, however, the aeroplane will have a higher energy state when back on the planned profile.\" Correct. Increasing the speed in the descent allows the aircraft to trade altitude for speed, and will be able to get back on the profile, but now at a higher speed. This is a good method of energy management, as now the aircraft is back on the correct profile and at a higher speed, which will naturally want to reduce due to extra drag (and speedbrakes will be more effective at this higher speed also). \"Slow down and use speed brakes to increase the drag and increase the descent angle since the speed brakes are more effective at lower airspeed.\" Incorrect. Speed brakes are more effective at higher airspeeds.",

Below VMC it will not be possible to maintain control of the aircraft using the primary flying controls alone. For each aircraft, VMC is a single speed defined during certification. It is effectively tested in worse case conditions and therefore you may find, on the day, that the aircraft is easier to control than you expect. This provides a desirable safety margin. The factors which could cause the \"happy\" situation where the actual minimum control speed is lower than the published VMC is temperature, pressure altitude and humidity. With increased temperature, pressure altitude and humidity, the asymetric thrust or power reduces, which will result in a decreased minimum control speed.",

            "explanation": "The Take-off Decision Speed (V1) is the maximum speed at which a rejected take-off can be initiated and a stop within the ASDA can be accomplished with the critical engine inoperative. V1 is also the minimum speed at which a pilot can continue takeoff following an engine failure. Following an engine failure, the overall thrust is decreased and the drag is increased. Consequently, the aircraft will accelerate more slowly. With a higher V1, the acceleration to VLOF to be achieved on one engine is smaller than with a lower V1. Therefore, the aircraft will take-off sooner (closer to the line-up position). It will then climb at the same shallow angle as with a lower V1. Therefore climb perfomance remains unchanged. Regarding obstacle clearance, with a higher V1, the overall climb performance is improved. Furthermore, a higher V1 decreases the take-off distance required because for an engine failure go condition, the aircraft will have to accelerate a lesser margin on single engine between V1 and VR. IMPORTANT NOTE: This question contradicts question (329085) in the sense that climb performance remains unchanged. It seems that question 329085 refers to the climb performance regarding obstacle clearance. We would kindly ask anyone who comes across this question to contact us at their earliest convenience. Furthermore, 329085 refers to the stopping performance rather than the take-off distance required. Please note that choosing a lower V1 will improve the stopping distance alone because it will imply that an engine failure can be accepted at a lower speed, meaning that the aircraft will also initiate its deceleration at a lower speed.",

The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is quite similar to question 322315, which we believe is seen more often, but we are treating this as a slightly different question that some students are reporting from different authorities. Hydroplaning is caused by a thin layer of fluid that separates the tires from the runway. It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor/no braking action and directional controllability. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms a very thin, impenetrable layer of slippery liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement. Particularly important in this question is the mention of the rubber deposits in the touchdown zone and the runway being damp (indicating viscous hydroplaning). As an extra help, the examiner says that the runway is long so heavy braking is not required, and is damp (not wet), which reduces the chance of dynamic hydroplaning, particularly as there is not enough water on a \"damp runway\" for dynamic hydroplaning.",

A wet V1 improves the stopping capabilities (final stop point) back to the dry conditions level but degrades the takeoff chances with a reduced screen height in the event of a take-off being continued.

As a result, if flown at a higher or lower pressure altitude than the optimum altitude will decrease the aircraft range. The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases. However, for a number of reasons, ATC will probably not allow a cruise climb. The compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb is a step climb. STEP CLIMB means that the airplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum altitude and levels off. As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a point where it is again 2000 ft above the airplane’s current level. And thereafter the climb process can be repeated. This is the most common way of operating jets in real life. The pilot should always aim to use the step climb technique to remain as close as possible to the optimum altitude. However, it can be beneficial to fly at an altitude other than the optimum altitude in case of, for example, significant tailwind at a different level - even if it means flying significantly below the Optimum Altitude. Or when experiencing severe turbulence at the Optimum Altitude.",

            "explanation": "There are many limitations for an aircraft on take-off. Not only items such as obstacle clearance or field length limitations, but also more obscure limitations such as VMCG, VMBE and maximum tyre speed limits. You must know the reason behind these limitations. This question is about VMBE and maximum tyre speeds. VMBE is the maximum brake energy speed. It is the speed which an aircraft can safely stop from, without overloading the brakes with energy. The brakes take the vast majority of an aircraft's kinetic energy in as heat, so will have a limit on the temperature they can withstand, which equates to a maximum energy they can stop, before overheating and causing effects like brake fade, brake fires and tyre blowouts. VMBE obviously varies a lot on weight, and the heavier an aircraft is, the more kinetic energy it has at the same speed, so the lower the VMBE. VMAX TYRE is the maximum tyre speed. A tyre is only built to spin so fast. When a tyre spins faster than its rated speed, the intense forces can cause it to break apart, and can cause tyre blowouts. Of course, this would be very bad during take-off or landing, so the aircraft cannot go faster than the tyre limiting speed, VMAX TYRE. For this question, we have to evaluate each option, to see if that scenario would limit the Performance-Limited Take-Off Mass (which is the lowest of the performance limited masses, then compared with the structural MTOM to find the RTOM). There are two styles of options, one which mentions a case where the PLTOM might be max tyre speed limited, and the other type which effectively asks why a case might limit the PLTOM. \"to ensure that V2 is greater than VMBE.\" V2 is the take-off climb safety speed, and will only be reached after rotation and lift-off, so we would not have to stop from that speed, so it is incorrect. \"to ensure that V1 is less than or equal to VMBE.\" V1 is the decision speed, so is the highest speed at which the decision to stop can be taken. We must make sure that this is below the VMBE, or the brakes might not be able to handle a maximum speed rejected take-off. Therefore, this is correct.* \"when VR is less than VMAX TYRE.\" The answers have changed in style here. Yes, we must make sure that the aircraft speed does not exceed VMAX TYRE on the ground, but VR is only the speed we begin rotation at, and the not the maximum speed the tyres will go. Also, if VR is less than VMAX TYRE, there is no problem there, so this would not cause the PLTOM to be limited. \"when VLOF is less than VMAX TYRE.\" VLOF is the expected speed where the aircraft main gear will lift-off from the runway, so is the fastest speed expected that the tyres would have to endure. It is faster than VR. Again, as above, we would not have a problem if the VLOF is less than the VMAX TYRE, as this means the tyres will not reach their maximum speed, and should be safe, so there is no need to reduce the PLTOM for this. * Note that this is not quite exact. The stopping segment of a rejected take-off is assumed to begin when the first action is made to close the thrust levers. Now, this is at any speed between V1 and V1 + 2 seconds, and in those 2 seconds, some acceleration may take place. We still measure V1 against VMBE, so the answer is absolutely correct, but the aircraft might end up stopping from just above that speed in reality.",

During the landing ground roll or during a rejected take-off, all spoiler panels are extended to their maximum angle. Some of these panels may be flight spoilers used for roll and drag in flight, and some may be ground spoilers, which are simply deployed on the ground to increase aircraft braking. The primary purpose of the ground spoilers is to maximise wheel brake efficiency by \"spoiling\" or dumping the lift generated by the wing and thus forcing the full weight of the aircraft onto the landing gear. Therefore, if the ground spoilers are inoperative, the aircraft will accelerate as normal, but will have less effective braking capability, so will have a longer stopping distance.

The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases. However, for a number of reasons, ATC will probably not allow a cruise climb. The compromise between a level cruise and a cruise climb is a step climb. STEP CLIMB means that the airplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum altitude and levels off. As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a point where it is again 2000 ft above the airplane’s current level. And thereafter the climb process can be repeated. This is the most common way of operating jets in real life. The pilot should always aim to use the step climb technique to remain as close as possible to the optimum altitude. Although a climb above the 1.3 g cruise buffet boundary altitude may be possible, it is prudent to maintain the safety that this limiting altitude gives. At times, a further climb may narrow the gap between high speed buffet and low speed buffet, this should be avoided. When performing a step climb, buffet limits should be considered. 1.3g buffet onset may limit step climb.",

            "explanation": "This question is a little sneaky. It wants you to know the difference between anti-skid and autobrake. Anti-skid is the system that stops our wheels \"locking up\" - primarily in wet or slippery runway conditions, as that would only damage our tyres, remove our controllability and provide a reduced braking performance. Instead, we want our tyres to be going just slightly slower than our groundspeed, to provide the greatest braking efficiency, especially in low traction conditions, and this is what anti-skid does. Anti-skid is used all the time (except when inoperative, of course) in commercial aviation, due to its many benefits and very few (if any) issues. It can be used when manual braking and when the aircraft is using autobrake. Autobrake is a more modern system, that takes over the pilot's job of pressing the brake pedals. It is set by a dial or series of buttons in the cockpit and attempts to provide a constant, pre-selected rate of deceleration throughout braking. There are multiple levels of braking available, for progressively shorter runways, requiring a progressively higher rate of deceleration. Anti-skid must be operative for autobrake to work. The autobrake cannot control the aircraft laterally, so it would be really bad if the wheels locked up (on a wet runway without anti-skid), and therefore it cannot be used at all if anti-skid is not available. This question is asking about anti-skid (even though it is phrased as if it was about autobrake - sneaky EASA), and therefore, the answer is that anti-skid reduces the landing distance due to the availability to apply maximum deceleration, as opposed to the pilots stamping on the brakes (without anti-skid protection) as hard as possible, which could cause the wheels to lock. You could argue that the pilot may be able to brake just as well as the anti-skid system can, but this is not a racing car, and we are mostly not racing drivers, so the vast majority of the time, this is certainly not the case.",

As the airplane descends into the lower atmosphere where density is greater, the remaining engine can develop more thrust which will equal the drag force, this is the GROSS level-off altitude, but would give no performance margin. So the DRIFT DOWN PROCEDURE is continued to a lower altitude, the NET level-off altitude. The main purpose of the drift down procedure is to bring the aircraft to an altitude where the aircraft can generate enough trust with the remaining to balance the drag. The level-off altitude is determined by the actual air density. However, the conditions in which the aircraft is currently in must be evaluated. Situations such as terrain condition, air traffic situation and ATC coordination are effective in determining the nature of this descent. Depending on the obstacle conditions, the descend process may be delayed or gradually planned. Or, if there is no constraint, optimum descent can be made smoothly.",

This has performance implications for both the rejected take-off and landing. Reduced thrust take-offs or operations from contaminated runways are not permitted when antiskid is inoperative. However, an aeroplane’s Minimum Equipment List (MEL) allows an aeroplane to be dispatched with antiskid inoperative in normal situations, but it is restricted to a much lighter take-off and landing mass for a given distance available. If the stopping ability of the aeroplane if reduced, the fastest speed from which it can stop, VSTOP, is slower. However, to be able to continue the take-off with the critical engine failing at this slower speed results in the necessity to reduce the take-off mass. As the stopping ability of aeroplane reduces, it needs to increase for the accelerated stop distance available. For using the whole runway lenght properly V1 decreases for safety reason.",

Aircraft certified under CS-25 (and some aircraft under CS-23) are given maximum flight speeds as a VMO and MMO (maximum operating airspeed/Mach No.). Depending on the altitude and air temperature, one of these will correspond to a lower airspeed than the other. That one will be the most limiting. The MMO is most limiting at high altitudes, which is when it is most useful for us to refer to our speed in Mach No., whereas at lower altitudes, the VMO is most limiting, and we should use IAS/CAS instead. The point where this crossover happens is called the crossover altitude. A common altitude for this is around 28000 ft, but it depends on the aircraft and conditions. If descending at a constant mach number, the Mach number will not exceed the MMO (as it is constant), but using the ECTM graph above, we can see that the IAS will be increasing, and therefore the IAS may well reach and exceed VMO if the crossover is delayed to a lower altitude. The other two options \"shock stall speed\" and \"never exceed speed\" can be discounted here, as aircraft with VMO/MMO do not have a VNE and the shock stall speed occurs based on the Mach No. and MMO, both of which we know remain constant (and it is not a limiting speed as such).",

            "explanation": "This question is asking us to know the relationship between weight limitation and take-off/climb limitations. Of course, weight reduces our take-off performance in every way. Not only does it increase our required take-off distance, but it also reduces our climb gradient. We often want to take-off with as much weight as possible, as this either means adding more passengers or cargo, or adding more fuel, both of which are good. Our Maximum Allowed Take-Off Mass (MATOM) is the most limiting of our climb limited take-off mass (CLTOM), obstacle limited take-off mass (OLTOM), field length limiting take-off mass (FLLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). Depending on the airport, conditions, and surrounding obstacles, these are all calculated by the performance software. Higher weight means lower performance, meaning that, in this question, the lower MATOM is on runway 21R, meaning that something about that departure is more restrictive, hence we cannot take-off with as much weight as we could on runway 21L. Now this could be the runway length, but the chart shows the runways having equal lengths, and the question specifies that we should assume they have the same slope. Of the explanations, there is only one which satisfies that category of 21R being more restrictive. We can quickly go through each explanation: \"The runways are field-length-limited as each runway will have its own individual Field-Length-Limiting Take-Off Mass.\" The question says that the slope can be assumed to be the same, and we can see from the chart that the runways are practically the same length (only 1 metre different), so these runways would have the same FLLTOM, meaning this cannot be correct. \"Runway 21L has more limiting close-in obstacles than runway 21R and requires a greater climb gradient in the second segment.\" Runway 21L has a less limiting departure, as the MATOM is higher, and also, we have no idea about exactly where any limiting obstacles exist, second segment, fourth segment, etc., we do not have that information. \"More limiting obstacles are within the obstacle domain for runway 21R compared to runway 21L, requiring a greater climb gradient.\" Yes, this would explain the weights. Runway 21R could have more restrictive obstacles, requiring higher climb performance, therefore a lower maximum weight. \"The runways are climb-limited with the obstacle domains being the same since the runways are close together with parallel thresholds.\" If the obstacle domains were the same, then the climb-limited take-off masses would be the same for both runways. Obviously this is not the case, as the maximum allowed take-off masses are different. For instance, they may have different departure routes or offset thresholds from each other.",

As a result, if flown at a higher or lower pressure altitude than the optimum altitude will decrease the aircraft range. The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. Which means that the best range speed (1.32 VMD) decreases (along with the total drag) and, as a consequences, the aircraft needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. The Mach number will decrease and the aircraft will be able to climb a little since it is not limited by the high Mach number and high drag. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases.",

            "explanation": "BALANCED FIELD LENGTH When the Accelerate-stop Distance Available (ASDA) is equal to the Take-off Distance Available (TODA), this is known as a Balanced Field Length. Likewise, when the ASDA and TODA are different lengths, this is known as an Unbalanced Field Length. BALANCED FIELD TAKE-OFF A balanced field take-off is performance based and is a condition where the Accelerate-stop Distance Required (ASDR) is equal to the Take-off Distance Required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field take-off can be performed. A Balanced field length is used to simplify the field-length take-off mass. When applying this concept, TOD = ASD and V1 = V1 Balanced. And this means that we are using the minimum requirements in case of engine failure, thus increasing safety margins. When using stopway or clearway, extra distance will be available and V1 will vary. BALANCED V1 The first graph on the attached figure, helps understanding the impact of increasing or decreasing V1. Analyzing it, we can conclude the following: A Balanced V1 is a V1 speed which results in TODR equal to ASDR. Often called the “Ideal V1” as it gives the minimum field length required for a given weight and optimum performance. Any lower V1 (V1 < V1B) would increase TODR, as it would take longer for the aircraft to accelerate to V2 with OEI. As a result, the total field required increases. Any higher V1 (V1 > V1B) would increase ASDR due to a higher energy absorption by the brakes. As a result, the total field required would also increase. => In essence, Balanced V1 improves field length limited take-off performance. => Unbalanced V1 allows for higher take-off weights by taking advantage of any runway and clearway or stopway available in excess of balanced field length. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

To convert the gross gradients into their equivalent net gradients a reduction or decrement has to be applied: 0.8% for 2-engined aeroplanes 0.9% for 3-engined aeroplanes 1% for 4-engined aeroplanes",

The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. STEP CLIMB means that the airplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum altitude and levels off. As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a point where it is again 2000 ft above the airplane’s current level. And thereafter the climb process can be repeated. This is the most common way of operating jets in real life. The step climb process can be repeated throughout the cruise and it helps to explain why the cruise altitudes at the end of the flight are higher than at the start. Remaining within 2000 ft of the optimum altitude ensures the range is 99% of the maximum specific range.",

It is the altitude where a specified IAS and Mach number represent the same TAS. Below the Crossover Altitude, the climb/descent is performed maintaining a constant IAS. Whereas above the Crossover Altitude, the climb/descent is performed maintaining a constant Mach number. At the Crossover Altitude, there is one value of TAS which corresponds to the given Mach number and the given IAS at the same time. In this case, the crossover altitude of this aircraft has been incorrectly raised higher up. This is because the altitude where 250KIAS = M0.78 is higher than the altitude where 250 KIAS = 0.75. (Draw an ECTM graph or use the finger trick to prove this to yourself if necessary.) As this is a tricky question requiring a lot of thought, let us go through both the climb scenario and the descent scenario. In the climb scenario, before/below the CA (crossover altitude), we are flying at a constant IAS, with our Mach No. increasing as we climb. As the CA is now higher than it should be, it means we spend more time increasing our Mach No., and that means it may go over our MMO. We cannot breach our VMO here as we are flying at a constant IAS before the CA, and then a reducing IAS after the CA. In the descent scenario, we are initially descending with constant Mach No., but increasing IAS. As the CA is higher up than usual, we reach it earlier, and our IAS is not able to increase up to its usual value, so our descent below the CA may be at a lower speed, however, there is no chance of overspeed in the descent scenario, either by breaching the VMO or the MMO. We start with a constant Mach No., decreasing after the CA, and our IAS initially increases, but to a lower value than usual, then remains constant. So to conclude, the only opportunity for any type of overspeed here is by breaching MMO, and that would be possible when in the climb.",

Above the tropopause in the lower stratosphere, the temperature remains constant. Having chosen a climbing speed, the pilot will maintain a constant IAS through the lower levels. But during the climb, both TAS and Mach No will be increasing. On most airliners, at around 27000 ft the Mach number will reach a point where, any further increase will start causing the problems associated with the high speed flight. At this point and thereafter, the pilot will switch to climbing at a constant Mach number, instead of IAS. If the constant IAS is maintained beyond this point, there is a risk of exceeding the aircraft's maximum Mach number, Mmo. From the Mach number formula: Mach No = TAS / LSS = TAS / 38.94√(temp in K), we get that the Local Speed of Sound decreases as the temperature decreases. But since above the tropopause the temperature remains constant, the TAS stops decreasing and remains constant too. But the continuous reduction of the air density means that, IAS continues to decrease, provided that a constant Mach number is maintained.",

            "explanation": "Note: We believe that the question and available options are badly worded, and are open to interpretation. From recent feedback we think that this is the most representative of the real exam question, but we can only verify that with further feedback. We have assumed that the question means \"MAXIMUM manual braking\", but we can't be 100% sure that it say exactly that in the real exam. Please let us know if you see this question in the exam via the comments, or email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Autobrake is a system where the pilots do not press the aircraft brakes at all, the aircraft instead modulates its own brake pressure to maintain a selected rate of deceleration. There are multiple levels of braking available, for progressively shorter runways, requiring a progressively higher rate of deceleration. Anti-skid must be operative for autobrake to work. The autobrake cannot control the aircraft laterally, so it would be really bad if the wheels locked up (on a wet runway without anti-skid), and therefore it cannot be used at all if anti-skid is not available. EASA tend to refer to a \"generic\" autobrake system, and this always resembles the Boeing 737 autobrake system, where the autobrake modes are OFF, 1, 2, 3, MAX and RTO. Technically, the maximum rate of deceleration comes from maximum manual braking, or from autobrakes in the RTO mode, and the RTO mode is better in the event of a rejected take-off as it applies the brakes faster and more efficiently than the pilot could usually apply maximum manual braking. Autobrakes 1, 2 and 3 are simple, they produce set rates of deceleration, as does autobrake MAX. Contrary to its name though, autobrake MAX applies a high level of braking, but not quite the maximum brake pressure like max manual or RTO mode. However, autobrake MAX does apply the brakes quickly and efficiently after main gear touchdown, so provides initially a better deceleration than maximum manual braking, however overall, it would then be better to override with max manual to provide the small amount of extra brake pressure, if minimum stopping distance is what you want. Therefore, any landing autobrake setting (even MAX) gives a longer landing distance than using maximum manual braking. We have checked this using Boeing 737 performance figures and they agree with this statement, so we hope that this is what EASA means in this question.",

In this case, the calculated V1 is 150 kt, but the crew are using an incorrectly selected V1 of 140 kt.

Temperature An increase in temperature reduces engine thrust. An increase in temperature also means that IAS for a required V1 will be achieved at a higher TAS and therefore at a higher groundspeed. As temperature increases, ASDR increases. Engine Bleed Air Any bleed air reduces the engine thrust available. With bleeds on, ASDR increases. Runway slope If the runway slopes downhill the aircraft will be easier to accelerate, assisted by the component of the aircraft weight acting downhill, reducing the accelerating distance to V1. Even though the aircraft will be also easier to stop, the acceleration phase have the greatest effect on the ASDR. The opposite applies for an upslope runway and ASDR increases. Runway surface If the runway is contaminated by snow, slush or standing water, there will be additional drag due to fluid resistance. If the take-off is rejected and braking is required, the coefficient of braking friction is severely reduced on a runway which is wet, icy or contaminated by snow or slush. Any contamination will increase ASDR. Pressure altitude A higher-pressure altitude reduces engine thrust. A higher pressure altitude also means that IAS for a required V1 will be achieved at a higher TAS and therefore at a higher groundspeed. A higher-pressure altitude increases, ASDR increases. Wind Headwinds will reduce the ground speed at the required take-off airspeed. A tailwind does the opposite to a headwind. Tailwinds will increase the ground speed and therefore increases the ASDR. Because temperature and pressure vary with time and position, both horizontally and vertically, it is necessary, in aviation, to have a standard set of conditions to give a common datum. This standard temperature is just a reference, but the aircraft performance will depend on the actual temperature and pressure conditions as well the aircraft pressure instruments reading. A higher airfield elevation means that the aircraft will be affected by a higher pressure altitude.",

The purpose of the improved climb procedure is to achieve an increased V2 in order to be closer to VX, this will in turn improve climb performance. Consequently, the climb limit mass can increase, increasing the performance limited take-off mass. The aircraft is held on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed. However, this is only possible when there is an excess of available field length due to the increased take-off distance required and the take-off mass is not Maximum tyre Speed limited.",

            "explanation": "BALANCED FIELD LENGTH When the Accelerate-stop Distance Available (ASDA) is equal to the Take-off Distance Available (TODA), this is known as a Balanced Field Length. Likewise, when the ASDA and TODA are different lengths, this is known as an Unbalanced Field Length. BALANCED FIELD TAKE-OFF A balanced field take-off is performance based and is a condition where the Accelerate-stop Distance Required (ASDR) is equal to the Take-off Distance Required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field take-off can be performed. A Balanced field length is used to simplify the field-length take-off mass. When applying this concept, TOD = ASD and V1 = V1 Balanced. And this means that we are using the minimum requirements in case of engine failure, thus increasing safety margins. When using stopway or clearway, extra distance will be available and V1 will vary. BALANCED V1 The first graph on the attached figure, helps understanding the impact of increasing or decreasing V1. Analyzing it, we can conclude the following: A Balanced V1 is a V1 speed which results in TODR equal to ASDR. Often called the “Ideal V1” as it gives the minimum field length required for a given weight and optimum performance. Any lower V1 (V1 < V1B) would increase TODR, as it would take longer for the aircraft to accelerate to V2 with OEI. As a result, the total field required increases. Any higher V1 (V1 > V1B) would increase ASDR due to a higher energy absorption by the brakes. As a result, the total field required would also increase. => In essence, Balanced V1 improves field length limited take-off performance. => Unbalanced V1 allows for higher take-off weights by taking advantage of any runway and clearway or stopway available in excess of balanced field length. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

Of course, they are then going to depart with an actual OAT of 20ºC. The question then asks whether the actual takeoff distance will be shorter/longer/the same as the 45ºC performance calculation. Once the question has been understood, it is a lot more simple. Even with the assumed (FLEX) temperature set to 45ºC, the engines will produce very slightly more thrust when operating in a low temperature due to the colder, denser air. This is not usually mentioned, as it is only a small increase, but it will cause a small reduction in the actual takeoff distance, in comparison with the 45ºC performance calculation. The lower air temperature will also contribute to a lower density altitude, meaning that the takeoff speeds (which are fixed IAS values) will have lower true airspeed (TAS) values, so the aircraft does not actually have to accelerate as much to obtain the same takeoff speeds in the actual OAT. This causes a further reduction in the actual takeoff distance, in comparison with the 45ºC performance calculation.

In order to maintain a constant IAS => TAS must increase. Lift = CL 1/2ρ Vsquared S Drag = CD 1/2ρ Vsquared S => Both CD and CL are determined by angle of attack. If we assume that the weight of our aircraft remains constant, then as we climb at constant IAS (which also means constant dynamic pressure) we must keep the angle of attack constant to maintain constant lift to match the constant weight. This in turn means that the CD will remain constant. So as we climb we have a situation in which CD and 1/2ρ Vsquared are both constant, so (unless our surface area (S) changes), we must have constant drag. So climbing at constant IAS produces constant drag.",

SHORT EXPLANATION Because the runway length decreases for all scenarios, rejected take off, engine failure on V1, normal take-off, the weight may need to reduce due to lineup loss, but the V1 will remain the same (always for a balanced runway, and only very slight changes possible with an unbalanced runway, increase vs decreases depends on the type of unbalance), but the \"V1 is unchanged\" answer is by far the most correct answer with these options. FULL EXPLANATION V1 is the take-off decision speed, the speed at which pilots have to either decide to stop, or take a potential problem into the air. If the words V1 are said in the cockpit and no action has yet been made to slow the aircraft, the aircraft must take-off. It splits two different worst case scenarios, which are engine failures just before V1 and just after V1 (actually VEF is the real name for the assumed engine failure speed, but we do not need to go into that in this question). The \"STOP\" scenario is where a failure occurs just before V1, is recognised in time, and the aircraft begins stopping just after V1. This would produce the maximum possible accelerate-stop distance. The \"GO\" scenario is where an engine failure happens at V1 and the aircraft now has to accelerate the rest of the way until V2 and screen height with only 1 engine, so an early engine failure like this is the worst-case scenario, where the aircraft will have the worst possible performance. Increased weight is bad for all scenarios, it is bad for acceleration and climb out performance and for accelerate-stop performance, requiring an increased distance for both. For a balanced field (TODA = ASDA), there is a graph where the STOP and GO scenarios are compared to find the maximum weight at which there is 1 speed where the two change over, from \"cannot go\" to \"cannot stop\", and we call that the balanced V1. Even when we are lighter than this maximum weight (the FLLTOM), we usually use the balanced V1 anyway, to give best safety margins on either scenario. V1 can sometimes be increased or decreased by the addition of clearways or stopways, and it increases the maximum weight for the take-off too, by offsetting the V1 to favour either the \"STOP\" or the \"GO\" scenario, as the other scenario might require lower performance due to the extra distance available. For instance, with an extra length of stopway, we can accelerate for longer before needing to begin stopping, so our V1 can increase, and therefore our \"GO\" scenario becomes easier to do (higher speed engine failure), so we add extra weight to fill in the excess performance. Lineup loss is the loss of runway length remaining due to our aircraft using some of it to get onto and align with the runway centreline before take-off. It reduces all runway lengths, TORA, TODA and ASDA, as we are just starting slightly further down the runway. It therefore might reduce our take-off weight slightly, due to reduced performance, but our V1 will most likely stay the same. A balanced V1 would always stay the same after lineup loss, and unbalanced V1s could increase or decrease very slightly (by much less than 1 knot - so we do not really care in practice), depending on the type of unbalance, but on the whole, V1 will be unchanged.",

Improper use of the flight director. ROTATION AT IMPROPER SPEED This situation can result in a tail strike and is usually caused by one of two reasons: rotation is begun early because of some unusual situation, or the airplane is rotated at a VR that has been computed incorrectly and is too low for the weight and flap setting. => In this case, if a lower than actual take-off mass is considered, the take-off speeds will be too low for the heavier aircraft. The computed VR is lower than the required VR, leading to an early rotation. The aircraft's speed is too slow which results in a nose-up attitude without the aircraft lifting off from the runway.",

The power-to-weight ratio can be calculated by dividing the engine power by the mass. The single-engine airplane (1) has a piston engine with 160 horsepower (hp) and a mass of 1 300 kg. The power-to-weight ratio is approximately 0.123 hp/kg. The multi-engine aircraft (2) with one engine running is effectively operating as a single-engine aircraft. In this case, we should only consider the power of the remaining engine, which is 160 hp, and the mass of 1,990 kg. As a result, the power-to-weight ratio is roughly 0.080 hp/kg. In this case, we can observe that the multi-engine aircraft (2) with one engine running has a lower power-to-weight ratio than the single-engine aircraft (1). Therefore, the single-engine aircraft has more power per unit of weight. Generally speaking, an aircraft will perform better if its power-to-weight ratio is higher. Increased acceleration, climb rate, maneuverability, and overall performance characteristics can be attained by having an aircraft with a higher power-to-weight ratio. In this scenario, other performance considerations can be made, for example, regarding the failed engine on the multi-engine aircraft. With an engine failure, not only will the power-to-weight ratio be reduced, but the increased drag will also affect the aircraft's performance. So even if both aircraft are operated at the same weight, the extra drag from the failed engine will cause a decrease in performance.",

However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed. V2 is considerably slower than the best angle of climb speed, which is VX. Climbing with a speed closer to the best angle of climb greatly enhance the climb performance. If runway available it would be possible to stay on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed, this will ensure that at the screen height, a faster V2 will be reached, closer to VX.

            ],
            "explanation": "This can be thought of quite intuitively. For this question we consider the two most limiting events that can happen during the take-off. Engine failure just before V1 (STOP scenario) and engine failure at V1 (GO scenario). The all-engines take-off is almost never limiting. The stop scenario sets the length of the ASDR (Accelerate-Stop Distance Required). The higher the V1 or the higher the weight, the greater the ASDR. The GO scenario sets the length of the TODR (Take-off Distance Required - distance to get to screen height - engine fails at V1). The lower the V1 or the higher the weight, the greater the TODR. The V1 being lower means that the aircraft has to perform more of its total acceleration with an engine failed, which uses more time and runway distance. We often want to maximise the amount of weight that we can take-off with. This means setting the best possible V1 that allows our ASDR and TODR to fit exactly within the runway we have got, no unused runway. Realistically we want to calculate it so our ASDR equals the ASDA (available) and our TODR equals the TODA. On a balanced field, the ASDA (available) and TODA are the same, so you end up getting a “balanced V1”, which is a great starting point, and allows for easy calculations. This will correspond to a certain FLLTOM (field length limiting take-off mass) which uses up the whole runway in both cases. This is also the most effective use of space, but it is not always possible to build runways like this. If you were to add some available stopway, then with the previous balanced V1, you wouldn't use any of the stopway in the STOP scenario, however, we could decide to use it to squeeze in some extra weight by increasing the V1 (to use up all the stopway in the STOP scenario), and this means that the aircraft is closer to the required climb speed in the GO scenario as well, which means that it helps both scenarios, even without increasing the TODA. This means we can add weight as we have extra margin in both cases by using a lower V1. In the other direction, we could add a clearway to the original runway to make it “unbalanced” in the other way. In this case, we could use the extra clearway to reduce the V1, as the aircraft has some extra space to get to the screen height now, so we can afford to lose the engine earlier in the take-off roll and still GO. This lower V1 means that we won't use up all the runway in the STOP case though, so we can increase the weight until both required distances match the available distances. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

            "explanation": "If the runway is sloping, a component of the weight will act along the longitudinal axis of the airplane. This will either augment thrust, or augment drag which will increase or decrease the accelerating force. A downhill slope will increase the accelerating force, and reduce the take-off distance, whereas an uphill slope will reduce the accelerating force and increase the take-off distance. V1 can be increased and consequently the TOM for the same TODA. Even though it is an uphill slope and the aircraft will come to stop within a shorter distance, the aircraft will need a longer distance to accelerate to V1. The acceleration needed to achieve V1 has a major impact in the ASDR calculation. In case of a downhill slope the ASDR decreases.",

Examples would be landing at a high altitude or near sea level under conditions of exceptionally high air pressure. Pressure altitude is primarily used in aircraft-performance calculations and in high-altitude flight The higher an aerodrome’s pressure altitude (high-altitude), the longer the TODR. This is because the air is less dense, which affects both the engine thrust and actual speed at rotation. The reduction in air density reduces the engine mass flow and, therefore, thrust (increases the take off roll), which results in slower acceleration. Second, the reduced air density results in a faster TAS for the same calibrated airspeed VR.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is a Principles of Flight (081) question which has been reported to come up in Performance exams. All aircraft have limitations to their speed and the loads that they can sustain at those speeds. In particular, we have to know about the load/speed diagram for CS-25 (large) aeroplanes. There is a diagram for the maximum load factors (positive and negative) that an aircraft can sustain, whether that limit was to do with a stall limit, or a structural load factor limit. There is also a limiting gust envelope diagram for the maximum gusts an aircraft must be able to handle at various speeds, see annex above. This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. To keep the aircraft within safe operation, the VMO (maximum operating speed) must be kept below VC. This is still very fast, and should not be exceeded in normal operations.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is very similar to Q329997, with slightly different answers. Both have been reported in exams. Increased V2 Procedure This procedure is used to increase the aircraft's climbing capability after take-off (to increase the climb limited mass or obstacle limited mass). At the minimum V2 the climbing performance is poor and may limit the maximum take-off mass. It is important to understand that in the event of engine failure, the initial climb out speed is V2. However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed. V2 is considerably slower than the best angle of climb speed, which is VX. Climbing with a speed closer to the best angle of climb will greatly enhance the climb performance. If extra runway length is available it is sometimes possible to stay on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed to a higher V1, this will ensure that at the screen height, a faster V2 will be reached, closer to VX. As a result of the improved climb performance, the climb/obstacle limited masses can be increased. \"The climb gradient is reduced, and obstacle clearance could be reduced to below the required minimum.\" No, in fact the climb gradient is increased, and nothing will drop below the required minimum, otherwise the procedure would not be allowed. \"The stopping margins for a rejected take-off are reduced.\" Correct. The faster V1 increases the ASDR (Accelerate-Stop Distance Required), and whilst this will not go out of the legal limits (as the procedure would then not be allowed), the extra safety margin will be reduced. \"The safety margins for a rejected take-off could be reduced to below the required minima.\" No, as mentioned just above, the safety margins must always remain at or above the required minima, otherwise the procedure is not allowed. \"The braking capability during a rejected take-off is reduced.\" This requires a little more thought, but is incorrect. The braking capability of the aircraft should not be affected, the brakes should work perfectly well from this higher V1 if a stop is required, and whilst braking will take longer, that is expected from a higher speed. The only things that could really affect the braking capability are brake fade due to overheating and the subsequent melting of fusible plugs, but the aircraft's maximum brake energy will be checked from the higher V1 and should not be high enough to cause either of these to occur outside of normal limits.",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce (degraded climb performance). Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. INCREASED V2 TAKE-OFF In case of engine failure, the initial climb out speed is V2. However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed and is significantly slower than Vx. The purpose of the improved climb procedure is to achieve an increased V2 in order to be closer to Vx, this will in turn improve climb performance. Consequently, the climb limit mass can increase, increasing the performance limited take-off mass. The aircraft is held on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed. However, this is only possible when there is an excess of available field length due to the increased take-off distance required. => Based on the above, we can conclude that the Climb Limited Take Off Mass will increase when using a lower flap setting (improved climb performance) and selecting a higher V2 speed.",

            "explanation": "RTOM (Regulated Take-off Mass) is the final figure used for dictating the maximum allowable mass for a particular take-off. It is the lowest of the Performance Limited Take-Off Mass (PLTOM) and the Maximum Structural Take-Off Mass (MSTOM). As the MSTOM is constant for an aircraft, an aircraft with two different RTOMs for different direction runways must be performance limited in some way. The PLTOM is the lowest of the Climb Limited Take-Off Mass (CLTOM), Obstacle Limited Take-Off Mass (OLTOM) and the Field-Length Limited Take-Off Mass (FLLTOM). The lowest mass of those is the most limiting factor. So in this question, the take-off from RWY 03 must be more limited in some way, to warrant a lower RTOM, which must come from a lower PLTOM. Lets consider each possible limitation. FLLTOM - RWY 03 is the same length as RWY 21 with no slope to account for, but there is a 10 kt headwind to RWY 03, and a 10 kt tailwind to RWY 21, which would cause the FLLTOM to be significantly higher for RWY 03, as that is where there is better take-off performance. As this is not reflected in the RTOM difference, the take-off is not field-length limited. CLTOM - The climb limit is based solely on whether the aircraft can maintain the legal climb gradients. In particular, the second take-off segment with one engine inoperative requires a 2.4% still air climb gradient for a 2-engined aeroplane. It is a still air gradient, so wind is not to be accounted for. This will mean that there are no differences relevant to CLTOM between the two runways, so the CLTOMs would be the same. Therefore, this is not what has caused the difference in RTOM. OLTOM - The only one remaining. The aircraft is taking off towards the mountains on RWY 03, as opposed to the ocean, and a specific obstacle has been identified which will require a particular angle of climb to clear, so this checks out with the RTOM being lower. After considering all possibilities, it must be that the aircraft is obstacle limited on RWY 03.",

High lift devices, such as flaps, change the wing area and shape to potentially increase lift, but they also increase the parasite drag. But before that, the airspeed must be decreased to below the maximum speed at which the landing gear can be operated, VLO, which is always lower than the maximum safe speed to fly with landing gear extended, VLE, and will assist to reduce the already increased aircraft's airspeed, since it is \"too fast\".",

Starts when the flaps are retracted, the final segment speed is achieved, and the thrust is set to maximum continuous thrust. From this point the airplane is climbed to above 1500 ft where the take-off flight path ends.

This could cause the answer to be different, but the question should be different enough that this is clear to you. EFFECT OF FLAPS ON TAKE-OFF RUN AND CLIMB GRADIENT For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes this gap and the climb angle/climb gradient will reduce (degraded climb performance). In this case, due to the high temperature, the minimum climb gradients may not be achieved.",

The only common parameter to enable comparison is that of temperature. Thus the maximum permissible temperature must be calculated for the actual take-off mass from each of the following: • field limit graph • climb limit graph • tyre-speed limit graph • obstacle limit graph From these temperatures, select the lowest and ensure that it does not exceed the environmental limit.

This has very low friction, so the tyre will have no traction available to applying braking force, the wheel will \"lock up\" and the tyre will just skid on a \"wedge of water\". This is why it is important to land firmly and apply as much braking as possible immediately, including reverse thrust and speedbrakes. Speedbrakes are particularly useful as they will remove lots of the aircraft's lift and force it into the ground quite hard, to allow better braking. Hydroplaning occurs differently whether the tyres are spinning or not, and the speed it occurs at is governed by the following two formulas. Tyres are not spinning when the aircraft touches down, hence the increased risk of hydroplaning. (non-rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 7.7 x √(tyre pressure (psi)) (rotating wheel) Hydroplaning speed = 9 x √(tyre pressure (psi))",

            "explanation": "When aircraft are being certified, the manufacturer must test the aircraft in many different ways to define certain levels of performance for many phases of flight, such as take-off distance, maximum rate of climb, landing distance and many more. There are different types of performance categorisation. Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1. The amount of engines directly affects the likelihood of an engine failure occurring during take-off or climb out, so the net take-off flight paths have different safety margins, depending on the amount of engines. For take-off, CS-25 specifies a reduction from the actual take-off flight path gradient of: 0.8% for two-engined aeroplanes; 0.9% for three-engined aeroplanes; and 1.0% for four-engined aeroplanes.",

This is why flexible thrust is not permitted when anything causes a reduction in aircraft performance (e.g. contamination) or an increase on take-off run required (e.g. increased V2).",

It is flown at V2 with take-off thrust setting and flaps-slats extended. The second segment lasts from gear retracted to the gross level-off height. It is also flown at V2 with take-off thrust set and flaps-slats extended. The third segment is a level flap retraction segment ending once the aircraft is clean and has accelerated to the final segment climb speed. At the end of the third segment, the thrust is reduced on the remaining engine(s) to the Max Continuous Thrust (MCT).

            "explanation": "The Flat Rating Concept The rating of a jet engine is the thrust performance that is guaranteed by the manufacturer for a new engine under specific operating conditions such as, take off, maximum continuous, climb, cruise. Some non Prat and Whitney (P&W) engines are rated to a constant compressor speed (RPM). P&W rates there engines to a constant exhaust gas temperature (EGT). This is referred to as the flat rating concept. To get your head around this concept you must understand the following principle. The temperature and density of the ambient air vary inversely. Lower temperature = > Higher Density Higher Temperature = >Lower Density The amount of airflow (lbs/sec) through the engine is a function of compressor speed and air density. It is greater when the compressor speed and density are high. The compressor speed is a function of the energy available to the compressors turbine. That energy comes from the combustion or air and fuel, so the turbine turns faster when the fuel flow rate is greater. The compressor speed is also a function of the airflow through the compressor. Higher rates of air flow reduce the speed of the compressor. The compressors rotational speed and the amount of airflow through the compressor are independent, they affect each other though. The turbine inlet temperature is proportional to the energy available to turn the turbine. The exhaust temperature is proportional to the turbine inlet temperature. So a higher EGT corresponds to a larger amount of energy to the turbine so it can turn the compressor faster. When EGT is held constant, or lowered the result is a prolonged hot section life and at the same time provides the thrust to meet the certification requirements.",

            "explanation": "Sometimes it is operationally useful to reduce an aircraft's thrust for take-off, in order to run the engines less hard; reducing maintenance costs, increasing engine life, etc. This is possible when the aircraft is neither field-length nor climb or obstacle limited, and there is effectively performance to spare. This does not save any fuel, due to the increased time to get to more efficient altitudes. There are two ways to do this. Reduced take-off thrust (FLEX) or through a fixed de-rate. The main difference being that a de-rate limits the total engine thrust, but FLEX take-off just limits how much of the engine we use, and we could select TO/GA thrust at any time and use the whole amount of thrust. There are reasons that either, or even both may be used. The question is talking about a reduced thrust (FLEX) take-off, where we tell the engine to perform as it would in a higher temperature condition. That leads the engine to believe that it is operating in a temperature limited (TGT limited) scenario, so it only produces a lower thrust. The temperature that we want it to mimic is called the assumed or FLEX temperature. Therefore, the performance we can expect with an assumed temperature of 45ºC is the same as we would receive if the OAT was 45ºC. The take-off run would be slightly better than if the OAT was 45ºC, though, as the lift under the wings is still that of 20ºC. This does not change the final answer, though, it is still most correct.",

V1 cannot be allowed to be less than VMCG because engine failure below VMCG means the airplane is uncontrollable and the definition of V1 is that the take-off can be continued following engine failure.

Jet aircraft have much better fuel efficiency at high altitudes, and pilots endeavour to spend the vast majority of their time at high cruising altitudes to take advantage of that efficiency. During flight, as an aircraft burns fuel, it becomes lighter, and therefore is able to fly at a higher altitude, which in turn provides even greater efficiency. This means that the optimum altitude gradually increases over the course of a flight. To follow this optimum altitude, pilots can request step climbs or a cruise climb. Step climbs are where the pilots start at or above their optimum altitude, then the optimum altitude goes above them, and after a certain amount, they request another climb to the next suitable flight level, and the process begins again. For some aircraft on routes with little traffic, they can be cleared to make a cruise climb which allows the aircraft to follow its optimum altitude exactly, climbing continuously. As per the learning objective above, sometimes it is inefficient to make the last step climb of a journey, if there is only going to be a short time spent at the new altitude, as the extra fuel burnt climbing to that altitude will negate the extra efficiency.",

However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed. V2 is considerably slower than the best angle of climb speed, which is VX. Climbing with a speed closer to the best angle of climb greatly enhance the climb performance. If runway available is long enough, it would be possible to stay on the runway for longer during the take-off to build up more speed to a higher V1, this will ensure that at the screen height, a faster V2 will be reached, closer to VX.

MMO is the maximum operating Mach Number. It is usually the limiting factor when flying above the crossover/change-over altitude, where the aircraft goes from flying using IAS to flying using Mach Numbers. Standard crossover altitudes are around 28 000 ft, and are dependent on the climb speed schedule. The question gives two separate climb speed schedule, 250kt/0.74 and 250kt/0.78. This means that the old model of aircraft changed over to Mach Numbers in the climb at the altitude where 250 KIAS equals M0.74, and this has changed to where 250 KIAS equals M0.78 (which will be a higher altitude). If this has changed due to an \"operational limit\", as it is worded in the question, then that must be one of the speed limits mentioned above. As it is the Mach Number component that has increased, then it must mean that the MMO has increased, and the climb speed schedule has changed to allow higher Mach Numbers because of this. Certainly, from the available options, this is the only possible correct one.",

If an aircraft has higher performance, it can do the same procedure or manoeuvre at a higher maximum weight (and remain within safe limits). The flap settings that an aircraft use make a big difference to its take-off and landing. For landing, a higher flap setting decreases the landing distance (due to slower approach speed), but decreases climb gradient, due to higher drag. This means that the field length landing performance is excellent with higher flap settings (therefore higher maximum weight), but the climb performance is worse (therefore lower maximum weights). All we have to do in these questions is look at which flap setting satisfies our requirements for all possibilities (landing climb, approach climb, and field length). This just means we are looking for a column where all the maximum masses are not less than the actual landing mass. The only column where the masses remain above our actual landing mass is the middle one, for flaps 15. That is therefore the only one that fulfils our requirement.",

Effect on Mach Number of Climbing at a Constant IAS: - Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound will decrease as altitude is increased. - If altitude is increased at a constant IAS, the TAS increases. - Therefore, the Mach number will increase if altitude is increased at a constant IAS. This is because TAS gets bigger and LSS gets smaller. As the climb continues, an altitude will be reached at which the flight crew must stop flying at a constant IAS and fly at a constant Mach number, to avoid accidentally exceeding MMO. Effect on TAS of descending at a constant Mach Number: - Temperature increases with decreasing altitude, so the speed of sound will increase as altitude is decreased. - If altitude is decreased at a constant Mach Number, the TAS increases. This is because LSS gets bigger. As the descent continues, an altitude will be reached at which the flight crew must stop flying at a constant Mach Number and fly at a constant IAS, to avoid accidentally exceeding VMO.",

Learning Objective 032.02.03.01.05: Describe the effects of brake release before take-off power is set on the TOD and ASD. This question is quite ambiguous and does not describe the situation very well at all. We are going to have to assume that they are talking about a rolling take-off in comparison with a static take-off, as per the learning objective above. Even with these assumptions though, there are still many variables to be considered here. Without any further information, we can simply say that rolling take-offs increase TOD and ASD in comparison with static take-offs, as static take-offs allow the engines to spool up before releasing the brakes, thereby giving the aircraft more thrust at all points during the takeoff roll, whereas the rolling takeoff uses up runway whilst waiting for the engines to reach take-off thrust. You could certainly argue that setting take-off thrust before being fully lined up would give lower TOD and ASD in comparison to a \"standard\" rolling takeoff, but it is also not advisable, as setting such high thrust in the turn could lead to very bad directional control issues. Also, we do not think this is the correct way to interpret this question.",

            "explanation": "BALANCED FIELD LENGTH When the Accelerate-stop Distance Available (ASDA) is equal to the Take-off Distance Available (TODA), this is known as a Balanced Field Length. Likewise, when the ASDA and TODA are different lengths, this is known as an Unbalanced Field Length. BALANCED FIELD TAKE-OFF A balanced field take-off is performance based and is a condition where the Accelerate-stop Distance Required (ASDR) is equal to the Take-off Distance Required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field take-off can be performed. A Balanced field length is used to simplify the field-length take-off mass. When applying this concept, TOD = ASD and V1 = V1 Balanced. And this means that we are using the minimum requirements in case of engine failure, thus increasing safety margins. When using stopway or clearway, extra distance will be available and V1 will vary. BALANCED V1 The first graph on the attached figure, helps understanding the impact of increasing or decreasing V1. Analyzing it, we can conclude the following: A Balanced V1 is a V1 speed which results in TODR equal to ASDR. Often called the “Ideal V1” as it gives the minimum field length required for a given weight and optimum performance. Any lower V1 (V1 < V1B) would increase TODR, as it would take longer for the aircraft to accelerate to V2 with OEI. As a result, the total field required increases. Any higher V1 (V1 > V1B) would increase ASDR due to a higher energy absorption by the brakes. As a result, the total field required would also increase. => In essence, Balanced V1 improves field length limited take-off performance. => Unbalanced V1 allows for higher take-off weights by taking advantage of any runway and clearway or stopway available in excess of balanced field length. Summary and extra info: If TOD = ASD, V1 = BALANCED, Balanced condition. If TOD > ASD, V1 < V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Clearway, no stopway = higher mass and lower V1 speed If TOD < ASD, V1 > V1 BALANCED, Unbalanced condition. Stopway, no clearway = higher mass and higher V1 speed. TORA (Take-Off Run Distance Available) => RUNWAY only (no STOPWAY or CLEARWAY) TODA (Take-Off Distance Available) => TORA + CLEARWAY ASDA (Accelarate-Stop Distance Available) => TORA + STOPWAY",

DUTCH ROLL. This is an oscillation involving roll, yaw and sideslip. Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability. With a dominant lateral stability this will, when a yaw is introduced, roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into the wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. The CG position has little influence on the lateral stability, but an aft CG will reduce the directional stability because the Moment Arm of the stabilizing moment from the fin will decrease and thus increasing the likelihood of a Dutch roll. To reduce the aircraft tendency to Dutch roll, either the lateral stability should be decreased or the directional stability increased => anhedral would decrease the lateral stability. Aircraft with a tendency to Dutch roll are also fitted with yaw damper. This automatically displaces the rudder proportional to the rate of yaw to damp out the oscillation.",

In the determination of VMCG, assuming that the path of the aeroplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the centreline of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centreline is completed, may not deviate more than 9.1 m (30 ft) laterally from the centreline at any point.",

Cost index is a value used by many aircraft manufacturers to provide the operator a way to fly most efficiently, based on their individual fuel costs and other operating costs (crew, aircraft leasing, maintenance, etc.). A high cost index is used to make an aircraft fly faster, but burning more fuel, when fuel is less costly and/or the other operating costs are high. A low cost index makes the aircraft fly slower, burning less fuel, when fuel is more expensive and/or the other operating costs are lower. Therefore, an aircraft's speed schedule is proportional to the cost index selected, high cost index, high speed, and vice-versa. The speed below FL100 in many airspace types is maximum 250 kt, so if the optimum speed profile in the climb or descent is higher than this, then it is a limitation, hence why it is written in the speed profile for this question. Also to note is that the aircraft flies a fixed IAS below the crossover altitude, and a fixed Mach number above the crossover altitude. Using a lower cost index will reduce the speeds in the profile (but not the 250kt below FL100, that remains the same), so the only correct option is 250 kt (below FL100) / 280 kt / M.78",

The take-off flight path starts once the take-off is complete, at 35 ft with the airplane at V2 with one engine inoperative. On a wet runway, the screen height is reduced to 15'. Operating engines are at takeoff thrust, the flaps/slats are in takeoff configuration and landing gear retraction is initiated once safely airborne with positive climb. The first segment ends when the landing gear is fully retracted. 2. Begins when the landing gear is fully retracted. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the flaps/slats are in the takeoff configuration. This segment ends at the higher of 400'. 3. Begins at 400' or higher specified acceleration altitude. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the aircraft is accelerated in level flight. Slats/flaps are retracted on speed. The segment ends when aircraft is in clean configuration and the final take-off speed has been achieved. Once this has happened, thrust can be reduced from maximum take-off thrust, TOGA, to maximum continuous thrust, MCT. 4. Starts when the flaps are retracted, the final segment speed is achieved, and the thrust is set to maximum continuous thrust. From this point the airplane is climbed to above 1500 ft where the take-off flight path ends.

The optimum altitude is not constant and changes over the period of a long flight as atmospheric conditions and the weight of the aircraft change. Optimum altitude increases with reducing aircraft weight: the drag curve will move down and to the left as the weight decreases through fuel burn. Which means that the best range speed (1.32 VMD) decreases (along with the total drag) and, as a consequences, the aircraft needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. The Mach number will decrease and the aircraft will be able to climb a little since it is not limited by the high Mach number and high drag. The aeroplane maximizes its specific range by remaining at the optimum altitude as it slowly increases (it must climb along the green line shown in the attached figure). As the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases.",

This is called as \"Continuous Descent Approach (CDA)\". The key to obtaining a CDA is to start the descent at the correct place. The Rate of Descent is given by the formulae: ROD = (Power required - Power available) / Weight or (D - T) x TAS / Weight. A stronger headwind would mean that, the groundspeed is lower than expected. A decrease in groundspeed will mean that, it takes longer to travel the horizontal ground distance from Top of Descent to the bottom of the descent. If your rate of descent remains unchanged, the aircraft will arrive at the required level before the bottom of the descent position and, therefore, the rate of descent should be reduced by increasing the thrust. The deployment of the speedbrakes would increase the rate of descent by increasing the drag and may be used for emergency descents (e.g. decompression), where the aircraft must lose altitude as quickly as possible.",

For take-off and landing, higher density altitude causes low air density, which decreases performance. For landing, this comes as a longer landing distance, and a lower gradient of climb after a balked landing (which is a criteria that must be considered as part of the legal performance calculation). A higher density altitude therefore means having a lower maximum landing mass (MLM). Compared to an airfield at sea level, a high field elevation, low pressure system and high temperature decreases the air density. As approaches are made with reference to a constant IAS/CAS, this reduced air density would cause a higher TAS on approach, and means that an aircraft will cross the threshold at a higher groundspeed on landing, and will therefore take a longer distance to decelerate from that higher speed. To combat this, the maximum landing mass is reduced, allowing for a lower approach speed and less energy to slow down during landing. A higher QNH would lead to higher air pressure at the airfield, giving higher air density (lower density altitude) which would lead to a lower groundspeed.",

Operating engines are at takeoff thrust, the flaps/slats are in takeoff configuration and landing gear retraction is initiated once safely airborne with positive climb. The first segment ends when the landing gear is fully retracted. Begins when the landing gear is fully retracted. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the flaps/slats are in the takeoff configuration. This segment ends at the higher of 400'. Begins at 400' or higher specified acceleration altitude. Engines are at takeoff thrust and the aircraft is accelerated in level flight. Slats/flaps are retracted on speed. The segment ends when aircraft is in clean configuration and the final take-off speed has been achieved. Once this has happened, thrust can be reduced from maximum take-off thrust, TOGA, to maximum continuous thrust, MCT. Starts when the flaps are retracted, the final segment speed is achieved, and the thrust is set to maximum continuous thrust. From this point the airplane is climbed to above 1500 ft where the take-off flight path ends. The climb gradient for this last stage must not be less than 1.2%. 1º Segment 2º Segment 3º Segment 4º Segment Starts 35 ft Gear Up > 400 ‑ AGL Flaps Up VFTO MCT Action Select Gear Up Climb to > 400 ‑ AGL Retract Flaps Accelerate to VFTO Set MCT Climb to 1500 ‑ AGL Gradient for 2 Engines > 0% > 2.4% > 1.2% > 1.2% Gradient for 3 Engines > 0.3% > 2.7% > 1.5% > 1.5% Gradient for 4 Engines > 0.5% > 3.0% > 1.7% > 1.7% Note: While third segment is usually flown in level flight, the available gradient must be at least equal to that required in final segment (1.2%).

Segment 2 The second segment starts at the end of the first segment (i.e., when the gear is up). The objective is to retract the flaps. However, flap retraction is not permitted below 400 ft, therefore the action by the pilot is to climb, at no less than V2, until 400 ft is reached. Once 400 ft is reached and flap retraction can commence, segment 2 ends. Since the aeroplane has had the main source of drag removed, the minimum gradient requirement is more severe at no less than 2.4%.",

Source: ICAO Annex 15, Appendix 2 ICAO Annex 15 - Appendix 2 - SNOWTAM format Snow (on the ground). a) Dry snow. Snow which can be blown if loose or, if compacted by hand, will fall apart again upon release; specific gravity: up to but not including 0.35. b) Wet snow. Snow which, if compacted by hand, will stick together and tend to or form a snowball; specific gravity: 0.35 up to but not including 0.5. c) Compacted snow. Snow which has been compressed into a solid mass that resists further compression and will hold together or break up into lumps if picked up; specific gravity: 0.5 and over. Annoyingly, the question does not have the same definition for dry snow as the annex its learning objective refers to. Nonetheless, the definition talks about the snow \"falling off\" the shoe, which seems pretty close to \"will fall apart again on release\". Wet snow does also fit the description rather well though, as the snow sticks to the shoe somewhat under compression.

            "explanation": "The advantage of flying at the maximum range speed is simply that the airplane will use the least amount of fuel and therefore have the least fuel cost for a given distance. Operationally a faster “long range cruise” is often used. This speed is used because getting to destination more quickly, more revenue earning flights can be carried out for a given period. For a given time period, 4% more flights can be carried out with only a per-mile fuel consumption increase of 1%. LRC is NOT more efficient than max range, it is 1% less fuel efficient, mile per mile, so if time were not a factor, maximum range would be best, but as airlines pay a lot of other costs (crew, aircraft usage, maintenance, etc.) per minute of flight time, the extra 4% of speed is quite useful to reduce their other operating costs. These days the speed calculation is mostly a function of the Cost Index, which is a calculation of other operating costs (crew, aircraft lease, maintenance, etc.) divided by the fuel cost. Inputting a high cost index into the aircraft FMC gives a high speed (fuel cheap, other costs expensive, let's get there fast), and a low cost index gives a slow speed (fuel is the most expensive cost, save as much as possible). Without calculating for wind (headwind and tailwind change the aircraft speed schedule for each CI, but are not accounted for in the LRC calculation, which only accounts for weight), a cost index of 0 should be maximum range speed, for highest fuel efficiency. A somewhat higher cost index would give the same speed as LRC, which is faster than max range speed.",

Crosswinds can be very difficult to land in, and may go outside the limits of what the aircraft can do. This is especially important with contaminated runways, where the aircraft tyres may not be able to gain as much traction with the runway, and this could cause the nose wheel steering to be ineffective in counteracting tendencies such as weathercocking of the tail, for example.

As altitudes increases during climb, thrust available decreases, thus excess thrust decreases. As a result from the above formula, the Climb angle decreases, too. Also, during climb, to maintain the IAS constant with the maximum climb thrust power setting, while the available thrust decreases progressively, the nose attitude must be lowered. i.e. the pitch angle must be decreased, in order to reduce the angle of attack and drag.",

Operation on the pavement is permissible if the ACN is less than or equal to the pavement classification number (PCN) of an aerodrome. Because the PCN includes a safety factor, a 10% increase of ACN over PCN is generally acceptable for pavements that are in good condition and occasional use by aircraft with ACNs up to 50% greater than the PCN may be permitted. In such circumstances the movement of the aircraft must be very closely monitored for damage to the aircraft and pavement. The first part is the PCN numerical value, indicating the load-carrying capacity of the pavement. This is always reported as a whole number, rounded from the determined capacity. The only letter that you need to interpret is the first letter of the second part: The second part is a letter: either an R or an F, depending on whether the pavement itself is of a rigid (most typically concrete) or a flexible (most typically asphalt) design. Solution: The exercise is asking the minimum usable PCN, considering an allowable 10% increase; 47 x 1.1 = 51.7 > ACN 50 Annex 14 — Aerodromes (ATT A-28) 19. The aircraft classification number-pavement classification number (ACN-PCN) method of reporting pavement strength 19.1 Overload operations 19.1.1 Overloading of pavements can result either from loads too large, or from a substantially increased application rate, or both. Loads larger than the defined (design or evaluation) load shorten the design life, whilst smaller loads extend it. With the exception of massive overloading, pavements in their structural behaviour are not subject to a particular limiting load above which they suddenly or catastrophically fail. Behaviour is such that a pavement can sustain a definable load for an expected number of repetitions during its design life. As a result, occasional minor overloading is acceptable, when expedient, with only limited loss in pavement life expectancy and relatively small acceleration of pavement deterioration. For those operations in which magnitude of overload and/or the frequency of use do not justify a detailed analysis, the following criteria are suggested: a) for flexible pavements, occasional movements by aircraft with ACN not exceeding 10 per cent above the reported PCN should not adversely affect the pavement; b) for rigid or composite pavements, in which a rigid pavement layer provides a primary element of the structure, occasional movements by aircraft with ACN not exceeding 5 per cent above the reported PCN should not adversely affect the pavement; c) if the pavement structure is unknown, the 5 per cent limitation should apply; and d) the annual number of overload movements should not exceed approximately 5 per cent of the total annual aircraft movements. 19.1.2 Such overload movements should not normally be permitted on pavements exhibiting signs of distress or failure. Furthermore, overloading should be avoided during any periods of thaw following frost penetration, or when the strength of the pavement or its subgrade could be weakened by water. Where overload operations are conducted, the appropriate authority should review the relevant pavement condition regularly, and should also review the criteria for overload operations periodically since excessive repetition of overloads can cause severe shortening of pavement life or require major rehabilitation of pavement.",

Regulations require an aircraft to be operated with a minimum buffet margin of 0.3g. This is called \"coffin corner\", and the way to escape it is just to descend. As the aircraft descends, the stalling IAS decreases (that is a compressibility effect of high TAS at high altitude only). The high speed buffet is based on Mach No., and therefore descending at a constant Mach No. would keep you at the high speed buffet boundary, however descending at a constant IAS/CAS would mean the aircraft's Mach No. decreases (see ECTM graph above), increasing the margin from high speed buffet. Therefore, reducing thrust and descending at a constant IAS will increase the margin from both the low speed buffet and the high speed buffet simultaneously. Looking a bit closer, descending at a constant TAS would also increase both low and (sometimes) high speed buffet margins (dependent on the atmospheric conditions - i.e. not an inversion or isothermal layer), but we never fly to a constant TAS, and it would not be recommended to do so in this case either. Therefore, constant TAS is not correct (also it doesn't work above the tropopause where this is most likely to happen, anyway).",

As the aircraft climbs higher, the low speed buffet boundary increases, as the IAS for a given Mach number decreases, and the IAS stall speed increases due to compressibility effects at high true air speeds. The high speed buffet boundary (shock stall) either stays the same (in terms of Mach Number) or decreases slightly. This means that, with increasing altitude, the two get closer together, and form what is called Coffin Corner up at high altitudes, where only a small speed range is safe to fly within. This means that an increase in altitude leads to a decrease in both low and high speed buffet margins, as the buffet speeds get closer to the aircraft's cruising speed.

The increased V2 procedure exists because V2, the take-off safety speed, is actually very slow, and an aircraft can get much better climb performance by climbing at a higher speed, closer to VMD. Therefore, if the conditions exist where the aircraft can safely use a faster V2, then the climb performance can be drastically improved in the event of an engine failure, and the obstacle/climb limited take-off masses can be increased. This would only be used when a runway is longer than required. A very long runway would allow lots of safety margin in terms of field length, which we can use up, to give us higher climb out speed and climb performance after take-off. This is particularly useful if obstacle clearance after departure is an issue at an airport. So in summary, this is a technique most often used on long runways with high terrain nearby. The increased V2 procedure will increase V1 and VR also, and the aircraft will remain on the ground, accelerating for a longer time. The increased speeds might mean that either V1 or VR could reach their upper limits, which are hazards that must be considered and checked to remain within limits. An upper limit of V1 is the VMBE speed, the speed for maximum brake energy. Above VMBE, it is not assured that the aircraft brakes will be able to absorb all the aircraft's kinetic energy in the event of a rejected take-off, so V1 can never be over VMBE, as the highest speed a stop could commence. An upper limit of VR is the maximum tyre speed (VMAX TYRE). VR is the speed when rotation begins, and must be made so that VLOF (lift-off speed) never exceeds the VMAX TYRE, as the tyres may overspeed otherwise, and cause issues such as blowouts. VR is not directly limited by VMAX TYRE, but VR dictates VLOF which is directly limited by the maximum tyre speed.",

We then have to take any extra factors into account; in this case, we apply a correction of -80 kg per 10 hPa below 1013, and as 985 hPa is 28 hPa lower, then we apply that correction 3 whole times (most restrictive). We will also have to account for the fact that our air conditioning packs are on, which is an MTOM reduction of 850 kg. We must also account for the fact that engine anti-ice is ON, which is an MTOM reduction of 380 kg. 78 700kg - 3(80) - 850kg - 380 = 77 230 kg All other factors are specified in the graph, so do not need extra corrections.",

For this question, the Hydroplaning speed is: Vp = 7.7 x √200 = 109 kt. Thus, the flap settings that can be selected and allow a VREF less than 109 kt to avoid hydroplaning on landing are: Flaps 40 and 30. And the lowest possible one is Flaps 30.",

We use this graph to calculate the brake energy, and required cooling. Entering the graph near the top on the left with 50 000 kg landing weight (in the \"Landing Mass\" section, not RTO mass), go across until the point referencing the relevant brakes on speed. Now in this question we only know the VREF, which is the speed over the threshold, and we add 150% of the 4 kt tailwind, so 6 kt, to this speed. This means we can assume our brakes on speed is 128 + 6 = 134 kt. Of course there will be some deceleration in the flare, but the question will specify an amount to reduce the VREF by if they want you to do so, so we can leave it in this question. Going across to the interpolated position of 134 kt, then directly down to the pressure altitude section. As the QNH is exactly standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), no pressure correction is required, and we can use 1 000 ft pressure altitude, moving the line slightly to the right. Going down to the OAT section, account for the temperature being 25ºC, the line goes to the right again. Then head down to the reference line for the autobrake/reversers section. The level of reverse thrust is shown on the right hand side (either \"no reverse\" or \"normal reverse #2 detent\" can be used). For each of these options, there is a line each the autobrake selection, going downwards; Autobrake Max, #3, #1 and #2. Using the line from above, evaluate each option to find which scenario matches to the correct cooling time.

First, the joint correction for 15º flap and 210 mph tyres which is a decrease of 1 500 kg. Then a correction for 12 kts of headwind (Runway 06 - wind of 060/12 kt). The correction is +400 kg per kt, so an increase of 400 x 12 = 4 800 kg No mass decrement required for PMC, as the PMC is ON.

From this intersection, drop vertically to the first reference line, then follow the gridlines to correct for Pressure Altitude, 1 400 ft and OAT, -10°C. From this intersection continue vertically downward to read the recommended cooling time, approximately 55 minutes. Ιf some credit is given for using reverse thrust, it cannot be taken into account for \"Abandoned Take-offs\" according to CAP 698 paragraph 5.3.1.1, page 49. However, in reality, any reverse thrust application, as an auxiliary means of braking, will decrease the cooling time.

It does not mention this in the question, but the figure attached is the 1 engine inoperative level off graph, and the question asks about which airports are appropriate for landing, so it can be deduced. Of course, when we are looking for a place to make an emergency landing, we want to be able to fly level, and hopefully, have somewhat of a hope at making a go-around. We therefore need to be below the one engine inoperative level off altitude, as the lower we are, the higher the climb performance, and above the level off altitude, we cannot even maintain altitude. Already, we can see that the two lowest airports will be the correct answers, 3 and 4. If you really want to use the graph, then we have to use it backwards, to go from our weight to the level off altitude. We therefore have to apply the corrections first, and have to reverse their direction, so a negative correction is actually an addition to weight. The only addition we need to make is for engine anti-ice ON, which is an extra 1950 kg, making the mass 45 450 kg to enter the graph (just by looking at where the line will go, we can tell that we do not have to apply the correction for A/C AUTO (HIGH) under 17 000 ft. Entering the graph at 45 450 kg at the bottom, going up to the line for ISA +10°C and below, and going to the left gives us 21 900 ft as our level off altitude. This means that Airport 3 and Airport 4 are below our maximum altitude with one engine inoperative, so are usable, but Airport 1 and Airport 2 are above the climb ceiling, so are much less appropriate for a single engine landing.",

If it is crossed outside the shaded area of the top left grid or when there is a tail wind or when employing the improved climb technique, always check VMBE. If V1 exceeds VMBE, apply the correction below the graph. Continue vertically down until intersecting the brake release mass 64000 kg. Finally, move horizontally to the right and read the VMBE 164 kt. Since the horizontal line is crossed outside the shaded area and there is a tailwind, then apply the corrections below the graph. VMBE must be adjusted for slope (-5 kt) and tail wind (-10 kt) giving a new VMBE = 164 kt - 5 kt - 10 kt = 149 kt. V1 exceeds the new VMBE by 2 kt. Therefore, the brake release mass 64 000 kg must be decreased by 300 kg for each knot V1 exceeds VMBE and finally, we get: 64 000 - (2 x 300) = 63 400 kg.

V1 VR V2 146 kt 150 kt 157 kt Then go up to the top table for slope and wind V1 adjustment; this tells us how much to change our V1 speed only due to these factors. We are close to 60 000kg so no need to interpolate between rows, but for our 10 kt tailwind (runway is 010º, wind is 190º - exactly opposite), we have an adjustment of -2 kt (10/15 x -3). For our slope, we have an adjustment of +1 kt (1/2 x 2). After these adjustments (to V1 only), we have the new values: V1 VR V2 145 kt 150 kt 157 kt",

This means that we can focus solely on the \"V speeds\". A Regulated Take-Off Weight (RTOW) table is a simplified form of table to use and is produced for a specific aircraft type on a particular runway and shows MTOM and speeds for a variety of temperatures and pressure altitudes, sometimes giving different configuration options. First of all, the wind direction 050o is exactly opposite to the runway 05L, so the wind speed of 5 kt is a headwind. The questions asks to take the most conservative data and not interpolate, so, enter the RTOW table from the \"0 kt\" column. Enter the table from the left on the assumed temperature of 59ºC. This gives us an uncorrected RTOW of 70.7 tonnes, and uncorrected V speeds of 35-35-40, which correspond to V1 (135 kt), VR (135 kt) and V2 (140 kt), accordingly. We must then correct the V speeds for the other conditions given in the question. The assumed temperature and RTOW are not relevant to the question, so we do not need to worry about correcting for them. The correction for PACKS ON makes the new V speeds 133-134-139 The correction for Anti-ice (ENG only) makes the new V speeds 132-133-137 The correction for the WET runway makes the final V speeds 126-130-135 There is no correction for the QNH as it only applies to when the pressure is lower than standard. Thus, the take-off speeds are: V1 = 126 kt, VR = 130 kt, V2 = 135 kt.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question has been reported a couple of times with varying levels of feedback. Different values of brake energy have been seen on some counts of feedback, but so far this is the most reliable version of this question we can make. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you saw any differences in the real exam, thank you! This scenario can happen during the base training for new pilots to gain a type rating on a jet aircraft, where multiple circuits are performed. Brake usage due to touch and goes, stop and goes, and taxiing can lead to high temperatures. In this case, the pilots want to perform a final landing without reverse thrust, which requires a lot of energy to be absorbed through the brakes. Looking at the brake cooling schedule on figure 4.31 of CAP 698, the 17.6 Million foot-pounds of brake energy already accumulated is within region II, where cooling is recommended, and if another 10 Million foot-pounds are added, the energy is well within region IV, where the fuse plugs are expected to melt. This is therefore very undesirable so the pilots should cool the brakes in the air, by leaving the gear down for the 6 minutes required by the cooling schedule. This should bring the brake energy down to approximately 8 Million foot-pounds remaining, the bottom of region II, and then the aircraft can land safely without reverse thrust, which should bring the total energy back up to around 18 Million foot-pounds, still within region II. As the aircraft remains in Area II after landing, there is a requirement to cool the brakes for about 60 minutes on the ground before another take-off. To look at the other options: Landing now is likely to cause a fuse plug melt, and cooling would have to be greater than 85 minutes after landing anyway. Flying around with the gear up can cool the brakes, but 60 minutes would be required to cool the brakes sufficiently. Again, landing immediately is likely to cause a fuse plug melt, and a possible brake fire.",

The QNH is 5 hPa lower than standard (1013), so we must apply one whole correction for \"QNH (per -10 hPa)\" as no interpolation is allowed. The weight correction of -80kg only takes the RTOW for that assumed temperature down to 71 720 kg, which is still higher than 71 480 kg, so it is acceptable. There is no change to the assumed/flex temperature for this correction. Apply the correction: +1 kt only to the V2 speed, giving a V2 of 144 kt Thus, the appropriate assumed/FLEX temperature is 59°C and the associated take-off speeds are: V1 = 138 kt, VR = 138 kt, V2 = 144 kt.",

There is no row for -3°C, so interpolate between -7°C and +3°C rows. Entering from the top with CONF 1+F/ HEADWIND 10 KT, the corresponding Performance-Limited TOMs are: 83 300 kg (83.3) for -7°C and 82 800 kg (82.8) for +3°C, decreases 50 kg for each 1°C increase. Thus, the Performance-Limited TOM for -3°C is: 83 300 kg - (4°C x 50 kg) = 83 100 kg. Apply the correction for the QNH difference (1013 hPa - 999 hPa = 14 hPa) to the Performance-Limited TOM: The weight must be reduced by 800 kg (-0.8) for every 10 hPa lower than 1013 hPa, so for 14 hPa lower, the weight reduction must be 1 120 kg (800 kg x 1.4). No corrections for Air conditioning and runway condition are required. Therefore, the Performance-Limited TOM at -3°C will be: 83 100 kg - 1 120 kg = 81980 kg, which is very close to 82 000 kg.

            "explanation": "VMBE is the maximum brake energy speed. It is the speed which an aircraft can safely stop from, without overloading the brakes with energy. The brakes take the vast majority of an aircraft's kinetic energy in as heat, so will have a limit on the temperature they can withstand, which equates to a maximum energy they can stop, before overheating and causing effects like brake fade, brake fires and melting thermal fuses. VMBE obviously varies a lot on weight, and the heavier an aircraft is, the more kinetic energy it has at the same speed, so the lower the VMBE. It is an upper limit of V1, the take-off decision speed. For this question, they have given us the conditions, and are asking at what point VMBE will begin to limit the MTOM. Effectively, we want to find the weight at which the VMBE becomes equal to (or below) the V1 in the question. Firstly though, we have to make a couple of corrections for wind and slope. Usually, a pilot would take the uncorrected VMBE using the graph, then apply corrections to it to get the actual VMBE to compare against the V1. We are going to go the other way, taking the V1 and reversing those corrections to get an uncorrected VMBE which we can enter the graph with. With 0.5% upslope, the VMBE would increase by 1 kt, and with 10 kt headwind, the VMBE would increase by a further 3 kt, so we are going to take 4 kts away from our V1 to get our uncorrected VMBE. 149 - 4 = 145 kt (uncorrected VMBE which can be used in the graph) Entering the graph from the top left with the pressure altitude of 111 ft (QNH = 1013 hPa so no pressure correction) and going down at the OAT of 41ºC gives us a vertical line, which we can match up with a horizontal line from 145 kt at the bottom right of the graph. It shows us that the MTOM where the VMBE becomes limiting is much higher than the 68 000 kg shown on the chart. Therefore, the answer is \"In excess of 68 000 kg\".",

For example, for a given aerodrome, which has its own pressure altitude, as the temperature increases, then the Take-off Tyre Speed-limited mass decreases. For this question, since the vertical line does not intersect the pressure altitude of 85 ft, that means that for this aerodrome under these ambient conditions and with this specific flaps configuration, the Take-off mass is not performance limited because of the Tyre speed limit, thus the tyre speed limit it is not a limiting factor for determining the Maximum Allowable Take-off mass.

After any significant braking, due to landing or a rejected take-off, the aircraft brakes will be hot, and may need some time to cool down before being usable again. We use this graph to calculate the brake energy, and required cooling. Entering the graph near the top on the left with 51 000 kg landing weight (in the \"Landing Mass\" section, not RTO mass), go across until the point referencing the relevant brakes on speed. Now in this question we only know the VREF, which is the speed over the threshold, and we add 150% of the 6 kt tailwind, so 9 kt, to this speed. This means we can assume our brakes on speed is 132 + 9 = 141 kt. Of course there will be some deceleration in the flare, but the question will specify an amount to reduce the VREF by if they want you to do so, so we can leave it in this question. Going across to the interpolated position of 141 kt, then directly down to the pressure altitude section. As the QNH is exactly standard pressure setting, no pressure correction is required, and we can use 280 ft pressure altitude. In reality that is almost nothing different from sea level, and the line moves a tiny amount to the right. Going down to the OAT section, account for the temperature being 19ºC, the line goes to the right again. Then head down to the reference line for the autobrake/reversers section. As we want to have a turnaround of 25 minutes, take a separate line up from 25 minutes (PARKED) cooling time, and go straight up. If our final result is to the left of this line, less than 25 minutes of cooling is required, and we can make the turnaround work. From the original (red) line above, the only way to get left of the new (blue) line is to use NORMAL REVERSE #2 DETENT, and Autobrake setting #1 or #2. No other combination would allow less than 25 minutes cooling period. There is no restriction for calculating turnaround time based on using reverse thrust, in fact it is very common to do so.",

It is therefore based on single engine climb performance. Therefore, the OLTOM will be increased when climb performance is good, due to high air density (low density altitude), caused by low temperatures and high atmospheric pressure. This is mostly due to higher thrust output in denser air. The OLTOM is also improved by the presence of a headwind, which will increase the actual climb angle for the same rate of climb, due to the lower groundspeed, although only 50% of the headwind can be accounted for during planning. High temperatures would decrease the OLTOM due to reduced thrust, and contaminated runways would affect the FLLTOM (Field Length Limited Take-Off Mass), not the OLTOM.",

This means that we cannot use Runway 02 without reducing the mass, either by defuelling or offloading passengers or baggage. Neither of these is good for safety or for business, but what about using the other runway? Well by running the graph for Runway 02, we can get the parameters of the pressure altitude and OAT (we do not care about the values, as long as we know where the final line is on the graph, we can use the same line for Runway 20). So by running the Runway 02 figures (blue line), and using the FLLTOM of 58 200 kg, we get the green line indicating the pressure altitude and OAT input. We can then run the graph for the Runway 20 parameters (1% downslope, flaps 15, 5 knots tailwind) in the red line to get a FLLTOM of 58 800 kg. So even with a 5 knot tailwind (which is within limits), the other factors are enough to make Runway 20 viable in current conditions at current weight, and the aircraft can take-off on that runway, accepting that extra 600 kg in MTOM in comparison to Runway 02",

We then have to take any extra factors into account; in this case, we apply a negative factor for QNH pressures below 1013, per each 10 hPa lower QNH. As the QNH is 985 hPa, it is 28 hPa lower than 1013 hPa as assumed in the graph, so we use the most conservative figure, which is a decrease of 30 hPa (as we can only work in multiples of 10). This is a MTOM reduction of 3 x 80 = 240 kg. We will also have to account for the fact that our engine anti-icing is on, which is an MTOM reduction of 380 kg.

You then go to that subsection of the main table in figure 4.9 to read off the V1 - VR - V2 speeds for a particular take-off weight. In our case, we had to interpolate slightly between the 50 and 55 tonne rows for our actual take-off mass of 50.8 tonnes, which gave us 125, 126, 135 when rounded. As the V1 was around the region of the shaded area, it had to be checked that the V1 was not less than the VMCG with the table below, and after inputting the OAT of 42ºC, the VMCG was way below the V1, so no problem there. Usually, the V1 would have to be adjusted for any wind or runway slope, but as the slope was only 0.1% and the wind was a full crosswind (no head or tailwind component), no adjustment was necessary. This leaves us with te answer we found from the table earlier; V1 = 125 kt, VR = 126 kt, V2 = 135 kt.",

Thus, so as to find the fuel flow per engine at FL340 and a mass of 55000 kg, interpolate between the marked boxes as After the interpolation, the fuel flow per engine will be: (1 142 kg/hr + 1 079 kg/hr + 1 159 kg/hr + 1 097 kg/hr) / 4 = 1 119.25 kg/hr. Therefore, the hourly fuel flow is: 1 119.25 kg/hr x 2 = 2 238 kg/hr.",

First of all, start by eliminating the distractors in the question. Neither QNH 1013, nor visibility 500m have any effect. The former because the chart is for QNH 1013 hPa and the latter because OAT is 12ᴼ C, so anti-ice is not required. The wind direction 230o is exactly opposite to the runway 23L, so the wind speed 5 kt is a headwind. Enter from 5 kt headwind, by interpolating between 0 kt and +10 kt. Move down looking for MTOMs which bracket 71 T. Interpolation between 70.7 and 71.7 give a MTOM of 71.2 and this equates to flex temperature: 59ᴼC. Limitation codes can be ignored because the question does not ask for them. V-speeds are given interpolated: V1: 137, VR: 137, V2: 141 kt (round up for half knots rather than down because we might be VMCG-limited).

Move horizontally to the left until 2 000 ft Pressure altitude, of the left Pressure Altitude set of lines you meet (Anti-skid: Operative). 4. Continue vertically down until the flaps position 30⁰ and move parallel with the grid lines until the flap position reference line. 5. Continue further down until reaching at the 10 kt headwind. No correction required for DRY runway condition, because DRY is exactly on the runway condition reference line. 6. Move parallel with the wind grid lines until the wind reference line. 7. Finally, continue vertically down to get the Minimum Field Length Required 4 700 ft.",

Apply the corrections to V1: 145 kt - 1(for downslope) -1(for tailwind)= 143 kt. Thus, the take-off speeds are V1=143 kt, VR=148 kt, V2=155 kt.",

This is a quite straightforward graph, which helps to find the maximum one-engine inoperative net level-off height for different temperature conditions and configurations: 1. Enter with the expected gross mass 66 000 kg and draw a vertical line upwards, until intersecting the ISA+15ºC dotted curve (dotted curves are for LRC, while bold lines for Green Dot speeds. 2.
