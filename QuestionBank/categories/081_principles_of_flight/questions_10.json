            "explanation": "\"By fitting winglets to the wing tip, the strength of the wingtip vortices is reduced, which in turn reduces induced drag.\" Correct. Winglets are small vertical aerofoils that are integrated into the wingtip. These generate a slight forward force and disrupt the airflow from the lower to the upper surface of the wing, diminishing the intensity of the wingtip vortex. Both effects contribute to a reduction in induced drag. Let's examine the remaining options and discuss why they are incorrect: \"Slat extension, at a constant angle of attack and normal extension speeds, will increase the lift coefficient, which will also increase the induced drag coefficient.\" Incorrect. At a constant aircraft angle of attack, the extension of slats decreases the angle of attack on the specific wing section, preventing an increase in the lift coefficient (CL). The advantage of slats becomes evident when the aircraft's angle of attack is subsequently increased. \"Sweepback reduces drag since, compared with a straight wing of equal area, the span increases.\" Incorrect. Sweepback actually reduces the wingspan, thereby lowering the aspect ratio and increasing induced drag. \"Vortex generators on the wing partially block the spanwise flow over the wing, leading to a reduction in induced drag.\" Incorrect. Vortex generators are designed to energize the boundary layer, but they typically contribute to increased drag rather than inducing a reduction in induced drag.",

            "explanation": "Slats and flaps increase lift. This can help the aircraft take off with a shortened ground roll, as the aircraft generates more lift at a lower speed with flaps and slats extended. However, flaps and slats shorten the ground roll, but also decrease climb performance as they generate drag. Therefore, after takeoff these two devices are retracted. Flaps and slats both decrease stall speed, but flaps generate much more drag. The flaps are therefore retracted first and slats afterwards. Flaps increase CL for a specific angle of attack, giving a wing with flaps extended a higher CL and therefore higher lift than a wing without. Flaps also increase CLMAX and the CD for a wing, they decrease critical AoA. Slats do not necessarily increase CL for a specific AoA, but they increase the value for CLMAX, meaning that the aircraft stalls at a much higher AoA than normal. They also increase the drag a little on the wing where they are extended. Flaps increase lift, but this question states straight and level flight. If we want to remain in level flight, lift should not be increased because otherwise the aircraft will climb. Therefore the AoA will have to be decreased and the CL will remain the same, drag will increase and CLMAX will be increased. Note: Drag and Lift stay constant. At straight and level flight which means Lift=Weight (constant). IAS is said to have remained constant as well. Remember the lift and drag formula.",

Air comes in under constant pressure (which we will call X from this point onwards) and is directed through the tube. At a certain point in time, the tube starts becoming tighter. However, the same amount of air still has to travel through this (now tighter) tube (we call this airflow Y). It does so by flowing faster than before. This increased airspeed creates a lower pressure at the tighter part of the venturi, while the wider part still has its original pressure and airspeed. After the tightening, the tube becomes wider again and the air returns to its original static pressure and airspeed (airflow Z). It now has the properties of airflow X again. Before the venturi (airflow X) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal In the throat (airflow Y) Total pressure same as airflow X and Z Static Pressure low Speed of the airflow increased After the venturi (airflow Z) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal The venturi works on Bernoulli’s principle. Bernoulli’s principle states that in increase in speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the fluid’s static pressure. The formula for this principle = Total pressure = static pressure + dynamic pressure. If airspeed increases, the static pressure decreases and dynamic pressure increases, keeping total pressure the same.",

As the angle of attack increases, the lift coefficient rises until reaching its maximum value (CLMAX), corresponding to the critical angle of attack.

This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, the lift decreases when leaving ground effect, and this is more prominent on a low-wing aeroplane where the wings are naturally much closer to the ground.",

            "explanation": "Important Note: This was fed back to us without the correct answer being known. In this form, the options are quite vague and we could discuss which is correct for a long time and likely never reach an answer. Therefore, we have used our experience with the authorities to give our \"best guess\" of their correct answer. Obviously, the question could well be better worded in the real exam and with good knowledge of this subject, would likely be much easier to answer. Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, any differences you noticed from our version, and if you have any idea of the correct answer with your exam authority, thank you! Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and improve slow flying characteristics. There are both leading edge devices (LE flaps, kreuger flaps and slats) and trailing edge high lift devices (TE flaps of many kinds). Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly slower, and they do this by increasing the CLMAX of the wings, so that the lift will be enough to counteract weight, even at lower airspeeds. The greater the CLMAX becomes, the lower the stall speed. Secondary effects are increased drag and a change to the wing's chord line and angle of incidence, allowing the aircraft to fly with different pitch attitudes, which can be useful for pilot vision during landing. Let's go through the options now. \"Leading edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than trailing edge flaps because they enhance the wing’s curvature, increasing lift at lower speeds.\" This is not strictly true. Whilst leading edge flaps do enhance the wing's curvature, so do trailing edge flaps, and they both increase the maximum available lift at all speeds. \"Trailing edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than leading edge flaps by increasing the wing area and camber, enhancing lift.\" This is also very difficult to justify, as their increase in CLMAX depends on the TE/LE flaps used and to what degree. Also, not all flaps increase the wing area, only fowler flaps and some variations upon them. Again, TE and LE flaps both increase CLMAX. \"Both leading edge and trailing edge flaps have the same effect on reducing stall speed by equally increasing the wing's lift capabilities.\" For us, this seems most likely to be correct. They both reduce the stall speed by increasing the lifting capability of the wing, allowing the aircraft to fly slower before stalling. \"Equally\" is a bad word to use though, as they could definitely have a different amount of effect, but it is not for us to say if they do, or which is most \"useful\". \"Neither leading edge nor trailing edge flaps significantly reduce the stall speed; they primarily affect the aircraft's drag.\" Obviously incorrect, as they both do significantly reduce the stall speed.",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Since the climb angle is based on thrust and drag: Sin (γ) = (T – D) / W We know that we need to minimize drag as much as possible to get the best climb performance. Therefore lower flaps will be used. High flaps setting usually provide only a slight increase in lift whilst adding a large amount of drag. Approach and landing – The aircraft will be flying again at slow speeds, therefore to increase the safety margin we want a higher CLMAX and therefore a slower stall speed. Secondly, we are in a descent, therefore we can afford to have much more drag than during the departure. Therefore we use a large flap setting which will also create high levels of drag.",

Flaps also change the chord line of the wing, allowing a more nose-down attitude for better pilot visibility and easier landings. Flaps increase lift by increasing the camber of the wing, and often also increasing the wing area, depending on the style of flaps. This helps the aircraft gain more lift for the same airflow. An aircraft only needs enough lift to counteract its own weight in normal operations (and a little more in turns), so there is no need for more lift, only to fly slower, with the same amount of lift. The increased drag also comes from the increased camber and wing area, as this makes the wing less efficient, with a lower lift-to-drag ratio. The steeper the flap angle, the higher the drag they will produce, and this is parasite drag, which increases with the square of the speed. As the aircraft is maintaining the same flight path angle, the lift must remain the same, which removes the answer where lift increases.",

The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed). Therefore, a sudden increase in CAS, due to something like an increase in headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a momentary increase of airspeed, which eventually recues back to the original airspeed.",

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), but this is not the answer to the question as increased drag is just a side effect, and does not allow us to fly slower without stalling.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The main factors affecting induced drag are wing planform, aspect ratio, speed, and weight/lift. The effect of planform is the principal factor affecting induced drag. The size of the wing tip vortex is directly related to the length of the wing tip chord. A rectangular planform wing produces a much larger vortex than the tapered section. This is because the longer the tip chord, the greater the spillage of air from the lower surface onto the upper surface, and the larger the wing tip vortex. In aerodynamic terms, the elliptical planform wing is the most aerodynamically efficient because the downwash remains constant across the complete wingspan, giving minimal induced drag.",

When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed, the boundary layer is re-energized. The effect of the slat is to prolong the lift curve by delaying boundary layer separation until a higher angle of attack. The magnitude of the increase to CLMAX and the extent of the decrease to the stalling speed are directly proportional to the length of the leading edge of the aerofoil covered by the slat and the chord of the slat itself, i.e. the longer the slat the greater the CLMAX and the lower the stalling speed.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions.",

Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

On a cambered aerofoil even though the centre of pressure (CP) moves with the changing angle of attack, the lift is assumed to act through the aerodynamic centre (AC). The combination of the AC and the pitching moment coefficient are required for the analysis of the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. The tailplane is a major contributor to the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. To maintain a particular angle of attack a specific deflection of the elevator is established that will maintain this requirement.

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π * AR Where, CDI– Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Decreasing the speed of an aircraft maintaining straight and level flight will increase its angle of attack and therefore increase the CL.

            "explanation": "The attached figure shows aerofoil sections with different thickness and camber combinations producing specific Lift Coefficient (CL) against Angle of Attack (α) plots. - An increase in the thickness of a symmetrical aerofoil gives a higher CLMAX. - The introduction of camber also has a beneficial effect on CLMAX. The importance of maximum lift coefficient is that the greater the CLMAX, the lower the minimum flight speed (stall speed). If an aerofoil section of greater camber is used to give a lower minimum flight speed, the efficient cruise speed will be lower due to o the generation of excessive drag. It is better to use an aerofoil section that is efficient at high cruise speed, with the ability to temporarily increase the camber of the wing when it is necessary to fly slowly. In the figure is also dipected that the CL increases with increasing Angle of Attack until the point of CLMAX, where an increase in Angle of Attack leads to a decrease in CL. In this exercice there are two airfoils: - airfoil 1 and 2 are identical, with airfoil 2 at a higher angle of attack - airfoil 3 and 4 are identical, with airfoil 4 at a higher angle of attack Airfoil 1 and 2 have a higher thickness and camber when compared to airfoil 3 and 4. From this we can conclude that: - Airfoil 3 is producing the least CL as it has the least camber, thickness and angle of attack; - Airfoil 4 produces more CL than airfoil 3 because it has a higher angle of attack - Airfoil 1 prduces more CL than the previous ones due to its camber and thickness - Airfoil 2 produces the most CL because of its camber, thickness and higher angle of attack. Knowing this, we can select the correct option: 3, 4, 1, 2.",

As for the other options, the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass. That is the point through which the weight force acts. The aerodynamic centre is a bit more complicated, as it is a point on a wing (aerofoil) where the turning force of the aerodynamic forces around it remains the same, usually at around 25% chord for subsonic flow.

Downwash can also be the change in airflow angle that wingtip vortices cause, but we don't think the question is referring directly to that. When flaps are extended, the aircraft can fly slower without stalling as the reduced airflow over the wing is being forced downwards at a steeper angle, which means the downwash angle increases, which means it still produces as much lift as the clean wing at higher speeds. This downwash can have a strong effect on the airflow hitting the horizontal stabiliser though, causing an increase pitch up moment on some aircraft, with the effect varying in strength, depending on where their wings and stabilisers are mounted.",

At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

            "explanation": "A plane can remain in the air by the wings generating lift. If this lift is equal to the weight (and the aircraft is in the air), the aircraft will remain in level flight. A wing operates through the principle of pressure differential and equal and opposite reactions. An aerofoil segment can generate lift by either having an angle of attack to the relative airflow, or but being cambered (bulging more in one direction), or both. Both these things mean that, to create lift upwards, the air flowing over the top of the wing must travel faster than the air underneath the wing, in order to provide a low pressure area above the wing due to the venturi effect. The way this occurs can be thought of through many different approaches, but it is easiest for our purposes just to say that the streamlines of air going over the wing get squashed together more than those under the wing (there is a little more to it, but we don't want to make it any more complex). The venturi effect creates a low pressure area above the wing, and the relatively higher pressure beneath the wing means that there is a net force upwards on the wing (from high to low), which is our lift. The air behind the wing is also given some downwash by this effect, and that satisfies the \"equal and opposite forces\" of Newton's 3rd law, in that the air going downwards forces the aircraft to go upwards. It is important to know that the low pressure air is the main contributor to the lifting effect, and not the \"high\" pressure beneath the wing, as that is only high relative to the low, not relative to ambient pressure.",

            "explanation": "Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Additional Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed the boundary layer is re-energised. If Kinetic Energy is added to the boundary layer, boundary layer separation will be delayed to a much higher angle of attack. In terms of the pressure distribution of the aerofoil with a slat extended, the slat provides a fair amount of lift itself due to its shape, and when extended, it flattens the peak of the low pressure zone somewhat, allowing the low pressure zone to be more evenly distributed over the top of the aerofoil. It increases the suction overall as it allows a much higher critical AoA and higher CLMAX, as the adverse pressure gradient occurs more gradually, delaying the stall. Furthermore, the suction peak flattens, it does not move. This is why the CL location does not change very much when extending flaps. Note: We are aware that the wording of the correct option here is a little off regarding the suction peak, as the peak should reduce, but the overall suction increases. We think this could be what the examiner is trying to say. We still think it is the most correct option by far out of the available options, but please send us any further feedback if you see this question in the exam, thank you!",

The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50%. Lift (CLMAX) The larger the angle of attack, the larger the decrease of CL with a maximum decrease at CLMAX Drag More skin friction drag results in overall more drag and earlier boundary layer separation. In significant icing condition, ice build-up can also increase the form or pressure drag Stall Speed Due to decrease of CLMAX and increase of the aircraft weight, stall speed will increase. Critical Angle of Attack Increased surface friction results in quicker flow separation. This reduces the critical angle of attack and a stall will occur sooner. Stability The decreased CLMAX of the tailplane could cause a stal when the aircraft is flying at low speed and with an increased downwash due to flap extension. A tailplane stall will result in loss of longitudinal control. The changed CL of the main wing will create some small changes in the pitching moment.",

            "explanation": "Camber is the asymmetry between two acting surfaces on an airfoil. For an aircraft, this is the top and the bottom of the wing. Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

Typical aspect ratios vary from 35 for a high-performance sailplane to as low as 3 for a jet fighter. The aspect ratio of a modern high-speed jet transport is about 12. Aspect Ratio is the measure of Span divided by Chord. As many wing planforms have variable chord lengths, there is a second formula which uses wing area instead, which effectively just makes use of the \"average chord\". AR = b/c or, AR = b2 /S Where: AR - Aspect Ratio b - Span c - Average Chord S - Wing Area Therefore, for this wing, the aspect ratio can be calculated in a few different ways. The easiest is to just to say that the average chord is 1.25 m, and span / chord = 12.5 / 1.25 = 10. Alternatively, you can calculate the wing area as two trapeziums (or any other way) as 2 x 6.25 x ((1 + 1.5) / 2) which gets you to 15.625 m2, and then do span2 / wing area, which is 12.52 / 15.625 = 10.",

            "explanation": "The polar diagram of CL vs CD is a very common one to be used in the exams. It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. We can therefore imagine what each of the options would do to the graph, and measure that up with the annex in the question. \"Flaps\" Flaps increase our CLMAX and also increase drag, so the graph would move up and to the right, which is not the same as the annex. \"Landing Gear\" Landing Gear won't affect our lift, but they will increase drag, so the graph will move to the right only, not downwards like we see in the annex. \"Lift dumpers\" Lift dumpers such as wing spoilers reduce lift (as per their name) by ruining the airflow over the wing, and increase drag through this very same method, and by putting an obstruction in the airflow. They would cause the graph to go down and to the right, which matches up with the annex. \"Slats\" Slats allow an increase in the CLMAX as they allow for higher angles of attack to be flown, but they do not increase drag by very much, so the graph would move upwards, with perhaps a slight movement to the right near the top.",

It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

Their main contribution is to increase the maximum lift coefficient, but not increase the lift coefficient at a certein AoA. The negative influence of extending slats is a slight increase in drag. Therefore we can say that at a certain AoA, slats will not increase lift, but they will increase drag slightly, therefore the only resultant moment will be a yaw. Flaps are aerodynamic surfaces that extended from the trailing edge of the wing. Their main purpose is to increase the camber of the wing to increase the coefficient of lift for a certain AoA. This can be seen on the figure. Their main contribution to the wing is extra lift. Whilst drag is also a side effect, lift it more significant.

We also require as much feedback from the real exam as possible to try and make this question more accurate, so please do let us know if you see this question, and anything you can remember from it, thank you. When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its induced drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus upwash and downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash/Upwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash/Upwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. (So the AoA increases to maintain lift) The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. In terms of the forces on the controls, it's a tricky one to answer. The forces will change on the elevators as elevators feel the reduced downwash behind the main wings when in ground effect, giving a pitch down moment, so a pitch-up moment is expected upon leaving the ground effect. However, this is not \"lighter\" or \"heavier\" controls. We believe that there is no consistent change, but please let us know if this is marked as incorrect in the exam and we can look into changing this. The learning objectives do not mention this, but they are also quite vague on this matter so do not remove it completely.",

Parasite drag increases with the square of the speed, induced drag changes with the inverse square of the speed (highest at low speeds). Together, they create the familiar drag curve of an aircraft. Sometimes, we have to convert that graph again, from drag (thrust required) to something more friendly to propeller aircraft. Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; the power required curve will look almost the same (There is a slight flat section of figure 2 but it is not important, imagine it looks the same as the others), but for each point on the curve, the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards). It must be figure 2.",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated.

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that arrow 3 is correct. Although the lift is the larger force, the proportional increase in the drag is greater, and so the maximum lift/drag ratio decreases.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. These are obviously where the air is hitting the aircraft, and therefore some of the SCWDs will hit the airframe. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example. When it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warning that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

The angle of attack therefore massively affects the coefficient of lift of an aerofoil. In the sense that increasing the angle of attack increases the wing's coefficient of lift in a mostly linear fashion, up until the critical angle of attack, when the wing stalls and any further increase in angle of attack causes a steep drop-off in lift coefficient. There is a graph to show this relationship, the CL vs Alpha (AoA) graph. The X-axis of the graph is the angle of attack (AoA) (α - Greek letter Alpha), and when the AoA is zero, a symmetrical aerofoil will not have any lift (well more precisely, it has both upwards and downwards lift of equal amounts which cancel out). However, a positively cambered aerofoil will produce some lift at zero degrees angle of attack, depending on how much camber is present. The Y-axis of the graph is the coefficient of lift (CL). This means that the graph for a symmetrical aerofoil will go straight through the origin, as 0º AoA = 0 lift, so CL = 0. A positively cambered aerofoil will have some lift at 0º AoA, so will have a line that crosses the Y axis above the origin. In this question, then, a symmetrical aerofoil's CL vs Alpha graph will cross the Y-axis and X-axis at the same point, so the question is asking about the origin of the graph, which means zero lift is being produced at that point.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "Note: Beware of the difference between lift force distribution and coefficient of lift distribution. Questions like this one have never been asked about before to our knowledge, so read the following explanation to understand the difference. The planform of a wing is a fancy way of saying the shape of the wing when looked on from above. Wings can be made in many different planforms, which all have different properties, ranging from their spanwise lift distributions to their stall characteristics, transonic flight characteristics, ease of construction, etc. Spanwise lift distribution is exactly as it sounds. It refers to the lift produced by each point on the wing, running laterally from the root to the tip. The simplest wing, a rectangular wing, has a spanwise lift distribution that is mostly flat, but drops off near the tip. This is not the most efficient planform for creating lift, as the high lift near to the tip (before the drop off) causes strong vortices, which cause induced drag. An elliptical planform, however, is much more efficient when it comes to induced drag. An elliptical planform wing has much lower induced drag due to its shape, and the spanwise distribution of the lift force starts higher, and has a more gradual drop off towards the tip. This means that much smaller wingtip vortices are formed, as there is not much lift being created around the tip. (see bottom figure in annex Now an elliptical wing is sometimes said to have a \"flat\" lift distribution, but that is referring to the coefficient of lift. The coefficient of lift of an elliptical wing stays almost constant along the whole span of the wing (top figure in annex), but because the actual chord line of the wing becomes gradually shorter towards the tip, the lift force decreases (as per the lift equation, where chord length directly influences wing area [S]). There are a few more complex reasons why this is so good for reducing induced drag, but we are not going to go into them. We are frankly surprised that the examiner has gone this far into the technicalities of wing planforms, as they have previously used greater oversimplifications.",

Please let us know if you see this in the exam so we can verify it, as well as which authority you sat your exam under, thank you! The centre of pressure of a wing (aerofoil) is dictated by the pressure layout around the wing. This pressure layout changes dramatically depending on the shape, angle of attack, and speed of the relative airflow. The centre of pressure is kind of the \"average\" point of the pressure layout, where the sum of all the pressures acts through on the aerofoil. It is therefore the point through which the lift and drag act. It moves, depending on the angle of attack of a wing. For a positively cambered (normal) aerofoil in standard flight, the CP moves further towards the leading edge as the angle of attack increases, up until the stall. The aerodynamic centre is slightly more complex. When you add up all the forces on an aerofoil, there will be a resultant force through the centre of pressure, and this is split into lift and drag. The centre of pressure will not have any turning force around it, only forces acting directly through it. However, every other point on the wing will have a force acting around it, imagine holding the leading edge of an aerofoil in a wind tunnel, not only would it try and pull away from you, but it would also try to twist due to these moments. There is a point where the moments (turning forces around that point) stay the same, no matter the angle of attack (for the same IAS). This is called the aerodynamic centre, and it does not move (for a range of normal angles of attack and in the low subsonic speed regime). As you can see from the figure, the CP is behind the AC, and for normal ranges of flight, this will be the case.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE The strength and size of the vortices produced by an aeroplane are dependent on the amount of lift produced. Strong vortices are produced by large transport aeroplanes that create a significant amount of turbulence behind the aeroplane along the path of the aircraft. The disturbance so caused can extend for a considerable distance and last for several minutes. This is wake turbulence that can seriously affect the controllability of following aeroplanes if they are too close. The severity of the turbulence so created is categorised to enable following pilots to assess the difficulties that may be encountered. The larger, heavier aeroplanes create the worst turbulence that will cause problems to following pilots particularly when close to the ground during take-off or landing. Pilots are advised by the aviation authorities of the minimum distance and/or time separation from the aeroplane ahead deemed to be safe, to avoid having control problems. The minimum separation distance and/or time is based on the relative sizes of the aeroplanes concerned. Wake turbulence is affected by the height of the aeroplane and the prevailing wind conditions. The downwash of the airflow behind the aeroplane causes the vortices to descend to one thousand feet below the aeroplane. However, at low height, when the aeroplane is in ground effect, the vortices move outward from the path of the aeroplane over the ground. But any cross wind between 5 kt and 10 kt will prevent this happening to the upwind vortex and will keep it on the aircraft’s track. It is particularly important during the take-off phase that the following aircraft complies with the advised separation because of this. Aircraft mass, speed, aspect ratio and trailing-edge flap setting influence the strength of the vortices. The vortex strength is greatest for heavy aeroplanes at low airspeed and in the clean configuration, which is just after rotation at take-off. Vortices only cease when the nose-wheel touches down during landing ground run.",

For subsonic flow, the air is incompressible (its density remains constant) thus, for subsonic flow: A1* V1 = A2* V2 = A3* V3 = constant. From figure 1, we can then conclude that sections with smaller area have an increase in speed. These areas are also where streamlines appear closer together. This can be used to make an analogy with an airfoil where streamlines are enclosed into a streamtube (figure 2).

The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtipsand become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, increasing the angle of attack increases CL, which increases Induced drag.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 has significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0° AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber. We can assume from the question text that the other lines represent different configurations of the same aerofoil, so our answer is symmetrical aerofoil with trailing edge flaps extended.",

In practice, they increase critical angle of attack as well. When the aircraft is at lower angles of attack (i.e. 5 degrees) the diagram shows that deployment of Trailing Edge (TE) flaps increases CL by much more than LE devices. This is because TE flap deployment increases local alpha, whereas LE devices reduce local alpha on the part of the wing where they are deployed. However, CL is still boosted a little, because LE devices increase camber and also increase the mass flow over the upper surface of the wing. This means that the airflow over the top of the wing has more kinetic energy, and the forward movement of the separation point at high alpha will be delayed. Therefore, we can increase AOA and CL beyond the point at which airflow over the wing without LE devices would have separated and we would stall. LE devices enable aircraft alpha to increase to a higher value before the stall, at which point CLMAX has a higher value than when TE flaps are deployed.",

As 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour, we have to multiply by the amount of metres in a nautical mile (1852) and then divide by the amount of seconds in an hour (3600). Velocity = 73 kt x 1852/3600 = 37.55 m/s We are going to rearrange the formula to find the CL, and that means we need to have a value for the lift produced by the wing. As we are in straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, so we just need the weight of the aircraft. Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity (G). Therefore; Lift = Weight = 7300 x 9.81 = 71613 N Referring to the rearranged equation in the annex above; CL = (2 x 71613) / (1.225 x (37.55)2 x 49) = 1.69",

The first is to use the lift formula: LIFT = ½ x ρ x V2 x S x CL and determine that in order to keep straight and level flight (L=W), an increase in speed must be balanced with a decrease in CL, which is achieved by decreasing the angle of attack. The other part is to establish a relationship between induced drag and speed. From the graph attached to this explanation, we can conclude that an increase in speed leads to an decrease in induced drag. If you refer to the second attached figure, we can conclude how the Effective Airflow, Effective Angle of Attack, and Induced Drag behave: Wing tip vortices create certain vertical velocity components in the airflow in the vicinity of the wing, both in front of and behind it. These vertical velocities strengthen upwash and downwash, which reduce the effective angle of attack. The stronger the vortices, the greater the reduction in effective angle of attack. The effective angle of attack is the actual or effective angle of attack at the aerofoil. In level flight at a given mass the lift generated is the same at all forward speeds above the stalling speed. Because the angle of attack must decrease with increasing speed the same downwash speed has less effect at a high speed than it does at a low forward speed because it has a smaller downwash vector. Thus, the downwash angle is less at higher speeds than it is at lower forward speeds. Therefore, the induced drag is decreased at high speeds.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The induced angle of attack increases. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag.

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. The CL/CD ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore the highest value of the CL/CD ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane.",

The graph for krueger flaps is not quite a simple as but for this question it is fine to use. Slats - These are small \"extra leading edges\" that move forward in front of the leading edge of the wing, creating a small slot behind, where airflow is sped up and re-energised, delaying the stalling angle of attack without increasing the CL at normal angles of attack. Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. For this question, the slats are the only leading edge device that fit the graph perfectly, and this is a very common high-lift device to use in questions, due to the distinctive CL vs AoA graph, so be familiar with it. \"Fowler Flap\" Incorrect.

The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed). Therefore, a sudden increase in headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a momentary increase of airspeed, which eventually settles back to the original airspeed.",

Please do inform us in the comments if you see this question, and also if you have any further feedback to add, thank you! Learning Objective 081.01.04.02.01: Describe the general streamline pattern around the wing, tail section, and fuselage. Learning Objective 081.01.04.02.02: Explain and describe the causes of spanwise flow over top and bottom surfaces. The streamlines of air around an aeroplane just depict the path that air particles take past the aircraft in flight, so primarily front to back, and they have to move out of the way of the aircraft's fuselage, wings, tail fin, engine nacelles, etc. Any time streamlines converge (come together), the air accelerates and the static pressure drops, and any time they diverge (get further apart), the airspeed drops and the static pressure rises, which brings about pressure distributions, lift and drag forces on the aircraft. 2 dimensional streamlines around the wing cross-section are shown in the first image above, but this question is certainly asking about 3 dimensional airflow, and that gets more complicated. The main area of 3D airflow is spanwise flow over the wings and wingtip vortices, which are effectively the same thing. Because wings are not infinitely long, there has to be a wingtip somewhere, and high pressure air from under the wing can cheat the system by going round the tip and getting to the upper wing surface. as streamlines of air affect the other nearby streamlines, this means that the air under the wing has a \"spanwise\" flow outwards, and the air on top of the wing has a spanwise flow inwards. When these two flows meet at the rear of the wing, they swirl around each other, causing vortices, strongest at the wingtip and getting weaker towards the wing root. This creates a familiar wingtip vortex area as shown above. Now for the answers. None of them are very good so we have chosen the best in our opinion as the correct one. \"The streamlines typically follow the direction of the lateral axis of the aeroplane and remain attached along the entire length of the aeroplane.\" Definitely incorrect. The lateral axis goes from left to right, and the streamlines go from front to back. \"The streamlines typically follow the contours of the fuselage, but they will have a slight spanwise flow producing a lift-like force.\" Likely incorrect. They do indeed follow the contours of the fuselage, but \"spanwise flow\" means from left to right, because it is along the wingspan, and this doesn't really hold true for fuselage airflow, and doesn't really produce any such lift-like force that we can think of. \"On the entire aft section of the fuselage, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Maybe incorrect. This one depends on the wording, but worded like this, we would say it is incorrect. A corkscrew pattern around the entire aft section of the fuselage sounds like what happens behind a nose-mounted propeller, but that wasn't specified in the question. Wingtip vortices (which we suspect are the purpose of the question) cause two vortices, spiralling in opposite directions, and stray far from the aft fuselage. \"Across the entire wingspan of the main wings, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Best answer here. The 3 dimensional flow around the wings does make somewhat of a corkscrew pattern, and it is completely because of the wingtip vortex for that wing. The spanwise component of the flow is much greater near the wingtip and very little near the wing root, but it is still there nonetheless, and after the wing becomes very much \"corkscrew-like\".",

This is the \"flow back\" ice that one of the correct statements mentions. It covers over the aerofoil and changes the shape, sometimes quite dramatically. This will decrease the critical angle of attack, and therefore the stalling speed in level flight will increase. Icing of the pitot and static ports is also a problem when dealing with icing conditions. This is why pitot and static probes are heated, to avoid any such issues. If they do become iced over, the pilots may find it difficult to know what airspeed they are flying at, and therefore may be unsure of their angle of attack, which can lead to an unexpected stall.",

The same increase of CL could have been made by increasing the angle of attack, but this might have brought the aircraft close to or past the stalling angle of attack, so flaps might be the best choice. Some may wonder why answer A, \"The new CL is greater than 0.38 because flaps always increase the CL.\", is not correct. It is because flaps do not always increase the CL. If we remain at the same AoA and add flaps, the CL will almost always increase, but this is rarely what we do. If we added flaps but remained at the same speed, and at the same altitude, the CL would stay the same, as none of the components in the Lift equation would have changed. We would then be flying at a lower angle of attack, though, and with higher drag.",

A low-wing aeroplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect, which is only experienced for conventional aeroplanes during the initial climb phase after take-off and the final descent phase during landing. At low airspeeds it is considered that the air is non compressible and, because of the close proximity of the earth’s surface, the upwash of air ahead of the wing is reduced. Thus, because of the diminished negative lift, the downwash over the upper surface of the wing does not have to be as large as it would be normally. This enables the aeroplane to maintain level flight at a lower than usual angle of attack, which decreases the induced drag and improves the efficiency of the wing. The consequences of operating in ground effect at a constant IAS are: - Decreased upwash and downwash angles produce smaller wing-tip vortices. - Increased Cl. - Significantly decreased induced drag coefficient; by approximately 8% at a height equal to half wingspan and reduced by considerably more at any lower height. - Decreased total drag (no effect on parasite drag). - Decreased angle of attack for a given lift coefficient. - Increased angle of attack for a constant IAS. - Decreased stalling angle of attack. - Decreased induced angle of attack. - Increased lift, if the pitch attitude remains constant. - Increased speed for a constant thrust setting. - Increased float distance on landing, if the angle of attack is constant, increasing the total landing distance. - The lift vector is inclined forward, which decreases the thrust required. - Less thrust and power are required to fly at the same speed.",

Please send us any further exam feedback you have, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The figure shows 4 types of flaps: Plain flap -The standard for many light aircraft, increases available lift and increases drag. Easy to manufacture Slotted flap - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft. So from those descriptions, we can definitely see that type 2 (slotted) flaps have a much larger available CL than type 1 (plain) flaps with less drag.",

            "explanation": "Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The vortices induce downwash to the airflow behind the wing, causing the lift vector to tilt rearward. The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. It is advantageous to reduce induced drag to a minimum, and this is achieved using the following design features to minimize the formation of wing tip vortices: Tapering the wing in planform toward the tip reduces the amount of air flowing from the lower surface to the upper surface, thereby reducing the size of the wing tip vortex. Washout means constructing the wing with a small amount of twist from root to tip, so that the inboard wing section is at a higher angle of incidence, and hence a greater angle of attack, compared to the wing tip. This ensures that the inner part of the wing generates most of the lift, thus minimizing the leakage of airflow around the wing tips. This reduces the size of the wing tip vortex and reduces the total amount of induced drag. Wing tip modifications reduce the leakage of airflow around the wing tip and limit the size of the vortex. Some of the more typical designs include winglets, wing tip fence and wing tip tank.",

If we decrease Angle of Attack, lift will be decreased, also decreasing the strength of wing tip vortices. This shows that statement I is incorrect. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square od the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. Statement number II is incorrect, as the correct answer would be “The strength of wing tip vortices increases as the aspect ratio decreases.",

These forces must be in equilibrium during flight. Lift must balance weight and thrust must balance drag. These forces are Lift is defined by: L = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x S x CL For a given wing area (S), if the altitude (i.e. air density) and mass remain constant then the remaining factors in the formula, the coefficient of lift (CL) and the free air velocity (IAS), are variable but have a fixed relationship. CL and IAS must change in such a manner that the total lift formula remains balanced. Lift coefficient increases with angle of attack up to a maximum (CLMAX), which corresponds to the “Critical” angle of attack. Continuing to increase the angle of attack beyond this point makes it impossible for the airflow to maintain its previous smooth flow over the contour of the upper surface, and lift will reduce. This is represented in figure 2. At a constant mass and altitude, if the IAS is increased, the angle of attack must be decreased to maintain level flight otherwise the aeroplane will climb.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy.

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. We have therefore based this answer on feedback and other questions such as 819930 and 815643, but recent feedback is scarce, so please let us know if this is different if you see it in the real exam, thank you!",

The use of flaps on take-off is to allow the aircraft to maintain flight at lower speeds, therefore using less runway whilst accelerating. After take-off, the flaps just increase the aircraft's drag, so reduce the climb capability of the aircraft. Therefore, quite early into the take-off climb, the pilots will retract the flaps, in order to accelerate further and reduce drag. If the flaps are retracted too early, the aircraft may not be flying fast enough to gain sufficient lift with a clean wing, and the aircraft will therefore stall. If the flaps are retracted too late, the aircraft may accelerate past the VFE for that flap setting (maximum speed with flaps extended). Therefore, in this question, where the pilot monitoring has retracted the flaps prematurely (early), there is a potential for the aircraft to be below the new VS, thereby stalling the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback has been a bit contradictory for this question, and it seems very new to the EASA database. Please let us know if you see this question in the exam, and anything you can remember about it. Thank you! The effect of flaps on Take-off Distance (TOD) is as follows: Initially, increasing flap setting (from no flaps) reduces the take-off distance quite significantly as the aircraft can lift-off at a lower speed, reducing the Take-Off Run. The higher the flap setting though, the longer the distance from the lift-off point to reach the screen height, due to more drag. At a certain point though, the extra drag of high flap settings becomes a problem, as the aircraft will require a little more distance to accelerate and much more distance to reach the screen height. This extra distance eventually outweighs the small reduction in lift-off speeds when using high flap settings. The trick with this question is to note that there will be a peak flap setting that provides the minimum TOD, and the manufacturer is likely to make this the maximum allowed flap setting for take-off (if not even a lower flap setting). There is effectively no reason to ever need to take-off with flaps above this setting, and single engine climb gradient would likely be much more limiting by this point anyway. Therefore, it is our opinion that the correct answer is \"Decreases, because the effect on lift-off speed is more significant than the extra drag created.\" Remember, the examiner is asking about a take-off with the maximum allowed take-off flap setting, not full flaps. It is possible the examiner may be actually asking about very high flap settings here, in which case, the answer will change to one that states that the distance increases as the extra drag outweighs the lower lift-off speed, but for now, we think that is not the purpose of this question, and if so, would require an appeal due to incorrect wording.",

Therefore, if dynamic pressure increases then static pressure decreases and vice versa. If the static pressure on one side of a body is reduced more than on the other side, a pressure differential will exist. The actual pressure distribution over the upper and lower surfaces varies with changes in angle of attack, as does the pressure differential and the amount of lift developed. As the angle of attack increases, the low pressure above the aerofoil deepens and the suction peak moves forward. This results in the lift increasing and more of the lift being generated further forward. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, increasing the angle of attack increases CL, which increases Induced drag.",

Upon landing, ground effect can give the effect of floating. The stall speed may be temporarily reduced due to ground effect. Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground. This means that the aircraft needs a lower angle of attack for a certain amount of lift. This results in lower induced drag (decreasing induced angle of attack).",

Ailerons produce adverse yaw, which is where the down-going aileron increases the camber of the wing, and acts similar to a flap, increasing lift, as it is supposed to, but also increasing drag. The up-going aileron reduces the wing camber, reducing drag. This causes an unwanted yaw towards the upward-going wing during a bank. Ailerons can also be affected by the twisting of a wing at high speeds, in an effect known as high speed aileron reversal. Adverse yaw from ailerons can be counteracted in a fe different ways: Roll spoilers. Frise ailerons. Differential ailerons. Roll spoilers are the subject of this question. Spoilers are aerodynamic devices that stick out of the top of a wing, giving a loss of lift similar to an up-going aileron and an increased drag similar to a split flap. They are used on almost all modern commercial jets. When spoilers are used as \"roll spoilers\", they are a primary flight control. They assist or replace the ailerons on the down-going wing by increasing drag and reducing lift. They use this increased drag to even out the drag of the down-going ailerons on the opposite wing, reducing or removing adverse aileron yaw.",

Please do let us know in the comments if you see this question in your exams, and any similarities or differences you remember about it, thank you very much. When flying outside of ground effect, wingtip vortices change the effective airflow around a wing by providing downwash behind the wing. This means that the effective airflow over the wing actually comes from slightly above where the relative airflow is ( This change in angle, where the angle of attack is split into the effective AoA (αe) and the induced AoA (αi) means that the lift from the wing is pointing very slightly rearwards, and that component becomes what we call induced drag. The induced angle of attack (αi) is the angle of attack that is lost due to the effect of wingtip vortices. When entering ground effect, the downwash caused by the wingtip vortices has nowhere to go, as the ground is in the way, so the induced angle of attack is much reduced, and more of the total angle of attack is effective angle, which increases the lift of the wing and reduces the drag significantly. This effect is greatest at the wing tip as that is where the wingtip vortices effect the most.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases.

We have recently made a small wording change that we believe might correspond closer to the exam, and this has changed the \"correct answer\". Beware that this answer is not confirmed, so please send any exam feedback you have to us in the comments, thank you! We can assume that \"the pilot rotates the aircraft at the correct speed and rate\" means that the pilot rotates at the VR that was calculated, and at the correct rate of rotation for a clean airframe. The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will modify the profile of the aerofoil, increase the roughness of the aircraft surface as well as increasing the weight of the aircraft. This reduction in lift and increase in drag drastically affects the flying characteristics of the aircraft. The biggest problem in this scenario is that the disturbance of the airflow causes the wing to stall at a much lower angle of attack, hence the wing has a much lower critical angle of attack, due to the ice accretion. As this is the take-off rotation, the aircraft is very quickly increasing its angle of attack, and the ice accretion could mean that it quickly passes through the angles of attack that produce lift, and past the critical angle of attack. This means that the aircraft is accelerating down the runway with a nose-up attitude, but the wings are stalled so no lift is created. Icing or any other type of contaminant does definitely NOT increase the angle of maximum CL. Any contamination degrades aerodynamic performance, by increasing Drag and decreasing Lift and ultimately by DECREASING the angle for maximum CL. As we mentioned above, this is a terrible question, and this is just one interpretation of it, so be careful whilst reading it if you get it in the exam.",

Flight Spoilers (speed brakes) operate symmetrically about the aircraft’s longitudinal axis to increase drag, when it is required to decelerate quickly or to descend rapidly.

            "explanation": "Camber is the asymmetry between two acting surfaces on an airfoil. For an aircraft, this is the top and the bottom of the wing. Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin (and generates 0 lift at a negative angle of attack). A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. If we add flaps to the clean configuration, CL will increase, but so will the drag. This degrades glide performance. The rate of descent will increase and glide range will decrease.",

            "explanation": "DOWNWASH Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow. It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the exact same thing, but there are subtle differences to how we view it in different contexts as part of the syllabus. Evaluating all possible meanings, the only correct answer is \"stronger wingtip vortices\". INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, some air tries to \"cheat\" the wing and travel around the wingtip, creating wingtip vortices that affect the lift of the rest of the wing. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. These vortices create upwash in front of the wing and downwash behind the wing, effectively changing the local relative airflow, and therefore changing the effective angle of attack of the wing. This produces inefficiencies and means the wing's lift is produced at an angle, and some of the lift turns into drag, called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The stronger the wingtip vortices, the greater the downwash behind the wing. As part of producing a lifting force on the aircraft, a wing must force air to go downwards, to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion (equal and opposite reactions). This is referred to as downwash also, and means that the air flowing away from a wing is pointing slightly downwards, but it arrived at the wing perfectly horizontal, for instance. The amount of \"downwash\" is directly proportional to the lift produced, and therefore: Decreased lift produces less downwash. Increased dynamic pressure means higher airspeed, but has no effect on the magnitude of lift, and therefore downwash, and will actually decrease the angle of the downwash, due to more air flowing over the wing for the same lift force. This is assuming the same lift force, which we see as much more realistic than assuming a constant angle of attack or lift coefficient, etc., for these questions. Entering ground effect reduces the effect of wingtip vortices, making the wing more efficient, due to the reduced downwash (as the air cannot flow down as much due to the ground in the way).",

The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π*AR Where, CDI – Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, decreasing the angle of attack decreases CL, which decreases Induced drag.

Easy to manufacture Slotted flap (and multiple slotted flaps) - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft.",

The lower surface of a wing is normally at a pressure above atmospheric, whilst the upper surface is at a pressure below atmospheric. Beyond the wing tips the air is nominally at atmospheric pressure. This causes a spanwise flow of air outward away from the fuselage on the lower surface and an inward flow toward the fuselage on the upper surface. At the trailing edge of the wing, where the two flows meet, a twisting motion is imparted to the air and a series of vortices form. These are trailing edge vortices. The effect of these vortices is to create more down wash behind the wing than up wash in front of the wing. This results in the effective air flow (EAF) being inclined to the relative air flow (RAF) by an angle called the induced angle of attack (αi). Because of this local increase in induced angle of attack, the overall lift generated by a wing will be below the value that would be generated if there were no spanwise pressure differential. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. Induced drag increases with decreasing speed (for a constant lift force). This is because, as speed decreases, the downwash caused by the tip vortices becomes more significant, the rearward inclination of the lift is bigger, and therefore induced drag is higher.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

Flaps increase the camber (and sometimes the area) of the wing, which increases the amount of lift that can be produced by the wing, for the same IAS (indicated airspeed). They also increase the drag of the wing, by more than they increase lift. This means that the aircraft will always fly more efficiently (better L/D ratio) without flaps, hence why they are not used in the cruise, or the climb, when possible. Flaps are primarily used for take-off and landing. For take-off, we can rotate at a lower speed, using less runway, and maintain a lower flying speed on the initial climb out. For landing, we can approach at a slower speed (with a higher approach angle if necessary, due to the extra drag), and therefore land in a shorter distance. For take-off, using flaps is a trade-off between runway length and climb requirements. Flaps are bad for climbing, as they produce more drag, but they will get us off the runway earlier. Therefore, if there is a long runway and high obstacles around, lower (or no) flaps should be used, whereas a short field take-off with few obstacles should use higher flap settings. If there is a short field with obstacles, run the performance calculations carefully for both, and use whichever is better. In terms of this question, the take-off distance will obviously reduce from no flaps (clean) to some flaps, due to the lower distance to rotation, but will begin to increase again towards full flaps, as the aircraft have so much drag that even if it does leave the ground early, it will struggle to climb to the screen height. Many aircraft would not be able to sustain a climb at all with full flaps set, and the final stage of flaps often produces little extra lift than the last stage, but produces lots more drag.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag INTERFERENCE DRAG The total drag experienced by an aircraft is greater than the sum of the drag caused by individual parts of the aeroplane. This additional drag is caused by flow interference at the junction of the various parts of the aeroplane such as the wing/fuselage and wing/nacelle junctions. Interference drag is caused by the mixing of the boundary layers at the junction of adjoining aerofoil surfaces Adding fairings at the junctions, e.g. trailing-edge wing roots and blended winglets, can reduce its effect.",

The principle of operation of vortex generators is that they create small vortices that cause the faster moving air above the boundary layer to be deflected from the top of the boundary layer to the slower moving air near the aerofoil surface. This transfers momentum and re-energises the lower layer of the boundary air, delaying the separation point to further aft along the aerofoil surface. Vortex generators are also frequently used on a swept wing to delay tip stall and improve the stall characteristics. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. For aeroplanes travelling at high subsonic or transonic speeds, vortex generators weaken the shockwave and decrease shock drag but have no diminishing effect on wing-tip vortices. Nevertheless, the vortices produced by the vortex generators diminish shock buffet and are beneficial to the aeroplane’s overall performance",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases.",

These surfaces individually hinge at their leading edges and are actuated by hydraulic power supplied by dedicated power control units. The main purpose of the surfaces is to disturb the smooth airflow over the top of the wing, thereby reducing the wings lifting capability. When fully extended, they considerably increase aircraft drag. The maximum deflection angles are greater in the ground mode than the flight mode. With the spoilers in their fully extended position, approximately 80% of the wing/flap lift is destroyed and the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft more than doubles. Although Flaps increase Drag, they also increase Lift. From the options given, the only which causes both Lift to decrease and Drag to increase are the Speed Brakes.",

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag FORM DRAG Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates. On aircraft, for example, a fairing is often fitted around a fixed undercarriage leg to reduce form drag to an acceptable level.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, can experience up to a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. When an aircraft enters ground effect, the reduced downwash changes the makeup of the total angle of attack (AoA), by reducing the induced AoA (αi), and therefore increasing the effective AoA (αe). This changes the effective angle of lift, reducing induced drag and increasing lift. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, when entering ground effect, effective angle of attack (αe) increases, due to reduced downwash.",

Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Parasite drag drag exists even if lift is not being created, (just from the airframe moving through the air). Induced drag, as the name suggests, is a drag produced due to lift.",

The wording provided here is merely an approximation of what you might encounter in your official exam. It is possible that the official question has a \"drop-down\" format. Your feedback is highly valued as it helps us ensure that this question aligns closely with the official version. Thank you for your input! Plain flaps (figure 1; description a) simply lowers the trailing edge of the wing, increasing camber. It finds primary application in low-speed aircraft and situations where extremely short takeoff and landing distances are not essential. When slotted flaps (figure 2; description c) are deployed, they create a gap or slot between the flap and the wing. This slot is designed to channel higher-pressure air from the lower surface over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. By doing so, it postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Compared to plain or split flaps, slotted flaps offer a greater increase in CLmax while inducing less drag. Fowler flaps (figure 3; description b) operate by first moving backward and then downward. Initially, they expand the wing area and subsequently enhance its camber. Due to the combined effects of increased area and camber, Fowler flaps provide the most substantial lift augmentation among all flap types. Moreover, they generate minimal drag due to the presence of single or multiple slots and the reduction in thickness-to-chord ratio as the chord length expands. Split flaps (figure 4; description d) are located at the lower surface of the wing's trailing edge, and when lowered, they do not alter the contour of the upper surface. At low angles of attack, they provide a lift increase similar to that of a basic plain flap, but slightly more lift at higher angles. This is because the upper surface's camber remains unchanged, preventing airflow separation. However, the drag is higher than for the plain flap due to the increased depth of the wake.",

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow (primarily due to 3D airflow and wingtip vortices). It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing as part of lift generation. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the same thing, in fact, but there are some differences to how we view them in different contexts as part of the syllabus. The two similar terms do not cause a problem in this question, and the correct answer remains the same. The main wing generates downwash as a by-product of lift generation; the magnitude of downwash is proportional to the lift created. Think of the momentum change in the airflow as being the 'equal and opposite reaction' to the lift force, in order to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion. Therefore, one can say that the greater the downwash, the greater the lift being generated by the aerofoil. If the aerofoil is producing more lift, its angle of attack will be greater, and downwash will be greater, especially towards the wingtip where vortices are stronger. If we observe a lot of downwash, we can conclude that a lot of lift is being generated.",

They do increase drag also. 2 - Kreuger flaps - The underside of the leading edge unfolds, to split the airflow much further down than the usual stagnation point, thereby forcing more air over the upper surface wing, generating higher lift and a faster boundary layer, delaying the stall. There is some drag penalty for using Kreuger flaps. 3 - Slats - The most effective high lift devices; very little increase in drag, but a much delayed stall, so the wing can have a much higher CLMAX. They achieve this by squeezing some high speed air through that slot from beneath to above the wing. The annex here is not perfectly descriptive, but we will assume that the old position is outlined only, and the new position is filled in with colour. This means that item 1 is being extended, whereas items 2 and 3 are being retracted. This means that only item 1 is increasing the CL (and in fact, even extending item 3 (slats) does not actually increase the CL really, it only increases CLMAX by delaying the stall). Note: If you get an annex just like this in the exam, it would be worth commenting or appealing based on the annex, as it is very difficult to work out which whether each is retracting or extending without any indication of what position comes first and what comes last.",

The three leading edge devices shown in the annex are: Leading Edge Flaps - similar to trailing edge flaps, they increase the camber of the wing to increase CL and CLMAX Kreuger Flaps - part of the lower surface of the leading edge, which can be rotated about its forward edge to force more airflow over the top of the wing at high angles of attack. Slats - These are small \"extra leading edges\" that move forward in front of the leading edge of the wing, creating a small slot behind, where airflow is sped up and re-energised, delaying the stalling angle of attack without increasing the CL at normal angles of attack. Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, increase CL values for all angles of attack, also increasing drag, with only a small increase in the critical angle of attack (but that varies depending on the specifics of the wing). They are less common to use on large commercial aircraft than the other leading edge devices, but are used on a few different fighter jets, amongst other aircraft types. Slats do not increase CL for normal values of AoA, instead, they just delay the stalling AoA, allowing for a higher CLMAX due to the higher critical AoA. Note: The feedback for this question has not confirmed the correct answer, and we have had to make a few educated guesses whilst creating the annex from limited feedback. Please let us know if you see this in the exam, and any differences you can remember, as well as if you got it correct/what the correct answer is, thank you!",

CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. LEADING EDGE HIGH LIFT DEVICES There are two forms of leading edge high lift device commonly in use: the leading edge flap and the leading edge slot or slat. VARIABLE CAMBER LEADING EDGE FLAP To improve efficiency by giving a better leading edge profile, the camber of a leading edge flap may be increased as it is deployed. Unlike trailing edge flaps, which can be selected to intermediate positions, leading edge flaps are usually either fully extended (deployed) or retracted (stowed). Leading edge flaps increase the critical angle of attack. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flapsalters the pressure distribution around the wing. Trailing edge flaps decrease the critical angle of attack. LIFT TO DRAG RATIO The L/D ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore, the highest value of the L/D ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up.",

This scenario is effectively asking what happens if we land with less flaps. Well of course, with less flaps, our stall speed will be higher, as flaps increase the camber (and sometimes area) of the wing, allowing an aircraft to fly slower with the same amount of lift. With a higher stall speed, the approach speed VREF will be higher, the aircraft will touch down with more groundspeed, causing a longer landing distance than if a higher flap setting were to be used. So that is (1) and (3) answered, and we must remember that with a lower flap setting we have less lift available for the same IAS, and lower drag. The component that influences our landing distance is the lift, though, as the lack of lift means we have to fly at a higher speed, and land at a higher speed. The extra drag from more flaps would not really reduce our landing distance, as all the braking action during landing comes from the brakes (and reverse thrust, if available), and the flaps actually reduce the weight of the aircraft on the wheels, so reduce braking ability slightly.",

Wings can be made in many different planforms, which all have different properties, ranging from their spanwise lift distributions to their stall characteristics, transonic flight characteristics, ease of construction, etc. Rectangular planforms are the simplest, and this is why small aircraft like Cessna 172s use this planform. They have stable stall characteristics and decent efficiency for small GA and trainer aircraft. Elliptical planforms are the most complex, the most expensive to manufacture, but are mathematically designed to produce the least induced drag. This is because their shape changes the lift distribution to make the root produce more of the lift, and this reduces nicely to zero at the wing tip. This means the air which wishes to go round the wingtip is less prone to doing so, and therefore produces smaller, less impactful wingtip vortices. These smaller wingtip vortices mean that elliptical wings produce less induced drag than other wing planforms. This is part of the reason that they were fitted to some older fighter aeroplanes such as the Supermarine Spitfire, an aircraft that was very reliant on its turning ability, and would therefore experience high induced drag during these manoeuvres. Modern jet aircraft do not use these planforms as they are annoying and expensive to manufacture, and don't have as good high-speed characteristics as swept-tapered wings.",

            "explanation": "Short explanation: During landing, a low wing aircraft experiences a reduced amount of lift reduction compared to a high wing aircraft because of its wing's proximity to the ground. This proximity generates a ground effect, which increases lift and reduces drag, resulting in a more stable and controlled landing. In comparison, during takeoff, a high wing aircraft has the advantage of a clearer view of the runway, while a low wing aircraft may have a portion of its wing blocked by the runway surface, reducing lift. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. Based on the above, we can say that the answer must be one that includes \"Landing\". Ground effect has greater effect on low wing aircrafts than high wing aircrafts due to being closer to the ground.",

The pressure distribution around an aerofoil is the resultant of the angle of the aerofoil chordline to the oncoming airflow, the angle of attack. If a symmetrical aerofoil section is in a steady airstream at zero degrees Angle of Attack, a stagnation point forms on the leading edge. The airflow velocity above and below the aerofoil increases by an equal amount and the static pressures reduce by an equal amount. Consequently, no pressure differential exists, and no net lift is created.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that curve 2 is correct.",

Take a look at the Cirrus SR-22 examples in the attached figure. Notice the difference in wingtip vortex size at altitude, vs. near the ground? When your wing is close to the ground, wingtip vortices can't get as big, because as they spin around your wingtip, they impact the ground and dissipate. The result? A reduction in downwash. Less downwash, less induced drag. This means that ground effect reduces the coefficient of induced drag (CDI), which is a component of the total drag coefficient (CD). Summary: Flying low to the ground limits your vortices and the downwash from the wings, which reduces the induced drag coefficient (CDI), and decreases the total drag accordingly. Ground effect is definitely experienced within half a wingspan of the ground. In this question, the wingspan equals 20 m which equals approximately 60 ft (65 ft to be exact). Nonetheless, the lowest height is the one where the ground effect will be stronger, and therefore 30 ft is where CDI is lowest.",

Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases.

At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag.

This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

The extension of flaps causes a very large increase in the coefficient of lift, as well as a significant increase in drag. If this happens for just one wing, but not the other, it can lead to very difficult handling characteristics for the pilot to try and control. This is called flap asymmetry. The right wing has its flap down, but the left wing does not. That means the lift from the right wing will be higher than the left wing, so a strong roll to the left will occur. This will be accompanied by a yaw to the right, due to the increased drag on the right wing, but with flap asymmetry, the roll is the dominant effect by far.",

The spacing of the streamlines indicates the change of speed; streamlines close together indicate a high airspeed and those further apart a low airspeed. The ‘equation of continuity’ states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed; air mass flow is constant. From Bernoulli’s theorem it can be deduced that an increase of airspeed around an aerofoil results in a decrease of air pressure and vice versa. THE STAGNATION POINT The stagnation point is that point on an aerofoil at which the approaching airflow becomes stationary. It is located on the leading edge of the aerofoil just below the maximum point of curvature and moves downward and aft along the lower surface of the aerofoil profile as the angle of attack increases. AEROFOIL UPPER-SURFACE AIRFLOW The flow over the top of the section accelerates rapidly around the nose and over the leading portion of the surface - inducing a substantial decrease in static pressure in those areas. The rate of acceleration increases with increase in angle of attack, up to about 16°. The pressure reduces continuously from the stagnation value through the free stream value to a position on the top surface where a peak negative value is reached. From there onwards the flow continuously slows down again and the pressure increases back to the free stream value in the region of the trailing edge.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

From there onwards the flow continuously slows down again and the pressure increases back to the free stream value in the region of the trailing edge.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. Returning the flaps to their neutral position when no longer required, returns the wing to its former aerodynamic characteristics. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. USE OF TRAILING EDGE FLAPS FOR TAKE-OFF For take-off purposes, the flaps are normally lowered to a position that provides the best lift-drag ratio that can be obtained with the flaps in any position other than fully up. Since the required lift is obtained at a lower airspeed, the take-off run is also reduced. Larger amounts of flap cause a significant increase in drag, which greatly reduces the acceleration and increases the take-off run. The reduced stalling angle of attack and increased drag associated with flaps also reduces the rate and angle of climb. After take-off, a minimum climb gradient is required in the take-off configuration. Climb gradient is reduced by flap, so if climb gradient is limiting, a lesser flap angle may be selected even though it gives a longer take-off distance.",

LIFT/DRAG RATIO For any given mass and altitude, level flight can be maintained at any speed, between the maximum and minimum limits, by adjusting the angle of attack to keep the lift formula in balance, to ensure the lift developed is equal to the mass. As the angle of attack increases so does the induced drag, this increases the total drag. To counteract the increased total drag a greater amount of thrust is required. This will increase the fuel consumption and is clearly an inefficient way to maintain level flight. The most efficient manner in which to fly an aeroplane is with an angle of attack that creates the greatest amount of lift whilst causing the least amount of drag. The most efficient angle of attack is that which produces the highest lift/drag ratio. This angle of attack is the same for all masses and altitudes and is usually 4º. The EAS at which this occurs is the most economical cruise EAS and varies in direct proportion to the gross mass of the aeroplane. THE EFFECT OF FLAPS Although lift increases with greater flap angles so also does drag, but to a much greater extent, particularly at angles of attack above that which produces the best lift/drag ratio. Lowering flaps usually decreases the lift/drag ratio and, although it is possible to fly at a lower speed, the thrust required increases. Selecting the largest flap angle causes the greatest negative influence on the lift/drag ratio.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Next, knowing that the total pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure, we know that if one increases, the other must decrease to maintain a constant total pressure. Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! Therefore, going back to the question, we can say that the point of minimum static pressure is the point of maximum dynamic pressure (airflow velocity). Therefore the point of minimum static pressure will be somewhere on the top of a positively cambered aerofoil. This would most commonly be at the point of maximum camber, but not always! Changes in angle of attack will move the point of maximum velocity forwards and backwards, therefore the most correct answer is where streamlines are closest together.",

Slotted flap (and multiple slotted flaps) - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. It has a lower CL/CD compared to more advanced designs. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high CL/CD ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft. Here's the order from the lowest to the highest CL/CD ratio: (3) Split flap ⇒ (1) Plain flap ⇒ (2) Slotted flap ⇒ (4) Fowler flap.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag FORM DRAG Form (pressure) drag results from the pressure at the leading edge of a body being greater than the pressure at the trailing edge. Skin friction, along with the adverse pressure gradient behind the transition will cause a reduction in kinetic energy of the boundary layer. Separation will occur when the boundary layer does not have sufficient kinetic energy in the presence of a given adverse pressure gradient. Because of separation, there will be a lower pressure at the trailing edge than the leading edge. An aerodynamic force will act in the direction of the lower pressure - form drag. When a shock wave forms on the upper surface, the increase of static pressure through the shock wave will create an extreme adverse pressure gradient.

Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and when low airspeeds are beneficial. This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. USE OF TRAILING EDGE FLAPS FOR TAKE-OFF For take-off purposes, the flaps are normally lowered to a position that provides the best lift-drag ratio that can be obtained with the flaps in any position other than fully up. Since the required lift is obtained at a lower airspeed, the take-off run is also reduced. Larger amounts of flap cause a significant increase in drag, which greatly reduces the acceleration and increases the take-off run. The reduced stalling angle of attack and increased drag associated with flaps also reduces the rate and angle of climb.",

Span-wise airflow is created because a wing producing lift has a lower static pressure on the upper surface than on the lower surface. At the wing tip, however, there can be no pressure difference, and the pressure is equalized by air flowing around the wing tip from the higher pressure on the lower surface to the lower pressure on the upper surface. There is therefore a span-wise pressure gradient, i.e., pressure changing along the wing span. One of the primary factors which determine the magnitude of the vortices is the angle of attack. For a given speed, the wing lift, and thus the magnitude of the tip vortices, increases with the angle of attack. Slow, heavy, clean\" are the three major conditions generating stronger wing vortices. Extending the flaps increases the coefficient of lift (CL), which means that for a given speed, a lower angle of attack will be required, which reduces the wing tip vortices strength. “Stronger with a high aspect ratio” and “Not related to aspect ratio”. Incorrect. The magnitude of the wingtip vortices is inversely proportional to aspect ratio",

This helps you visualise the scenario, but in reality, even that knowledge is not required. If an aerofoil is not producing any lift, then it is not producing any lift-induced drag, which is a by-product of lift. As it is at subsonic speeds, then no shockwaves have been formed (that would be transonic or supersonic), and therefore no wave drag is produced. The aerofoil is moving through the air, so does produce skin friction drag, form (pressure) drag and interference drag. These are all constituent parts of \"parasite drag\".",

They can extend symmetrically or asymmetrically. If spoilers on both sides are used, its primary purpose is to reduce the speed at which the aircraft is travelling. Spoilers can also be used in a turn to assist the ailerons. In this case, the spoiler mounted on the down-going wing will come up, reducing lift for that wing even more and therefore assisting the ailerons. The spoiler on the up-moving wing will remain stowed. For example, if the aircraft wants to enter a right turn, it will have to bank to the right. The right wing will have to come down and the left wing will have to rise. The aileron on the left will come down, producing more lift on the left wing and the aileron on the right will come up. The spoiler mounted on the upper side of the right wing will also come up, reducing lift of the right wing even more. This way the aircraft reaches its desired bank angle easier at low speeds.",

Learning Objective 081.01.09.01.09: Explain the effects of flap-setting errors, such as mis-selection and premature/late extension or retraction of flaps, on: take-off and landing distance and speeds; climb and descent performance; stall buffet margins. This scenario is effectively asking what happens if we land with less flaps. Well of course, with less flaps, our stall speed will be higher, as flaps increase the camber (and sometimes area) of the wing, allowing an aircraft to fly slower with the same amount of lift. With a higher stall speed, the approach speed VREF will be higher, the aircraft will touch down with more groundspeed, causing a longer landing distance than if a higher flap setting were to be used. So that is (1) and (4) answered, and we must remember that with a lower flap setting we have less lift available for the same IAS. This is the component that influences our landing distance, as the lack of lift means we have to fly at a higher speed, and land at a higher speed. As for the drag, lower flap settings produce less drag. This is not the main factor behind the increased landing distance though, as most of the braking action during landing comes from the brakes (and reverse thrust, if available), and the flaps actually reduce the weight of the aircraft on the wheels, so reduce braking ability slightly.",

Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! What this means for our question is that: Converging streamlines indicate a speed increase Diverging streamlines indicated a speed decrease A decrease in static pressure occurs with an increasing speed And an increase in static pressure occurs with a decreasing speed",

This has nothing to do with induced drag. 2) Propeller slipstream over the wing. – Incorrect The slipstream from a propeller will cause a couple effects, such as yaw, and torque, but it will have no effect on induced drag. 3) Aerodynamic interaction between aeroplane parts. – Incorrect The drag because of aerodynamic interaction between aeroplane parts is known as interfrerence drag, and has nothing to do with induced drag. 4) Downwash generated by tip vortices. – Correct Firstly, one could simply deduce the correct answer through cancelling out the incorrect answer. Secondly, we know that induced drag is a secondary effect of lift. Wing tip vortices are a result of the upwash and downwash effect near the tip of the wings, which produces a rearward component of lift knows as induced drag. Therefore this is the correct answer.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Boundary Layer Skin friction drag is a function of the layer of air closest to the surface. As air flows over a wing, the roughness of the surface and the viscous property of the air itself slow it down. Much like fluids, the more viscous the air, the greater its retardation. At the surface, the air particles adhere to it and their relative velocity is reduced to zero (figure 1). Just above the surface, the air particles slow down due to the friction effects between the particles, but except for the layer in contact with the surface, the particles do not completely come to rest. The relative velocity of the air particles increases steadily with distance from the surface, until reaching a point where the particles do not slow up at all and instead travel at the free stream velocity. The boundary layer is the layer of air between the surface and the free stream velocity in which local retardation takes place. Like the main airflow, the boundary layer flow can be either laminar or turbulent in nature (figure 2). Skin Friction Drag Skin friction is the reaction to the retardation of the airflow within the boundary layer. The retarded air tries to drag the surface along with the flow, in much the same way as two solid surfaces sliding over each other do. Known as shear stress, this is directly proportional to the speed of flow. Figure 3 represents the shear stress patterns that exist between layers. The gradual velocity change associated with the laminar boundary layer shows that low shear stresses exist near the surface, resulting in low skin friction drag. Conversely, the rapid velocity change associated with the turbulent boundary layer is evidence of high skin friction drag.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. The high wing aircraft will still experience ground effect, but because the wing is several feet farther from the runway, the total effect on the aircraft is greatly reduced, as ground effect decreases exponentially with difference from the runway surface. Thus, a high wing on take-off is the configuration with the least reduction in lift.",

Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

This effectively increases the camber of the wing, the angle of attack and the coefficient of lift. However, the thrust may have to be increased to overcome the increased drag, even though when deployed they decrease the magnitude of the wing-tip vortices. Not only does the extension of trailing-edge flaps decrease the critical angle of attack it also increases the CLMAX, increases the total lift generated, increases the total drag, unfavorably affects the lift/drag ratio and decreases the stalling speed no matter what the altitude or mass of the airplane. Unlike slats, trailing-edge flaps increase lift at all angles of attack up to the stall. Thus, if the angle of attack remains constant during flap extension the airplane will begin to climb. All trailing-edge flaps when lowered, increase the acceleration of the airflow over the upper surface of the wing, which reduces the pressure above the wing and increases the upwash over the leading edge. Together these influences generate an increased nose-down pitching moment because of the altered pressure distribution around the flaps and the aft movement of the wing CP.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example: when it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warming that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

However this question does not specify that the velocity remains constant. Now let’s create a situation that follows all the specified parameters of the question. Let’s say we have a tube with steady low subsonic flow. Halfway through this pipe we have a heating element that heats up the air, this will decrease the density of the airflow. So that means we have less mass flow right? Well no because mass flow will naturally always keep itself constant, therefore if the density of the air decreases without any change in cross section area, the velocity will increase. This is because the mass flow on the entry side of the tube will always be the same as the mass flow on the exit side of the tube, even if the air is warmer/colder. Therefore, assuming no constant velocity is specified, any change in temperature will not affect the flow rate.",

Starting from the thickest aerofoil, B has a large amount of positive camber and high thickness with a flat base, looking a little bit like the aerofoil on a STOL aircraft (short take-off and landing). This leads us to believe that it has the highest CLMAX and therefore is line 3. Also, the fact that it produces a positive amount of lift at 0 degrees AoA fits with that aerofoil best. To the other end of the spectrum, aerofoil C is very thin, still with a mostly flat base, and very little camber, so little that it is almost symmetrical. It therefore fits line 1 best on the graph, producing the least amount of lift overall. It looks more like a high speed aerofoil (but the stall characteristics appear very favourable on the graph which looks a little unrealistic for such a thin leading edge). Therefore, aerofoil A which lies directly between B and C in terms of shape and size will also lie in between them on the CL vs AoA graph, so is equivalent to line 2.

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Learning Objective 081.01.10.01.02: Describe the effect of spoilers on the CL-alpha graph and stall speed. Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). In this case though, the graph given in the question removes all uncertainty, and an increase in critical AoA is the only possible correct answer. Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here.",

CL can be altered in flight, for example, by lowering the flaps. When a flap is deflected downwards, the camber of the airfoil increases, the coefficient of lift (CL) increases, resulting in higher lift production.

In simple terms, when the flaps are deployed, CL increases (CL higher than 0.28), but to keep the lift balanced and the altitude constant, the aircraft slows down (V decreases). As a result, even with the increased CL from the flaps, the overall lift remains the same.",

Each flap setting has a VFE speed, which is the maximum flaps extended speed. Above this speed, the flaps will take too much load, and could be damaged. Modern jet transport aircraft often have a flap load relief system, which detects flap overspeed, and can disengage the flap lock, allowing the airflow to push the flaps to a lower setting, or some intermediate value, so that the flaps do not get damaged. Some systems use hydraulic pressure and physically move the flaps using the standard system, whereas others use the \"blowback\" system mentioned above.",

Therefore 850/1013 x ρ = 0.84 ρ is approximate density at 6000 ft. As a result, drag will be 84% of the drag at MSL: 785 N x 0.84 = 659 N (Closest option available is 656 N)",

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: The parasite drag from the extended flap results in a degraded climb angle and climb gradient. In this case, for a take-off using 15º of flaps compared to a clean take-off (flaps retracted), the take-off speeds will be reduced, which results in a reduced take-off run. For fully retracted flaps, the take-off speeds will increase, meaning that the aircraft may remain on the ground after rotation.",

In most cases, speedbrakes are panels (most frequently on the upper surface of the wing, but sometimes mounted on the fuselage top side or left/right side near the tail) which, when selected by the pilot, extend into the airstream to produce drag. Their operating principle is simple. Cross-sectional area increases, the air becomes turbulent in the space directly behind them, which increases parasite drag. The wing-mounted versions of speedbrakes also dump some lift and thereby increase induced drag also as the wing has to fly at a higher angle of attack (though not all speed brakes are of this type, so it is not the correct answer). Since drag increases and lift reduces, lift to drag ratio reduces significantly.",

This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Thus, a low wing aircraft on landing will produce the least amount of Induced Drag.

The equation of continuity can now be simplified to: A x V = Constant ⇒ V ≈ 1/A Because the mass flow must remain constant, it can be seen from the equation of continuity that the reduction in the tube’s cross-sectional area results in an increase in velocity, and vice versa.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50% The increase in stall speed due to ice formation is not easy to quantify, as the accumulation and shape of the iceformation is impossible to predict. Ice or frost must never be allowed to remain on any aerodynamic surfaces in flight, nor must ice, frost, snow or other contamination be allowed to remain on the aircraft immediately before flight.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. The shape of an airfoil has a huge impact on the induced drag of an aircraft assuming the same weight and speed. This question is asking for the effect of: Lift distribution: An elliptical lift distribution generates less induced drag than a rectangular lift distribution. This is because the lift distribution of a rectangular wing creates a larger force near the tip. Even though the elliptical wing creates a larger coefficient of lift at the tip, the subsequently smaller wing area near the tip means that barely any force of lift is created there any therefore leads to a smaller vortex and less induced drag. Therefore statement 1 is correct! Aspect ratio: Induced drag is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio. Therefore, induced drag increases with decreasing aspect ratio, and, induced drag decreases with increasing aspect ratio. Therefore statement 2 is incorrect!",

            "explanation": "GROUND EFFECT Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON TAKE-OFF The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. During the take-off phase of flight, as the aircraft leaves ground effect the wing tip vortices rapidly grow in magnitude producing an increase in downwash behind the wing. This causes a reduction in the lift produced at a given angle of attack and the associated rapid increase in induced drag may prevent a successful take-off. The increased downwash acting on the tailplane increases the download, resulting in a nose-up pitching moment. Downwash angle: Increasing the effect of the vortices will increase downwash angle. Induced angle of attack: The increase in downwash will cause the induced angle of attack to increase leading to a increase in induced drag.",

The pressure distribution around an aerofoil is the resultant of the angle of the aerofoil chordline to the oncoming airflow, the angle of attack. If a symmetrical aerofoil section is in a steady airstream at zero degrees Angle of Attack, a stagnation point forms on the leading edge. The airflow velocity above and below the aerofoil increases by an equal amount and the static pressures reduce by an equal amount. Consequently, no pressure differential exists, and no net lift is created. CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and when low airspeeds are beneficial. This permits operation at greater weights from given runway lengths and enables greater payloads to be carried. Returning the flaps to their neutral position when no longer required, returns the wing to its former aerodynamic characteristics. The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edgeflaps alters the pressure distribution around the wing. LEADING EDGE DEVICES Leading edge devices increase maximum value of CL and critical angle of attack. But for the constant angle of attack CL is the same or less.

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag (and induced drag coefficient) decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. The induced angle of attack increases.",

The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. INDUCED DRAG vs. AIRSPEED The Effect of Airspeed relates to the changes in induced drag with the variation of airspeed. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds and high angles of attack (i.e. during take-off and landing, when it can account for approximately three-quarters of the total drag). To maintain steady level flight, as the airspeed decreases and the angle of attack increases, the slower passage of air rearward over the wing increases the spanwise flow of air around the wing tip. This results in larger wing tip vortices and greater induced drag.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum DragSpeed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. PARASITE DRAG If an aircraft were flying at zero lift angle of attack, the only drag present would be parasite drag. FORM DRAG Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. EFFECT OF CONFIGURATION ON TOTAL DRAG Extension of the landing gear, air brakes, or flaps will increase parasite drag but will not substantially affect induced drag. The effect of increasing parasite drag is to increase total drag at any IAS but to decrease the speed VMD compared to the clean aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Note: There are quite a few factors which affect an aircraft's landing performance and handling. The question and available options do not take into account these different factors. That is to say that the examiner has been very closed minded in writing this question, using a \"tunnel vision\" approach. The current correct option is simply the only answer that makes any sense. It is the \"most correct\" out of a bad bunch, and in itself is arguable, but depending on the circumstances we have not been told, may be true, whereas the other answers are not true in any circumstance. For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the wing’s effective camber and the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase, therefore Reducing the length of the landing roll. Therefore, the answer here is that using less flaps than expected will cause significantly less drag than expected, so the aircraft may float for a while longer, and therefore have a longer landing roll (that is assuming that the pilot rotates enough during the flare, which has not been specified in the question). As mentioned above, none of the other answers could be correct: There will be a large difference to the handling characteristics, even if the attitude remains the same. There is arguably a higher risk of a hard landing due to the lower \"cushioning\" effect of the lower flap setting. This one takes longer to explain but most pilots know it naturally from experience. A go-around is very much advised if you realise the flaps are incorrectly set at a low altitude where this cannot be fixed.",

The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. When upwash and downwash are reduced, causes the effective angle of attack of the wing to increase: - Downwash angle: Decreasing the effect of the vortices will decrease the downwash angle. - Induced angle of attack: The decrease in upwash/downwash will cause the induced angle of attack to decrease leading to a decrease in induced drag.

This is useful mostly to allow the aircraft to take-off and land in shorter distances, as it can allow the aircraft to fly slower. Secondarily, they are useful for increasing drag, but that is not the purpose of this question. Extending trailing edge flaps allows for a higher camber of wing, and improves the lift coefficient of the wing, so it can produce enough lift at lower speeds than a clean wing, hence the lower stall speeds. As for the centre of pressure, this is the location where all the combined aerodynamic pressure effects act through, and this is based heavily off the pressure distribution around the main wing. The flaps change the pressure distribution a lot, and this causes the overall centre of pressure to move aft when flaps are extended.",

            "explanation": "Wing tip vortices increase if we increase induced drag. This can be caused by for example increased speed, density or lift coefficient. If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. A wing with a higher aspect ratio has a lower value for CLMAX and will have a higher value of CL for a certain angle of attack.",

            "explanation": "When density altitude increases, the air gets \"thinner\", meaning that there are less air particles per cubic metre, and therefore less air particles will hit our aircraft and flow over its wings per mile flown. This would decrease lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but climb higher in the atmosphere, the lower air density means that we have to fly faster to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is an increase in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with increased altitude (ignoring compressibility at very high altitudes). As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with an increase in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the right, due to the increased TAS for the same IAS at higher altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 3, moving to the right.",

Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: • Producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed (due to the slower stall speed). • Producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. • Reducing the length of the landing roll. In this case, for a clean configuration (in comparasion to a full flap configuration): - Drag is reduced; - Speed at threshold is greater; and - Landing distance is increased.",

Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! Going back to the question, we can say that the point of minimum static pressure is the point of maximum dynamic pressure (airflow velocity). Therefore the point of minimum static pressure will be somewhere on the top of a positively cambered aerofoil.",

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. It is important to note that in level flight, the lift force equals weight, and therefore lift does not change just by extending flaps. All that will change is how slow we can fly and still gain that same lift force (stall speed). We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), so increase the drag force.",

            "explanation": "Terminology definition angle of attack: angle between the chord line and the relative (undisturbed) air flow. Local airflow = downwash at the trailing edge of the airfoil for example. Angle of attack (AOA, α - Greek letter alpha) is a term used in aerodynamics to describe the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion between the airfoil and the air through which it is moving. For a two-dimensional airfoil, angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the direction of arrival of the incoming air. In aviation, angle of attack is used to describe the angle between the chord line of the (three dimensional) wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. The angle of attack is often confused with the pitch angle of an aircraft and the angle of incidence. Pitch angle and angle of incidence are measured from the same reference line as angle of attack (conceptually the chord line), but pitch refers to the horizon and angle of incidence to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. Whereas, the angle of attack is measured from the (same) reference line to the direction of the arrival of the air to the wing (caused by the relative motion between the wing and the atmosphere). Note: Some tricky questions ask about the angle of attack of the aeroplane (not the wing) => angle between speed vector and longitudinal axis.",

            "explanation": "Note: This appears to be a scenario based version of an older question, number 818975. When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan, the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, can experience up to a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in downforce on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determines the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any give angle of attack. Any devices that reduce induced drag will cause ground effect to be less effective, as the induced drag is already lowered. Winglets (or fitting bigger winglets) on an aircraft reduce the size and strength of wingtip vortices, and therefore reduce the induced drag in all stages of flight. Therefore, aircraft A with bigger winglets will not feel as much of a reduction in induced drag during ground effect, therefore the ground effect will be decreased on aircraft A. To put it simply, winglets and ground effect do the same job, and ground effect cannot do as much when (bigger) winglets are already fitted.",

            "explanation": "Induced drag is created as a byproduct of lift. The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Angle of attack: The induced drag is proportional to the angle of attack. Therefore, induced drag increases as the angle of attack increases, and, induced drag decreases and the angle of attack decreases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. This is achieve by increasing the angle of attack. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "Wing tip vortices increase if we increase induced drag. This can be caused by for example increased speed, density or lift coefficient. If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional. A wing with a higher aspect ratio has a lower value for CLMAX and will have a higher value of CL for a certain angle of attack.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but EASA have published questions like this one where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). In this case though, the graph given in the question removes all uncertainty, and the only answer is that the graph follows the “B” direction, down and to the right. Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here.",

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 is a significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0º AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber.

Speed stability simply means a disturbance to the sped will return back to the equilibrium, whilst speed instability is the opposite. As the aircraft is situated in the speed unstable region, a sudden decrease in speed will cause the total drag to increase, whilst the thrust remains the same. A thrust deficit will be created.

            "explanation": "Note: This question appears to have different answers with different authorities. We think that the question has no correct answer in its current form. Please send us any exam feedback you have about this question so we can get it as representative as possible of the question in the exam quickly, thank you! As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct. Authority Reported Answer Latvia C (maintained its direction.) Poland Not C Austro Not C Spain A (greater than 10°.) Portugal A (greater than 10°.) We would say if your country is \"Not C\", go for A \"greater than 10 degrees\". A wing creates a force from the air flowing over it, and the direction and magnitude of that \"resultant force\" change based on the speed of the airflow, density of the air, and angle of attack (AoA) of the wing. This resultant force is split into two forces we know very well. Lift and Drag. Lift is the component of the resultant force that acts at 90º to the relative airflow (dictated by the speed and direction of the air approaching the wing - not yet affected by the presence of the wing or the aircraft), whereas drag is the force parallel to the relative airflow. This is the basics of \"2D airflow\", but gets a bit more complicated when we include \"3D airflow\", the existence of induced drag, wingtip vortices, etc. When flying at higher angles of attack, the effects of wingtip vortices introduce upwash ahead of the wing and downwash behind it, and this changes the \"effective\" angle of attack, which is the angle of air as it hits the wing, and is approaching from higher up than the relative airflow. The \"effective lift vector\" is at 90º to this \"effective\" angle of attack. Because this \"effective\" lift vector points slightly backwards, some of this \"effective lift\" is turned into drag. We call that \"induced drag\". The angle of \"tilt\" of the effective lift vector is the same angle that our angle of attack changes by (from actual AoA to effective AoA), and this angle of attack that we \"lose\" is called the induced angle of attack. This is particularly useful knowledge for questions about ground effect. Now to look at this question. When the aircraft slows down and increases its angle of attack to remain straight and level, the actual lift vector (90º to the relative airflow - so directly upwards) must stay the same direction and magnitude, to counteract the weight of the aircraft. The increase in AoA causes an increase in the strength of the wingtip vortices, and therefore the upwash ahead of the wing, thus increasing the induced AoA (the angle of attack that is lost). This means that the \"effective lift vector\" of the wings tilts back somewhat and increases in magnitude (to keep the actual lift constant), creating more induced drag. This \"angle of tilt\" (the induced AoA) is much less than the change in total AoA of 10º. Using normal wings, it would be in the region of 3º change. Therefore, the \"effective lift vector\" would tilt back by around 3º (less than 10º) and increase in magnitude, due to the larger induced AoA. Now that actually doesn't leave us with a correct answer. That is because none of the answers are correct. Even with a question that can be interpreted 2 ways, there is still no correct answer. If you take the question as literally as possible, then the actual lift vector (vertical) does not change in direction or magnitude, remaining vertical and equal to the weight force (option D is therefore wrong due to the magnitude). If you take the question to mean the \"effective lift vector\", then the correct answer would be \"changed direction by a value smaller than 10°, with the lift vector pointing more rearwards because of a larger induced AOA.\". None of the other answers fit this. Answer C says that it stays in the same direction with relation to the chord line, meaning that the effective lift vector moves by 10°, the same as the AoA change, which is not correct.",

            "explanation": "Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: Parasite Drag - independent of lift generation, and Induced Drag - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG is simply caused by the aircraft's shape, construction-type, and material. For instance, an airplane with a rough surface creates more parasite drag than one with a smooth surface. And there are three basic types of parasite drag: 1. Skin Friction Drag is the result of the aircraft's surface being rough. Olympic swimmers wear swim caps on their heads, so hair doesn't create extra drag and they can swim faster through the water => this same principle can be applied to most aircraft, where a smooth skin reduces skin friction drag, improving performance and fuel efficiency. 2. Form Drag is the result of an object's general shape in relation to the relative wind. Resulting from the pressure at the leading edge of a body being greater than the pressure at the trailing edge. 3. Interference Drag is generated by the mixing of airflow streamlines between airframe components such as the wing and the fuselage or the landing gear strut and the fuselage. As air flows around different aircraft components and mixes, a localized shock wave is formed, creating a drag sum greater than the drag that components would have by themselves. Factors Affecting Parasite Drag: Indicated Airspeed - It varies directly with the square of the Indicated Airspeed. If IAS is doubled, the Parasite Drag will be four times greater - if IAS is halved, the Parasite Drag will be one quarter of its previous value. Configuration - Parasite Drag varies directly in proportion to the frontal area presented to the airflow. If flaps are deployed, the undercarriage lowered, speed brakes selected or roll control spoilers operated, \"Parasite Area\" is increased and Parasite Drag will increase. Airframe Contamination - Contamination by ice, frost, snow, mud, dust or slush will increase the Parasite Drag Coefficient, and in the case of severe airframe icing, the Parasite Area.",

Increasing the angle of attack causes the stagnation point to shift downward, leading to more air moving upward over the upper side of the wing and advancing the location of the lowest static pressure point. Consequently, at a specific angle of attack, this airflow triggers the stall warning, emitting an audible alert in the cockpit. The lowest pressure point resides along the upper surface of the wing and shifts in tandem with the Center of Pressure (CP) in response to changes in the Angle of Attack (AoA): an increase in AoA moves the CP forward, while a decrease moves it aft.",

So an aircraft with a Lift to Drag ratio of 10/1 is producing 10 times more lift than it is producing drag. The lift to drag ratio depends on the angle of attack. The angle of attack of a clean wing decides its lift coefficient, and its drag coefficient, then you can compare those two to get the lift/drag ratio. In reality, the lift is often much higher than the drag, so the L/D ratio is usually over 1. If an aircraft could fly fast enough to run at a very low (or negative) angle of attack, then its lift produced (which will equal its weight in straight and level flight) could be less than the drag (and therefore thrust - if the aircraft is at a constant speed). It is a bit of a crazy notion for civilian pilots, as the aircraft would have to have a higher thrust than its own weight, but this is quite common in fighter jets, especially modern jets or VTOL jets. We can see that by the fact that they can accelerate vertically upwards.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

(1) Plain Flap: The rear portion of the wing aerofoil rotates downwards on a simple hinge arrangement mounted at the front of the flap. Provides good increase in CLMAX, but with fairly high drag. (2) Slotted Flap: Similar to a Plain Flap but incorporates a gap between the flap and the wing to force high pressure air from below the wing over the upper surface of the flap. This helps reduce boundary layer separation and allows the airflow over the flap to remain laminar. The slotted flap gives a bigger increase in CLMAX than the plain or split flap and much less drag. (3) Fowler Flap: A split flap that slides rearwards level for a distance prior to hinging downwards. It thereby first increases chord (and wing surface area) and then increases camber. The Fowler flap gives the greatest increase in lift of the flaps considered and also gives the least drag because of the slot and the reduction of thickness",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Ice will lead to sooner separation, smaller stalling angle of attack, therefore causing a lower CLMAX. Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions. The ice changes the airfoil cross section and destroys lift, increases drag and raises the stalling speed.",

Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, increase CL values for all angles of attack, also increasing drag, and not changing the stalling angle of attack very much (small increases or decreases are possible depending on the specifics). Slats do not increase CL for normal values of AoA, instead, they just delay the stalling AoA, allowing for a higher CLMAX due to the higher critical AoA. This is what is being shown in the graph. Kreuger flaps tend to sit somewhere in the middle of the two other devices on the graph, but are obviously very ineffective at low angles of attack.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

On many flap control systems, the deflection on the two sides is compared while the flaps are moving, and if one side should fail, movement on the other side is automatically stopped.

The difference in lift will cause a rolling moment which must be opposed by the ailerons, and the difference in drag will cause a yawing moment which must be opposed by the rudder.

When your wing is close to the ground, wingtip vortices can't get as big, because as they spin around your wingtip, they impact the ground and dissipate. The result? A reduction in downwash. Less downwash, less drag. Summary: Flying low to the ground limits your vortices, making them smaller. This means that the air flowing off the back of your wing has less downwash. Ground effect is definitely experienced within half a wingspan. In this question, the wingspan equals 20 m which equals approximately 60 ft (65 ft to be exact).",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices.

The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. As seen in figure 2, when entering ground effect, for the same angle of attack, lift is increased. Thus, to maintain the same CL as when before entering ground effect, the angle of attack should be decreased in order to decrease CL.",

            "explanation": "High-lift devices are incredibly important for the operation of aircraft. Particularly for large commercial jet aircraft, the use of flaps and slats is essential to allow acceptable take-off distances and land with reasonable speeds. They are incredibly powerful, which causes a massive problem if the flaps operate differently from each other, which we call flap/slat asymmetry. This is possible for many reasons, but a common one is if a flap extension/retraction system jams, the two flap settings will become different from each other. Flap asymmetry is worse than slat asymmetry. Flaps provide a large increase in coefficient of lift and in drag for the same angle of attack as a clean wing, whereas slats increase drag slightly, but delay the stall greatly, allowing the aircraft to fly at a much higher angle of attack. Therefore, a flap asymmetry will cause a large rolling moment away from the extend flaps. and a strong yaw towards the side of the extended flaps. Therefore, to counteract this as pilots, we must roll towards the extended side, and yaw away from the extended side. On this flap indicator, our right-hand flaps are at flap 15 extension, so must have jammed, and our left-hand flaps are retracting through flap 5/flap 2. We must therefore roll to the right and yaw to the left to maintain straight and level flight. This is a flap display off the Boeing 737 and actually indicates the location of flaps and slats, if you know the order of flap extension/retraction, but the examiner wants to keep things simple by saying it is only trailing-edge flaps.",

This dragging effect decreases with increasing depth of the layer of air until at a particular depth the movement of the aeroplane does not affect the air at all. The depth of the layer of air from the aeroplane surface to the depth at which the air is unaffected is the boundary layer. The value of surface-friction drag varies and is determined by: - the total surface area of the aeroplane; - the coefficient of the air viscosity; - the rate of change of flow speed over the depth of the boundary layer. FLOW TRANSITION The nearer the transition point is to the leading edge of an aerofoil the greater is the amount of surface friction. The location of the transition point from laminar flow to turbulent flow is dependent on four factors: - surface condition; - speed of flow; - size of the object; - adverse pressure gradient. SURFACE CONDITION The depth of the boundary layer, both laminar and turbulent, increase with distance from the leading edge of an aerofoil. A rough, dirty, wet, or ice-covered surface will increase the depth of this layer causing greater interference with the airflow over the aerofoil. Polishing the aerofoil surface minimises the effect of this type of drag.",

Tapered wings are structurally very strong, as the wing root is a lot bigger, allowing for a stronger connection to the fuselage, and the wing gradually gets thinner towards the wingtip where less reinforcement is required. There are some aerodynamic benefits to tapered wings as well, which includes a small reduction in induced drag, due to the majority of the lift coming from the wing closer to the root. One of the problems with a tapered wing is the stall handling. On a rectangular wing, the stall begins at the back near the root, whereas on a tapered wing, the stall will begin near the tip instead, which leads to the aileron area becoming stalled, and losing aileron (roll) control (see first annex above). The taper of a wing is measured by the taper ratio, which is simply Taper ratio = tip chord / root chord So if the taper ratio is 0.5, the wingtip is half as wide as the root. Any number less than 1 indicates that the wing is tapered. 1 means the chord stays the same along the whole wingspan, more than 1 would be a wing that gets wider.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50% The increase in stall speed due to ice formation is not easy to quantify, as the accumulation and shape of the ice formation is impossible to predict. Ice or frost must never be allowed to remain on any aerodynamic surfaces in flight, nor must ice, frost, snow or other contamination be allowed to remain on the aircraft immediately before flight.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. Another characteristic associated with ground effect is the change in aircraft trim and stability. This occurs because the surface deflects the downwash acting behind the wing, thus altering the angle at which the airflow meets the tail plane This places the tail plane at a less negative, or increased angle of attack, and reduces the download acting on the tail plane. In this condition, the aircraft experiences a nose-down pitching moment (figure 2). A high T tailed aircraft do not respond in this manner since the tail plane is outside the influence of the downwash.",

Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct!

            "explanation": "Terminology definition angle of attack: angle between the chord line and the relative (undisturbed) air flow.

Angle of attack (AOA, α - Greek letter alpha) is a term used in aerodynamics to describe the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion between the airfoil and the air through which it is moving. For a two-dimensional airfoil, angle of attack is the angle between the chord line and the direction of arrival of the incoming air. In aviation, angle of attack is used to describe the angle between the chord line of the (three dimensional) wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line. The angle of attack is often confused with the pitch angle of an aircraft and the angle of incidence. Pitch angle and angle of incidence are measured from the same reference line as angle of attack (conceptually the chord line), but pitch refers to the horizon and angle of incidence to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. Whereas, the angle of attack is measured from the (same) reference line to the direction of the arrival of the air to the wing (caused by the relative motion between the wing and the atmosphere). Note: Some tricky questions ask about the angle of attack of the aeroplane (not the wing) => angle between speed vector and longitudinal axis.",

It is created by the vortices at the tip of an aircraft's wing. The magnitude of induced drag depends on the amount of lift being generated by the wing and on the shape and size of the wing. Induced drag can be reduced by: Using a high aspect ratio wing planform => Wings with high aspect ratio have lower induced drag than wings with low aspect ratio for the same wing area. So wings with a long span and a short chord have lower induced drag than wings with a short span and a long chord. Using a tapered wing planform with wing twist and/or spanwise camber variation, or incorporation of wing end plates, tip tanks, winglets or various wing tip shapes. Note: Winglets are small vertical aerofoils which form part of the wing tip; they reduce tip vortex intensity, thus reduce induced drag - this is their only function.",

This effect becomes noticeable when the aircraft's height above the surface is equal to or less than its wingspan. The closer the wing is to the surface, the stronger the ground effect. As a result, low-wing and low-tail aircraft experience a much more pronounced ground effect compared to high-wing designs.

These effects combine to delay the forward movement of the separation point as angle of attack increases. The stall is delayed until a higher angle of attack is reached.

As speed increases above MCRIT shock waves begin to form and drag increases more rapidly than it would have done without the shock waves. The additional drag is called wave drag and is due to energy drag and boundary layer separation. Heat is created at a shock wave. Energy has to be used to provide this temperature rise across the shock wave and this energy loss is drag on the aircraft – Energy Drag. The high pressure found at the shock wave creates a strong adverse pressure gradient on the aircraft surface. This turbulence represents energy lost to the flow and contributes to the drag – Separation Drag.",
