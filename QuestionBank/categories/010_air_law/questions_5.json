In this case, the aircraft has taken up an offset, but the track has turned away from them, and now they are clear of weather they need to somehow return to the original track. You are often told by ATC (who have the flight plan) what waypoint to rejoin the track at, but if they do not mention this and just say \"resume own navigation\", then you can assume that you are to rejoin the track at the next coming waypoint. This is the most intuitive thing to do anyway.

By position reports which positively indicate the aircraft are over different geographic locations as determined visually or by reference to a navigation aid ( 5.4.1.2.1.2 By use of NDB, VOR or GNSS on intersecting tracks or ATS routes. By requiring aircraft to fly on specified tracks which are separated by a minimum amount appropriate to the navigation aid employed. Lateral separation between two aircraft exists when: a) VOR: both aircraft are established on radials diverging by at least 15 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; b) NDB: both aircraft are established on tracks to or from the NDB which are diverging by at least 30 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; c) GNSS/GNSS: each aircraft is confirmed to be established on a track with zero offset between two waypoints and at least one aircraft is at a minimum distance from a common point as specified in Table 5-1; or d) VOR/GNSS: the aircraft using VOR is established on a radial to or from the VOR and the other aircraft using GNSS is confirmed to be established on a track with zero offset between two waypoints and at least one aircraft is at a minimum distance from a common point as specified in Table 5-1. Lateral separation between aircraft can be provided either by using different geographic locations, or by the use of the same navigation aid. When using the same navigation aid, depending on the aid the separation minima differ (i.e. VOR separation minima 15 degrees at 15 NM, NDB separation minima 30 degrees at 15 NM).

Any further exam feedback, as always, is very useful! When aircraft are navigating via the same navigational aid and also require lateral separation from each other, they are required to fly certain tracks (often diverging by no less than a particular angle) as well as a distance away from a common nav-aid (to make sure they are not too close together. For VORs, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 15° and one aircraft must be at least 15 NM away from the VOR, to provide adequate separation. For NDBs, which are less accurate, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 30° and one aircraft must be at least 15 NM away from the NDB, to provide adequate separation. This does mean that there is no set separation for all nav-aids (and when GNSS is used it is different again), so we must answer that it is \"according to the navigational aid in use\". Again, this may not be the exact wording in the exam.",

Only after this check has been made shall the discrete code be used as a basis for identification. 8.6.2.4 PSR IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES 8.6.2.4.1 Where PSR is used for identification, aircraft may be identified by one or more of the following procedures: a) by correlating a particular radar position indication with an aircraft reporting its position over, or as bearing and distance from, a point shown on the situation display, and by ascertaining that the track of the particular radar position is consistent with the aircraft path or reported heading; b) by correlating an observed radar position indication with an aircraft which is known to have just departed, provided that the identification is established within 2 km (1 NM) from the end of the runway used. Particular care should be taken to avoid confusion with aircraft holding over or overflying the aerodrome, or with aircraft departing from or making a missed approach over adjacent runways; c) by transfer of identification (see 8.6.3); d) by ascertaining the aircraft heading, if circumstances require, and following a period of track observation: — instructing the pilot to execute one or more changes of heading of 30 degrees or more and correlating the movements of one particular radar position indication with the aircraft’s acknowledged execution of the instructions given; or — correlating the movements of a particular radar position indication with manoeuvres currently executed by an aircraft having so reported. When using these methods, the controller shall: i) verify that the movements of not more than one radar position indication correspond with those of the aircraft; and ii) ensure that the manoeuvre(s) will not carry the aircraft outside the coverage of the radar or the situation display. 8.6.2.4.2 Use may be made of direction-finding bearings to assist in identification of an aircraft. This method, however, shall not be used as the sole means of establishing identification, unless so prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority for particular cases under specified conditions. From the above document, we can see that both Primary (PSR) and Secondary (SSR) surveillance radar can be used to identify an aircraft on the radar screen. For SSR, squawking a specific code/ident are both good ways of identifying an aircraft, but using PSR only, the controller may have to ask the pilot to do a series of specific turns and track their position to positively identify the aircraft. In both these cases, an aircraft would not be asked to set an emergency squawk code (unless actually in an emergency situation of course), and whilst climbing and descending could provide a little identification in SSR, it is not an approved method.",

Note.— Separate or multiple runways may be designated runway-in-use for arriving aircraft and departing aircraft. 7.2.2 Normally, an aircraft will land and take off into wind unless safety, the runway configuration, meteorological conditions and available instrument approach procedures or air traffic conditions determine that a different direction is preferable. In selecting the runway-in-use, however, the unit providing aerodrome control service shall take into consideration, besides surface wind speed and direction, other relevant factors such as the aerodrome traffic circuits, the length of runways, and the approach and landing aids available.",

This is easy to remember, as there is an easy and logical pattern to the radar separation, starting at 6 NM for the worst scenario (LIGHT following HEAVY), reducing by 1 NM for each larger aircraft category also following HEAVY; 5 NM for MEDIUM following HEAVY, and 4 NM for HEAVY following HEAVY. The other scenario that needs to be covered is LIGHT following MEDIUM, which is easy to remember, as it is just 1NM knocked off the LIGHT following HEAVY separation above, so 6 NM - 1 NM = 5 NM. Given the easy layout of the table, it is usually either best to memorise some of these numbers and the pattern they fall in, or just memorise the whole table. \"SUPER\" heavy aircraft are not covered in this table.",

This may be accomplished by voice communications, ATIS broadcast or data link. 4.10.4.4 The transition level shall be included in approach clearances when so prescribed by the appropriate authority or requested by the pilot. 4.10.4.5 A QNH altimeter setting shall be included in the descent clearance when first cleared to an altitude below the transition level, in approach clearances or clearances to enter the traffic circuit, and in taxi clearances for departing aircraft, except when it is known that the aircraft has already received the information. The transition level is the top of the transition layer, where aircraft go from flying using altitudes to using flight levels. The transition level is only really important during descent as the crew of an aircraft must go from using 1013 hPa to using QNH or RPS at the transition level in the descent. This question is quite badly made, but is easy enough to answer, as there is only one possible answer (although it is still not a good answer in our opinion). \"In approach and landing clearances.\" Correct (mostly). As per the information above, the approach clearance may include the transition level if requested by the pilot or so prescribed by the authority (some approaches will begin above the transition levels to some airports). We are not sure of the use of \"landing clearance\" here, as there is no mention of it in the landing clearance, and the vast majority of aircraft are cleared to land much after they descend through the transition level, but it is the only possible answer. \"When changing FL en-route.\" There is no mention of descent here, so one must assume that it is talking about a change of cruising altitude. This would usually be a climb, so the transition level would not be given. \"In their take-off clearance.\" The transition level is only required for descent through the transition layer, so would not be given at take-off. \"At the flight planning stage.\" The transition level is calculated by ATC depending on the conditions of the day. It is therefore changeable and not necessarily available at the flight planning stage (though it can often be calculated by the pilot if they really wish, but that is not \"receiving the transition level\").",

The appropriate ATS unit is usually the one you are currently in contact with, in this case, Paris ATC. These are the controllers who know most of the details about your flight, your current routing, position, etc. The pilot(s) may elect to speak to 121.5 MHz emergency frequency instead, as these controllers are more set up to handle emergencies, and have the benefit of extra training, and more available resources such as VDF auto-triangulation. The change to 121.5 MHz can be done without notifying the previous controller, as the emergency controllers will soon notify your previous ATC as to the situation. In reality, you would most likely want to stay on your current frequency to save time, as long as the controllers will be able to adequately deal with your emergency, and you can always change to 121.5 MHz if required later on.",

It is divided into three main parts: General (GEN), Enroute (ENR), and Aerodromes (AD), each covering specific aspects of air navigation and airport operations. The AIP is regularly updated to reflect changes in airspace structure, procedures, and regulations, ensuring that pilots and operators have access to the most current and accurate information for safe flight planning and operations. Jeppesen charts ( developed and maintained by Jeppesen, are industry-standard aeronautical charts used by pilots worldwide for flight planning and navigation. These charts present information such as airport layouts, departure and arrival procedures, enroute navigation, and approach procedures in a clear and standardized format, making them easy to read and understand during flight. Jeppesen charts are regularly updated and are widely respected for their accuracy, consistency, and user-friendly design, which helps pilots safely navigate complex airspaces and airport environments. They are often used in conjunction with the AIP to provide a complete picture of the air navigation environment. ICAO Annex 15 APPENDIX 1.

Please put any exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. ICAO Annex 15 Chapter 2. Definitions Aeronautical information service (AIS). A service established within the defined area of coverage responsible for the provision of aeronautical information/data necessary for the safety, regularity and efficiency of air navigation. We will go through each option: \"Air traffic control only.\" This is incorrect. An AIS is responsible for many things, not just air traffic control. \"Air traffic services.\" We believe that this is correct, as air traffic services have their own section within the AIP (which is part of the AIS), as well as covered by AICs, NOTAMs, etc. which also fall under the AIS. \"Flight licenses.\" This is not part of an AIC, and would be more part of the governing regulations of a country. \"Air operations.\" Whilst we previously had this reported as the correct answer, we have more recent reports saying that it is not correct. Some parts of air operations are covered in the AIS, as it covers the AIP, AIRAC, AICs, NOTAMs, etc., but we think that the examiner might be thinking about the regulations such as ICAO 8168 (PANS-OPS) and EU-OPS, which are not part of an AIS, of course, so has made this incorrect.",

YELLOW ALERT — Volcano known to be active from time to time and volcanic activity has recently increased significantly, volcano not currently considered dangerous but caution should be exercised; or — After an eruption, i.e. change in alert to yellow from red or orange - Volcanic activity has decreased significantly, volcano not currently considered dangerous but caution should be exercised. ORANGE ALERT — Volcanic eruption in progress but ash plume/cloud not reaching nor expected to reach FL250; or — Volcano dangerous, eruption likely but ash plume/cloud not expected to reach FL250. RED ALERT — Volcanic eruption in progress. Ash plume/cloud reported above FL250; or — Volcano dangerous, eruption likely, with ash plume/cloud expected to rise above FL250. Summary of ASHTAM color code: • Above FL250 => RED • Below FL250 => Orange • Yellow => Not currently dangerous • Green => Normal",

Wet ice is ice that is melting, or ice with a layer of water (any depth) on top. The various braking action of each surface is quite easy to work out. Compacted snow has a relatively rough surface, and with heavy weight will allow some movement of the snow beneath, allowing for some traction between tyres and the surface, especially if the tyres have good tread for snow operations. This will allow moderate and moderate-to-poor braking action in many cases. Ice, on the other hand, will not move, nor allow any purchase with treaded tyres (unless they are studded), but dry ice (not frozen carbon dioxide used in smoke machines) will at least have a small amount of traction with a (usually) grippy rubber tyre surface. Still, moderate-to-poor and poor braking action can be expected. Wet ice has the same downsides of ice, but now that top level traction is nearly completely gone, and the braking action can be expected to be poor to non-existent.",

One of the following elements on the surface of the runway: i) Compacted snow. Snow that has been compacted into a solid mass such that aeroplane tires, at operating pressures and loadings, will run on the surface without significant further compaction or rutting of the surface. ii) Dry snow. Snow from which a snowball cannot readily be made. iii) Frost. Frost consists of ice crystals formed from airborne moisture on a surface whose temperature is below freezing. Frost differs from ice in that the frost crystals grow independently and therefore have a more granular texture. iv) Ice. Water that has frozen or compacted snow that has transitioned into ice, in cold and dry conditions. v) Slush. Snow that is so water-saturated that water will drain from it when a handful is picked up or will splatter if stepped on forcefully. vi) Standing water. Water of depth greater than 3 mm. Note.— Running water of depth greater than 3 mm is reported as standing water by convention. vii) Wet ice. Ice with water on top of it or ice that is melting. viii) Wet snow. Snow that contains enough water content to be able to make a well-compacted, solid snowball, but water will not squeeze out.",

Clearway is expressed as a plane extending from the end of runway with up slop not exceeding 1.25% above which no object or terrain protrudes with exception of threshold lights. STOPWAY Stopway is the area at the end of take-off runway no less wide than the runway and centered upon extended centerline of runway and able to support the aeroplane during an aborted take-off without causing structural damage to the aeroplane. TORA (Take off Run Available) TORA is defined as length of runway suitable for normal operations. It need not always equal to LDA (landing distance available). TORA doesn’t include Stopway or Clearway. TODA (Take off Distance Available) TODA is the length of runway plus any clearway if available. In case no clearway exists, TODA is same as TORA. TODA includes ground as well as air segments. ASDA (Accelerate-Stop Distance Available) ASDA is used for calculation of V1. It is defined as sum of LDA/TORA (as applicable) and Stopway. In case take off is aborted the aircraft can be brought to a stop either on the runway or on Stopway. ASDA must not be used as TORA. LDA (Landing Distance Available) LDA is the runway length declared available and suitable for landing an airplane. Information on Clearway, Stopway, TORA, TODA, ASDA & LDA for different runways can be obtained from Aerodrome Information Publications, Jepessen Charts and RTOW charts. (TORA, TODA, ASDA, and LDA) would be equal if the runway is without a stopway or clearway, and also without a displaced threshold.",

Simple approach lighting system 5.3.4.2 A simple approach lighting system shall consist of a row of lights on the extended centre line of the runway extending, whenever possible, over a distance of not less than 420 m from the threshold with a row of lights forming a crossbar 18 m or 30 m in length at a distance of 300 m from the threshold. The figure shows a simple approach lighting system. According to ICAO Annex 14, a simple approach lighting system is used for non-precision runways, and non-precision approaches can be executed in such runways. ILS is a precision approach type, so it cannot be executed. LOC is a non-precision approach, so the approach lighting system shown is suitable for a LOC approach.",

Learning Objective 010.09.04.03.04: Describe the basic installations of a simple approach lighting system including the dimensions and distances normally used. Source: ICAO Annex 14, Volume 1, Chapter 5, 5.3.4.2 ICAO Annex 14, Volume 1, Chapter 5, 5.3.4.2 5.3.4.2 A simple approach lighting system shall consist of a row of lights on the extended centre line of the runway extending, whenever possible, over a distance of not less than 420 m from the threshold with a row of lights forming a crossbar 18 m or 30 m in length at a distance of 300 m from the threshold. The annex above is from EASA air ops, and is much easier to understand than some of the ICAO Annex 14 images. Whilst the crossbar of a simple approach lighting system can be 18 m or 30 m, only 30 m is a viable option in this question, and should be at 300 m from the threshold.",

During flight planning the flight crew calculates the accelerate-stop distance required based on the planned take-off mass and forecasted environmental conditions. Then the flight crew compares the accelerate-stop distance required with the accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA) of the departure aerodrome. The accelerate-stop distance required should be equal or less than the accelerate-stop distance available. In the given scenario, the pilot calculates the accelerate-stop distance required for zero wind conditions and confirms that it is less than the accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA) which provides a stopping margin. Due to weather change, a tailwind is reported by the ATC. This means that the actual accelerate-stop distance required will be higher than planned and the stopping margin reduces. ICAO Annex 14 - DEFINITIONS Declared distances. c) Accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA). The length of the take-off run available plus the length of the stopway, if provided. Stopway. A defined rectangular area on the ground at the end of take-off run available prepared as a suitable area in which an aircraft can be stopped in the case of an abandoned take-off. ATTACHMENT A. GUIDANCE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTARY TO ANNEX 14, VOLUME I 2. Clearways and stopways 2.2 The aeroplane performance operating limitations require a length which is enough to ensure that the aeroplane can, after starting a take-off, either be brought safely to a stop or complete the take-off safely. For the purpose of discussion it is supposed that the runway, stopway and clearway lengths provided at the aerodrome are only just adequate for the aeroplane requiring the longest take-off and accelerate-stop distances, taking into account its take-off mass, runway characteristics and ambient atmospheric conditions. Under these circumstances there is, for each take-off, a speed, called the decision speed; below this speed, the take-off must be abandoned if an engine fails, while above it the take-off must be completed. A very long take-off run and take-off distance would be required to complete a take-off when an engine fails before the decision speed is reached, because of the insufficient speed and the reduced power available. There would be no difficulty in stopping in the remaining accelerate-stop distance available provided action is taken immediately. In these circumstances the correct course of action would be to abandon the take-off.",

Simple approach lighting system 5.3.4.2 A simple approach lighting system shall consist of a row of lights on the extended centre line of the runway extending, whenever possible, over a distance of not less than 420 m from the threshold with a row of lights forming a crossbar 18 m or 30 m in length at a distance of 300 m from the threshold. The figure shows a simple approach lighting system. According to ICAO Annex 14, a simple approach lighting system is used for non-precision runways, and non-precision approaches can be executed in such runways. ILS is a precision approach type, so it cannot be executed. LOC is a non-precision approach, so the approach lighting system shown is suitable for a LOC approach.",

Source: ICAO Annex 14, Volume 1, Chapter 5.5 Markers Edge Markers are unlit objects of particular size and demarcate the edges of runways, taxiways, stopways, and landing area boundaries. This question is asking about runways, and of course, unpaved runways, as paved runways have very clear markings that do not require further edge markers. The below extract from ICAO annex 14 describes the use of RWY-edge markers on unpaved runways. It states that they should be provided when the surface does not clearly indicate the location of the runway, in comparison with the surface around the runway. This means that not all unpaved runways should have them. 5.5.2 Unpaved runway edge markers Application 5.5.2.1 Recommendation.— Markers should be provided when the extent of an unpaved runway is not clearly indicated by the appearance of its surface compared with that of the surrounding ground. Location 5.5.2.2 Recommendation.— Where runway lights are provided, the markers should be incorporated in the light fixtures. Where there are no lights, markers of flat rectangular or conical shape should be placed so as to delimit the runway clearly. Characteristics 5.5.2.3 Recommendation.— The flat rectangular markers should have a minimum size of 1 m by 3 m and should be placed with their long dimension parallel to the runway centre line. The conical markers should have a height not exceeding 50 cm.",

Clearway is expressed as a plane extending from the end of runway with up slop not exceeding 1.25% above which no object or terrain protrudes with exception of threshold lights. STOPWAY Stopway is the area at the end of take-off runway no less wide than the runway and centered upon extended centerline of runway and able to support the aeroplane during an aborted take-off without causing structural damage to the aeroplane. TORA (Take off Run Available) TORA is defined as length of runway suitable for normal operations. It need not always equal to LDA (landing distance available). TORA doesn’t include Stopway or Clearway. TODA (Take off Distance Available) TODA is the length of runway plus any clearway if available. In case no clearway exists, TODA is same as TORA. TODA includes ground as well as air segments. ASDA (Accelerate-Stop Distance Available) ASDA is used for calculation of V1. It is defined as sum of LDA/TORA (as applicable) and Stopway. In case take off is aborted the aircraft can be brought to a stop either on the runway or on Stopway. ASDA must not be used as TORA. LDA (Landing Distance Available) LDA is the runway length declared available and suitable for landing an airplane. Information on Clearway, Stopway, TORA, TODA, ASDA & LDA for different runways can be obtained from Aerodrome Information Publications, Jepessen Charts and RTOW charts. (TORA, TODA, ASDA, and LDA) would be equal if the runway is without a stopway or clearway, and also without a displaced threshold.",

The order of reporting should be from the threshold having the lower runway designation number, e.g. 4/5/4. Suitable combinations of numbers may be used to indicate varying conditions over runway segments. If more than one deposit is present on the same portion of the runway, they should be reported in sequence from the top to the bottom of the total deposit, e.g. 57/56/57. Drifts, depths of deposit appreciably greater than the average values or other significant characteristics of the deposits may be reported under Item T in plain language. If a damp condition is reported, then the reason for this should be clarified in Item T. 5/5/5 → First third of the runway is reported as '5' (wet snow), second third of the runway is reported as '5' (wet snow) and last third of the runway is reported as '5' (wet snow).",

The length of runway which is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an aeroplane landing. The pilot before take-off must calculate: TOR (Take-off Run): It is the required runway length for take-off. Calculating it ensures that the aircraft can safely accelerate to take-off speed and lift off within the available runway length, considering factors such as aircraft weight, weather conditions, and airport elevation. TOD (Take-off Distance): It consists of two segments, the take-off ground run and the airborne distance to a “screen height”. Calculating it ensures that the aircraft can safely take-off and execute its initial climb within protected airspace. ASD (Accelerate-Stop Distance): This is the distance required for the aircraft to accelerate to take-off speed and, in the event of an aborted take-off, come to a complete stop on the runway. Calculating it ensures that the aircraft can safely abort take-off until a specified speed and come to a complete stop on the runway. LD (Landing Distance): This is the distance required for the aircraft to land safely and come to a complete stop on the runway. Calculating it ensures that the aircraft can safely land at the destination airport. and compare them with the declared distances of the departure airport (TOR, TOD and ASD) and the destination and alternate airports (LD).",

Disposition of baggage separated from its owner; ICAO Annex 9, Chapter 4, C. Release and clearance of export and import cargo. Looking at the sources quoted in the Learning Objective above, we see that \"Consignments declared as personal effects and transported as unaccompanied baggage shall be cleared under simplified arrangements.\". The sources from the LO are shown in the two annexes above. This means that the customs documentation and arrangements for unaccompanied baggage that has been mishandled, etc. will be much simplified, over the requirements for standard cargo. This is in place to make it much easier for operators to get passengers their baggage back in the event of mishandling. This question is referring to the customs (facilitation) aspect of unaccompanied baggage, not the security aspect, which is covered under different rules (some of which are shown in the annexes above).",

Looking at the sources quoted in the Learning Objective above, we see that \"Consignments declared as personal effects and transported as unaccompanied baggage shall be cleared under simplified arrangements.\". The sources from the LO are shown in the two annexes above. This means that the customs documentation and arrangements for unaccompanied baggage that has been mishandled, etc. will be much simplified, over the requirements for standard cargo. This is in place to make it much easier for operators to get passengers their baggage back in the event of mishandling. This question is referring to the customs (facilitation) aspect of unaccompanied baggage, not the security aspect, which is covered under different rules (some of which are shown in the annexes above).",

CMC's serve as an identity for crew members and provide them visa-free entrance when on duty seeking temporaty access to a state. Therefore, another means of identity card (i.e. passport) is not necessary, and visa is not necessary either. However, it does not replace the pilot's licence or the logbook, but the license is not required for identification.",

Note.— If an aircraft is in the distress phase, the rescue coordination centre has to be notified immediately in accordance with 5.2.1. The above regulation states that when the aircraft is in the distress phase (as is the case wen a distress message has been received), the ATSU (air traffic services unit) should immediately inform the rescue coordination centre.

Looking at the sources quoted in the Learning Objective above, we see that \"Consignments declared as personal effects and transported as unaccompanied baggage shall be cleared under simplified arrangements.\". The sources from the LO are shown in the two annexes above. This means that the customs documentation and arrangements for unaccompanied baggage that has been mishandled, etc. will be much simplified, over the requirements for standard cargo. This is in place to make it much easier for operators to get passengers their baggage back in the event of mishandling. This question is referring to the customs (facilitation) aspect of unaccompanied baggage, not the security aspect, which is covered under different rules (some of which are shown in the annexes above).",
