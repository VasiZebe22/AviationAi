            "explanation": "Note: This question has two correct answers, both \"Diurnal solar heating\" and \"A cold front crossing the area\" would dissipate the advection fog in the METAR. Early feedback and knowledge leaned on the side of \"Diurnal solar heating\", but most recent feedback shows the cold front to be the correct answer. See the comments for the most recent feedback. UPDATE: The Hungarian CAA have approved an appeal based on this question (which said that two correct answers were present), stating, \"The cold front is the right option, because clearance occurs with a change of air mass, or less commonly with an increase in surface wind. The term \"on its own” means the weather phenomena associated with cold front. Of course not the definition of cold front will improve the visibility, but the phenomena. Hovewer diurnal solar heating can also be a correct answer.\" We think that the cold front and diurnal solar heating are both perfectly correct, so we hope that they have removed this question from the database now. If this comes up in an exam, you may appeal it, quoting the Hungarian CAA above if necessary. Advection fog is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion. The surface can be land or sea and it can appear by day or night. Most commonly, the dissipation of advection fog is by a change of air mass, replacing the moist air with dry air. For example, in this question, the movement of a cold front would mean that the new air is not the same air than cooled overnight close to the ground, and so the advection fog will dissipate. However, sometimes solar heating on the land is sufficient to raise the temperature to the condensation point and the fog evaporates.",

This forms clouds, when the temperature drops below the dew point as air rises. As the clouds are being forced to rise by the terrain (and we have not been told that precipitation has yet begun to fall), the airmass is cooling, and the colder air will not be able to hold as much moisture in vapour form, so more and more of the stored vapour will condense into droplets or ice crystals (depending on the freezing level). As this is unlikely to make the current droplets/crystals larger due to the rate of coalescence usually being lower than the rate of droplet formation, the only possible correct answer is that the concentration of droplets/crystals in the cloud will increase.",

For this to happen, the parcel of air must be saturated => unable to hold all the water it contains in vapour form, so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form. The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level - it is also the height of the cloud base. The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to the dew point temperature. Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud. There are two ways by which saturation is reached. (a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more. (b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to 'hold' any more water. => Therefore, we can conclude that 2 unsaturated parcels of air will form a cloud when they cool down to the dew point temperature, becoming saturated => and condensation starts.",

In the troposphere, inversions cause an incredibly stable layer of atmosphere, which reduces the upwards motion of cumuliform clouds, and limits the vertical extent of stratiform clouds completely. Stratiform clouds can form for many reasons, such as turbulence in the air causing mixing, orographic or frontal uplift, etc., but they always occur in a stable layer of atmosphere. When the air gets pushed up or mixed up enough to reach its dewpoint, the cloud base forms, and if the air is raised above this, then the cloud continues upwards as high as the air is pushed/mixed. An inversion, however, is much too stable, and any air moving into the inversion will either fall back out of the layer, as the layer is a lot warmer than the air below (preventing mixing of the air), or just warm up above the dewpoint and stop forming cloud. This means that stratiform clouds remain below an inversion in the atmosphere, and this limits their growth.",

Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or when the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated. Freezing fog occurs when fog forms at temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain liquid. They become supercooled water droplets (SCWDs) remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This is the same process as having SCWD within a cloud. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals are formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind, or on the leading edge of a wing that flies through it. Freezing fog can cause ice accumulation on the aircraft and the ground, so is also a dangerous weather phenomenon if not treated correctly.",

We have some slightly conflicting feedback about wording for this one, so please let us know if you see either question in the exam, and what you can remember about them, thank you! RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly occurring in autumn and winter. The cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it (which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as a ground inversion. Inversions are very stable areas, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air inside the inversion drops below its dewpoint CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog. Calm or very light wind – any heavier wind (above 8 kt) causes turbulent mixing of the lower air, breaking up the ground inversion, and lifting the fog into low stratus cloud. Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a much better heat conductor than sea surface. To go through the options: \"In the inversion layer there is a lot of turbulence, which causes the formation of fog.\" There is very little turbulence in an inversion layer. \"The decrease of temperature with the height close to the surface is abnormally high.\" In a ground inversion, the air above the ground increases with height until the top of the inversion is reached, which is the opposite of this option. \"The air cools down close to the ground, without any convection.\" Correct. The air in contact with the ground cools down by conduction, which makes the air close to the ground much colder than the air above it, this is an inversion, and when that air reaches its dew point, fog will form. \"In the inversion layer the air is unstable, which allows significant cooling close to the ground. An inversion is always an absolutely stable layer of air.",

A towering cumulus cloud is a large, white, fluffy cloud that can reach great heights, but it is not as tall and wide as a cumulonimbus cloud. Another difference is that a cumulonimbus cloud often has an anvil-shaped top, which is caused by the cloud reaching the upper limit of the troposphere and the winds spreading the top of the cloud out horizontally.

Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly autumn and winter. The cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it (which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as a ground inversion. Inversions are very stable areas, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air under the inversion drops below its dewpoint CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog. Calm or very light wind – any heavier wind (above 8 kt) causes turbulent mixing of the lower air, breaking up the ground inversion, and lifting the fog into low stratus cloud. Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a much better heat conductor than sea surface.",

Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation. Movement of air over damp ground or water surface increases its humidity. HUMID AIR. High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE.

            "explanation": "050.05.02.01.08: Explain the relationship between moisture content and visibility during different types of winter precipitation (e.g. large vs small snowflakes). Moisture content and type of precipitation are the main factors of visibility during precipitation. For instance, rain has relatively good visibility, as the light is scattered a little through each raindrop, but they are relatively see through still. More importantly, rain is a very dense form of precipitation, as so there are less raindrops than for a snow shower of the same moisture content. Snow, therefore, has quite poor visibility, depending on the intensity of course. A light snow shower would still have better visibility than a heavy tropical rain shower. For this question, we should consider each option: A) \"Visibility in precipitation with large snow flakes is worse than in rain.\" This is absolutely correct, snow flakes give worse visibility than rain. Large snowflakes are worse still, as they block more light. B) \"Visibility in a shower with blowing snow is better than in heavy rain.\" Blowing snow is where the wind picks up the snow from the ground and the snow which falls during a snow shower, creating very low visibility indeed, as low as 1 metre visibility. Heavy rain is not as bad as this, so this is incorrect. C) \"Visibility in heavy snow is better than in drizzle with small water droplets.\" I think it is quite obvious that visibility is very bad in heavy snow, and not nearly as bad in drizzle, so this is incorrect. D) \"Regardless of the moisture content, the visibility in rain is worse than in snow.\" As discussed above, it is more difficult to see through snow, which is a much less dense form of precipitation, so takes up more space, and is also more opaque than rain. This is therefore incorrect.",

Hail is less common in the tropics, despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude. Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations. Damaging hail can be met at any height in the cloud, also below the cloud and below the anvil. Hailstorms are most common in the midlatitudes and usually last around 15 minutes. Mountainous areas increase the risk of icing as they help the formation of stratiform or cumuliform clouds with large supercooled water content. Orography enhances the updraft of air and thus enhances the development of water droplets that are large in size - this is mostly on the upwind (windward) side of a mountain and above the ridge. If frontal systems cross a mountain, icing can be extremely strong due to the uplifting effect.",

Within these CB clouds, precipitation particles have the opportunity to grow larger due to the aggregation of ice crystals and supercooled water droplets, ultimately resulting in the formation of hail. When the size of these ice particles exceeds 5 mm, they are referred to as hailstones. As the hailstones continue to grow, they eventually reach a critical size that cannot be sustained by the upward air currents within the cloud. Consequently, they begin to fall from the cloud toward the ground. However, there is a possibility for hailstones to rise again if they are carried into an area with a strong updraft. This process can lead to the repeated aggregation of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstones, contributing to their further growth. This repeated cycle of aggregation and growth results in the layered structure of hailstones, resembling the layers of a cabbage or an onion. Additionally, the hailstone can also grow through sublimation, where water vapor in the cloud condenses directly onto the hailstone, further increasing its size.",

This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature. Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature.

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

It is our belief that this question asked in this format has the answer of \"soft hail/graupel\", which are abbreviated to GS, and come from CBs, which obviously contain moderate to severe turbulence. The most recent feedback indicates that two options have \"GS\" in the first part, and we believe those to be correct in the real exam, but for the other two (both incorrect) options, there could be some discrepancies in the real exam. Frozen precipitation can form in many different ways, and in fact, due to the height of clouds, a lot of the time, precipitation falls in frozen form and melts into regular rain on the way down. The size and appearance of frozen precipitation dictates its designation. For instance, the type of precipitation dictated is called soft hail (or graupel), and comes from convective clouds, such as Cb (Cumulonimbus) and tCu (towering cumulus). They are smaller than hail, at under 5 mm diameter, and are formed when snow falls, but collides with supercooled water droplets on the way down, forming a hybrid particle that freezes, forming small opaque balls. The process is remarkably similar to how airframes build up rime ice, but on a much smaller scale. To finish off the question, it is common to associate convective clouds such as Cbs with moderate to severe turbulence.",

To check all the possible answers: Snowfall is far more visibility reducing that ice pellets and freezing rain. Heavy snow is obviously more visibility reducing than light snow, due to the amount. Snowflakes DO obscure more visibility than corresponding water droplets. Hail from thunderstorms would be far more densely packed with ice than corresponding snow, meaning that there would be many times less hailstones than snowflakes, and therefore they would not be as visibility reducing as the snow, which would cover much more of the sky. This makes the most correct answer \"snowflakes, due to their open structure, obscure more than water droplets.\"",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

This gentle slope results in minimal vertical flow, leading to stratiform clouds and light to moderate continuous drizzle, rain, or snow along the warm front. In contrast, the cold front slopes backward because the heavy, cold air forces itself underneath the warmer, lighter air. With a slope of between 1:50 and 1:80, the cold front is steeper than the warm front but still relatively gentle, causing stratiform clouds due to the gentle uplift. However, the cold front also has a bulging \"cold nose\" near the surface, creating an unstable area where warm, buoyant air lies beneath cold air. This instability triggers rapid vertical uplift, resulting in large cumuliform clouds.",

The air being lifted up the mountain slopes by the wind (called orographic lifting) causes icing to be more intense than it is usual under identical conditions over low, flat terrain. It is known to produce moderate to severe icing conditions. Icing is greater over the ridges than over valleys and greater on the windward side than on the leeward side. The lifting of the cold unstable by the mountains results in the formation of more-or-less continuous supercooled clouds. Also, the orographically-induced updrafts permit the air to support larger cloud droplets than otherwise, so that the icing is more intense. Furthermore, dust from the mountain slopes induce ice accretion - due to the presence of freezing nucleus. Freezing nucleus, any particle that, when present in a mass of supercooled water, will induce growth of an ice crystal about itself; most ice crystals in the atmosphere are thought to form on freezing nuclei.

We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. Location 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties. Location 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. At location 3, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter. This would line up with the METAR in the question. At location 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. The lack of heavy rain is the biggest indicator that it is NOT location 1, where heavy rain is pretty much garaunteed.",

In this question, the fast moving cold front over warm land is more \"aggressive\" than the slow moving cold front over cold land. Slower cold fronts (called \"active\" cold fronts) tend to contain more weather as we have eluded to in our explanation for question 508178, but the warm land would likely have a greater effect on the weather than the speed of the front. Immediately we can see that the most likely location for these types of highly convective weather is going to be on the steeper cold front (instead of a warm front), the more aggressive of the two simple weather fronts. Yes, a warm occlusion will include a bit of cold front at altitude, but as it is a warm occlusion, the majority of it acts as a warm front. During summer, the presence of a swiftly advancing cold front over warm land can create highly unstable conditions, leading to moderate to severe turbulence and the development of thunderstorms with substantial rainfall and hail. Additionally, this fast-moving cold front has the potential to generate severe squall line thunderstorms, occurring along or ahead of the actual front.",

Please send us any further exam feedback via the comments, by email to info@atplquestions.com or using the exam feedback section of your dashboard, thanks! POLAR FRONT DEPRESSIONS. These move eastwards along the semi stationary front “Polar front” which is located between 35ºN and 65ºN (higher latitudes in Summer, lower in Winter). An air mass is simply a large portion of air in the Earth's atmosphere, defined by where it has been \"formed\" (a high pressure, stable source region where it develops its initial characteristics) and the track it has taken to get somewhere. For Western Europe, the air masses are classified as T(Tropical), P(Polar) and A(Arctic) - in terms of their thermal qualities - and c(continental) or m(maritime) - in terms of their water content. Note that Artic air is from directly North of Europe, whereas Polar air is from the Polar cell fo the atmosphere, so source regions like Siberia or Northern Canada/Greenland. The Polar front splits Sub-tropical air (which we refer to as Tropical for European air masses) from Polar air. Therefore, when a Polar front depression forms (in the North Atlantic specifically), the warm sector to the South of the depression is that Tropical air, whereas the rest of the depression is surrounded by the Polar air. Therefore, in this question; (1) is Tropical air in the warm sector, (2) is Polar air ahead of the depression (East), and (3) is the Polar air behind the depression (West). (4) is a little more complicated. It is the air North of the depression. From the options, we have already narrowed down the correct answer, and that states that the air North of the depression \"may be\" Arctic. This is not always the case, but certainly possible, especially in Winter when Artic air can easily flow down from the North Pole. Often, for a new depression, this air would also be Polar, but later down the life cycle, it can drag Artic air down to it. Also, the question says \"may be\", rather than \"is\", which we are happy to consider as being correct.",

If you happen to come across a similar question in your official examination, we kindly request that you inform us. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. When a polar front approaches a mountain range in southern Europe, the expected weather conditions can vary. However, there are some general patterns that can be observed. Typically, as the polar front encounters the mountain range, it is forced to rise due to the barrier presented by the mountains. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation. The precipitation can be in the form of rain, snow, or a mix of both, depending on the altitude and temperature. The interaction between the polar front and the mountain range can result in significant weather changes. Some of the common weather conditions associated with this scenario include: Increased precipitation: The forced ascent of the air along the mountain range can lead to enhanced precipitation, potentially causing heavy rainfall or snowfall. Strong winds: The interaction between the polar front and the mountains can generate strong and gusty winds, particularly in the vicinity of the mountain passes and slopes. Thunderstorms: The lifting of warm and moist air along the mountain range can contribute to the development of thunderstorms, especially if there is a strong contrast in air masses. Rapid weather changes: The passage of the polar front can bring about rapid shifts in weather conditions, with alternating periods of rain, sunshine, and possibly even dramatic temperature fluctuations.",

Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Note: Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low. ADVECTION FOG. Is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion.

Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.",

When the cold front catches up with the warm front, the warm sector is lifted. WARM OCCLUSION: the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air behind the cold front. The cold air behind the cold front rises over colder air ahead of the warm front. The \"less cold\" air rises over the leading colder air. This forces the cold front aloft (It \"climbs up\" the back of the warm front). Warm, moist and unstable air is lifted. The warm front acts as normal, but the extra cold front forces air upwards, causing embedded CBs (they are embedded within the usual warm front clouds). COLD OCCLUSION: the air behind the cold front is colder than the air ahead of the warm front. The cold air behind the cold front undercuts the less cold air ahead of the warm front. Warm front aloft. Warm, moist and stable air is lifted. To go through each option: \"In a warm occlusion, the warm, moist tropical maritime air overrides the cold polar maritime air ahead. Precipitation and radiation fog occur ahead of the surface position of the front.\" Whilst this is partially correct, it refers to a warm front ONLY, and also says radiation fog, which is not correct even for a warm front itself. \"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and cold front. At the surface, it resembles a warm front with embedded CBs. The precipitation falls ahead of the surface position of the front.\" Correct. As can be seen in the explanation and figures above, a warm occlusion is both a warm and a cold front, with exactly these characteristics. \"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and a cold front. At the surface, it resembles a cold front with embedded CBs and heavy rain, which are located close to just behind the surface position of the front.\" Incorrect. At the surface it resembles a warm front (the warm front is the one that reaches the ground), and the precipitation occurs in front of the where the front meets the ground. \"In a warm occlusion, the cool polar continental air mass undercuts the colder arctic maritime air mass. The rain band just ahead of the surface position of the front has embedded CBs, severe turbulence, and hail. A thick frontal fog follows the surface position of the front.\" Incorrect, there is no \"undercutting\" in a warm occlusion. All the air rises over the leading air, as the leading air is the coldest (and therefore most dense).",

            "explanation": "WARM FRONT. Warm air replacing cold air. The warm air is forced to rise over the cold air as part of slowly pushing the cold air out of the way Conditions associated with a warm front: Surface winds: A change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of any front. Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the colder air mass) are typically from the South/South-West, but once the front passes through, winds usually veer around, and come from the West/South-West (in the warmer air mass). The wind veering actually tells us nothing, as all standard Northern Hemisphere fronts cause the wind to veer. Temperature: steady before the front. An increase is usually observed at the front. Behind the warm front, it is steady again. Pressure: As the front approaches, the pressure gradually decreases. Then once the front passes, the pressure should remain constant, at the lowest pressure value(whilst within the warm sector). Clouds: As a warm front approaches, the clouds can be expected to begin at high levels about 500 nm ahead of the front, gradually reducing to the ground as the front passes. In stable air, you can expect Cs, Ci, As, Ns, St and some frontal fog. In unstable air, the rising warm air can trigger convective activity, such as Cu or Cb, with a good chance of the CBs being embedded in the surrounding clouds (as mentioned in this question). Precipitation: Heavy rain can be expected ahead of the front. Thunderstorms can occur if the airmass is unstable. The rain tends to turn into drizzle as the front passes. Visibility: Generally poor, due to the potential for fog and drizzle, but this can vary quite a lot depending on the air masses involved. => The real indicators in this question are the pressure (stops reducing), meaning a warm front, and the embedded CBs meaning unstable air.",

Depending on the intensity and season, these showers can manifest as rain, snow, or hail, and there is also the possibility of thunderstorms forming. Visibility: Showery precipitation along the cold front typically leads to a reduction in visibility, which can be significant during heavy precipitation and snowfall.

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. Conditions associated with a cold front: Surface winds: Sudden change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of a cold front. Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the warmer air mass) are typically out of the southwest, but once the front passes through, winds usually shift around to the northwest (in the colder air mass). Temperature: steady before the front. A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold). Pressure: before the front, it decreases slightly. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front. Clouds: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB. However, if the air is stable cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (and stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.) Precipitation: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected. Along with thunderstorms and hail, if the air is unstable. Visibility: good, except in precipitation. => Considering the above, we can conclude a cold front in stable atmosphere is being described.",

            "explanation": "This question is a little tricky as it is asking about the effect of the warm front, not the foehn effect. The warm front means that the air in front of the warm front is colder than the air that comes after the warm front. The warmer air behind rides up over the cooler air in front, creating the slanted front. This slant means that the cloud base drops as the front gets closer to a position. With a few hundred miles to go before the front passes overhead, you can expect high level cirrus clouds, followed by lowering clouds of cirrostratus, altostratus, nimbostratus (rain clouds), and finally low level stratus with some fog and stratus fractus. In relation to this question then, the front is travelling from West to East, so the front is passing over the western faces of the mountains, which will have a very low cloud base and rain/fog. The Eastern faces, however, have yet to be passed over, so will have a higher cloud base than 2 000 ft, and are in the cold sector, so the temperature will be lower there also. There are a few questions that exist similar to this, but without the presence of the warm front. This makes them affected more so by the foehn effect, which is where the windward side of the mountains gets rained on, reducing the moisture in the air, so the air is drier and warmer on the lee-side. The passing of a warm front is a much larger event, and is therefore enough to negate any such temperature change due to the foehn effect.",

That is where the warm sector air above the frontal surface precipitates raindrops that are warmer than 0°C, into an area that is colder than 0°C. If an aircraft is within that cold sector, then the airframe will be below freezing temperature, and the droplets will be around 0°C, which will then freeze upon hitting the airframe, causing one of the most dangerous types of ice accumulation, rain-ice. Rain-ice builds up incredibly quickly on all parts of the upper surface of the wing, not just the leading edge, meaning that standard anti-ice and de-icing systems are only partially effective, and often completely overpowered by the ice accretion. As warm fronts are very shallow, rain ice triangles are very wide but not usually very tall, in this case only 1000 ft. This means that the best way to avoid them is to fly above or beneath the region in which they can occur. Also, it is best to fly perpendicular to the front (therefore parallel to its direction of movement), so the rain-ice triangle danger can be passed through as quickly as possible, rather than staying near it for unnecessarily long. Unfortunately, this is not possible as there will most likely be clouds in the warm sector at the level that is being flown (the pilot is VMC only), and the pilot has to traverse the warm sector anyway within the cold sector to reach their destination. In the case of this pilot who is licensed for VMC flight only, they cannot climb into the NS clouds above, and should instead remain under 1000 ft (the freezing level in the cold sector) to remain out of the rain-ice triangle. It is useful to note that there is a chance of ice pellets at this altitude, as the raindrops may have frozen on their descent. This is still far better than being inside the region of freezing rain.",

            "explanation": "Polar maritime (mPc) is the most common air mass to affect the British Isles. Cold, moist, NW airflow. This air mass is characterised by frequent showers at any time of the year. On approaching the UK, the warmer ground causes the air mass to warm from below, becoming unstable. This gives rise to Cumulus and Cumulonimbus, heavy showers (sometimes hail and thunderstorms). Visibility is good (except in showers). At night inland the cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal conditions for radiation fog. If an air mass flows from cold to warmer regions, it will be heated from underneath, which makes it unstable. Therefore, polar and arctic air masses become unstable, whereas tropical air masses become more stable when travelling to colder areas. Further info on Air Masses: Air masses are classified according to moisture content, source or type and temperature using a 3-letter system: First letter - moisture content: Continental (c) Maritime (m) Second letter - source region or type (latitude/temperature): Equatorial. (E) Tropical. (T) Polar. (P) Arctic. (A) Third letter: temperature, c(old) or w(arm) Hence the 5 air masses aﬀecting Europe are: AIR MASS SOURCE SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS Arctic maritime, mAc Polar ice cap. Only experienced during NH winter stable very cold and dry. POLAR MARITIME, mPc Northwest area of North Atlantic stable, cold, absolute humidity low, relative humidity high Polar Continental, cPc Siberia (winter only) northern Russia Stable, very cold and dry. it is typically colder than the Arctic maritime air Tropical Maritime, mTw The Azores anticyclone Warm, stable, absolute humidity high, RH high. Tropical continental, cTw N Africa/SE Europe warm, dry, stable.",

            "explanation": "Refer to figure Ahead of a warm front, freezing rain can be encountered. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. It can cause significant accumulations of Clear Ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes. Now, let's analyse each option individually: \"Fly along searching for an opening.\" and \"Orbit and wait for improvement.\". Incorrect. The question states that the pilot is in the planning phase, it does not make sense to plan an orbit. In such circumstances, it is safer and cost-effective to delay the departure. Furthermore, flying along the front trying to find an opening is rarely an option due to fuel available and airspace restrictions. \"Descend low as possible, staying at 500 ft AGL, even if it means flying below MSA and entering IMC.\" Incorrect. MSA stands for minimum sector altitude, an aircraft must not descend below the local MSA. \"Plan his/her route through the warm front on the shortest way possible.\" Correct. This is the most correct option available. Avoid any signs of precipitation.",

The temperature and humidity properties are obtained by the air remaining roughly stationary over a surface where conditions are constant for some length of time (High Pressure). Therefore, at source, all air masses are stable. The basic properties of stability, temperature and humidity can change as an air mass moves over surfaces with diﬀerent properties. Air masses moving over the surface of the Earth have the capacity to transport significant thermal and humidity characteristics over great distances. The characteristics of an air mass depend on: The source region How long the air has been over the source region Modifications (if any) of the air mass as it moves away from the source.",

            "explanation": "FRONTAL FOG. Occurs at a warm front or occlusion. The main cause – precipitation lowering the cloud base to the ground. Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the warm front. Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low. ADVECTION FOG. Often observed behind a warm front. Note:\"The wind backs more at the warm front than at the cold front.\" INCORRECT. At the both the warm and cold front, the wind veers sharply. \"While occluding the warm front always becomes a front aloft.\" INCORRECT. In a warm occlusion, the cold air behind the cold front rises over the colder air ahead of the warm fron => cold front aloft. \"The precipitation zone of the cold front is in general wider than the precipitation zone of the warm front.\" INCORRECT. A cold front commonly brings a narrow band of precipitation that follows along the leading edge of the cold front.",

From here on we will discuss it in relation to the Northern Hemisphere, but just reverse the North and South directions for the Southern Hemisphere Polar Front. To the North of the Polar Front sits the high pressure zone of the North Pole and the very cold Arctic Circle. To the South of the Polar front sits the subtropical high pressure belt (the Azores high in the Atlantic). This means that the air wants to flow towards the Polar Front from both directions (pressure gradient force), but the air turns right due to the Coriolis effect, so the wind to the North of the front is East-to-West and the air to the South of the front is West-East. This scenario is unstable, and gives rise to travelling lows. Refer to the annex above - it uses different names for the stages. Initial stage (Frontogenesis) - The first stage is triggered by a small change in circumstances, the triggers are many, but are not important. The warm air mass begins to push into the cold air mass, creating a kink in the previously non-moving Polar Front. Mature Stage - This is where the cold sector begins to \"fight back\", and develops a cold front to claim back some of the land from the warm sector. The depression usually reaches its lowest pressure in this stage, and this stage can last for a good few days. It brings the familiar view of a cold front \"chasing a warm front\". Occluded Stage - The cold front has now caught up to the warm front at the centre of the depression, where the weather appears to look like both fronts pass together. Here, the warm sector no longer reaches the ground, and has been lifted into the air in this region. The fronts continue to occlude, and act like a clothing zipper, \"zipping up\" from the base out towards the edge. Dying Stage - The fronts are now almost completely occluded, and the depression is beginning to \"fill in\" with pressure. The whole system is beginning to collapse and the warm sector which initially invaded has become isolated from the rest of the warm air to the south, and is forced upwards into the atmosphere where it will disperse. A few things can happen here, including back-bent occlusions, and secondary depressions which may continue to develop. The dying stage is often accelerated by the depression moving over land, where the air has more friction with the land, and there is no longer a steady source of moisture beneath to feed the system. Through this whole life cycle, the system is moving towards the East (with some North/South movement according to the Jetstream, Polar Front, etc.), as the wind in the warm sector controls the direction.",

We cannot see how this is possible, so please send us any further feedback you may have about this, thank you! Mid Latitude Depression development 1. CYCLOGENESIS STAGE – this is known as the initial stage of the cyclone’s life cycle. In this stage, a boundary separates opposing fronts of cold and warm air. When an upper level disturbance moves over the front, it causes a wave to form. Cyclonic shear begins to happen when the warm and cold fronts slide against each other => which generates the spinning motion characteristic of cyclones. 2. DEVELOPED/MATURE STAGE – during this stage, the wave formed during the initial phase grows as warm air replaces the space left behind by moving the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front, intensifying the cyclonic circulation. 3. OCCLUDED STAGE - In the mid-latitude cyclone’s third stage, the denser cold front catches up with the warm front. Because the warm air isn’t dense enough to displace the cold air ahead of it, it shifts up and slides above the cold air in its path. This action eventually forms an occluded front, in which the wave transforms into a loop, which is narrower at its base and cuts off the supply of warm air. 4. DISSOLVING/ FRONTOLYSIS STAGE - The final stage of the cyclone occurs when the loop formed by the cold front boundary surrounding the low-pressure pocket of warm air closes. This cuts off the supply of warm moist air and the lifting force caused by the interaction between the cold and warm fronts. The loss of the convergence and uplift mechanisms cause the cyclone to dissolve, and the low pressure system gradually stabilizes.",

We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. At location 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. Ahead of the warm front where the freezing level in the cold air is lower than the freezing level in the warm air above it, as the rain falls from the warmer air (above 0°C) into the cold air (below 0°C) below it freezes, forming freezing rain. This would line up with the METAR in the question. At location 3, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter. Location 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. Location 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties.",

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80. Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.

            "explanation": "Warm front clouds form a distinctive pattern as a warm front approaches. These clouds typically appear 800-1 000 km ahead of the surface position of the warm front. The sequence of cloud types you can observe starts with CI (cirrus clouds), then progresses to CS (cirrostratus), AS (altostratus), and finally NS (nimbostratus) along with low-level stratus clouds. Notably, the cloud base tends to lower as the warm front draws near. While it's rare, unstable warm fronts can occasionally feature CB (cumulonimbus) clouds, bringing associated hazards. Let's examine each option separately: \"In summer, the warm front is often accompanied by freezing rain or freezing drizzle close to the surface. In winter, the icing conditions close to the surface are less severe than in the summer, due to the lower moisture content of the air.\" Incorrect. In fact, winter is the season when warm fronts are more commonly associated with freezing rain or drizzle due to the lower temperatures. \"In summer, the warm fronts are in most cases accompanied with heavy showers of rain and severe thunderstorms, produced by embedded Ns clouds.\" Incorrect. While thunderstorms can occur with unstable warm fronts, they are usually not produced by embedded nimbostratus clouds (Ns). Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are more likely sources of thunderstorms in such cases. \"In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is smaller than in the summer, and therefore the average upper winds are weaker than in the summer.\" Incorrect. In winter, the temperature difference between the two air masses is typically greater, which can result in stronger upper-level winds compared to the summer.",

In contrast, the cold front slopes backward because the heavy, cold air forces itself underneath the warmer, lighter air. With a slope of between 1:50 and 1:80, the cold front is steeper than the warm front but still relatively gentle, causing stratiform clouds due to the gentle uplift.

Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the warmer air mass) are typically out of the southwest, but once the front passes through, winds usually shift around to the northwest (in the colder air mass). Temperature: steady before the front. A sudden decrease is usually observed at the front. Behind the cold front, it remains steady (cold). Pressure: before the front, it decreases slightly. At the front it starts to rise (after reaching its lowest value). A slow increase is observed behind the front. Clouds: At the cold front, BKN to OVC layers may occur with CU and CB. However, if the air is stable cold fronts can also produce nimbostratus clouds (and stratocumulus, and stratus clouds.) Precipitation: heavy rain or snow showers can be expected.

The North-West area of North Atlantic is a source of Polar Maritime air. (The biggest source for Western Europe) Siberia is a source of Polar Continental air. This is a huge source of air masses for much of the Northern Hemisphere. 2: A tropical continental air mass can be a cold air mass. CORRECT Air mass theory is more about where the air mass comes from and how it is altered before and as it reaches a location. So if a warmer air mass moves over a place that is colder, it’s comparatively a warm air mass. That doesn’t mean that if that area of air moved in another direction it would be a warm air mass for them too, it is all relative. So if a tropical air mass moved south over to a warmer area (an equatorial area would likely be hotter), then comparatively, the tropical air mass would be colder air than the base conditions at that location. There are 4 different adjectives we use for air masses, from coldest to warmest; Arctic, Polar, Tropical, Equatorial. Each can be continental (dry) or maritime (wet), and this depends on the source region and the track it has taken.",

When a cold air mass advects over a warmer surface (Polar air moving towards the tropics, for example), the lower layers of air are heated by the ground, which creates instability. It can be though of that the low level warm air wants to rise through the cold air, which is an unstable air mass. That is not exactly how it works, but is a good way to remember it. If air were to move from a warm source region to a colder area of surface, the warm air would be cooled from below, creating a stable air mass. It can be thought of like this; the cold air is more than happy to sit below a warmer air mass, so remains stable. Instability causes cumuliform clouds, which cause rain to fall as showers and storms, whereas stability tends to create stratiform clouds and fog, with rain falling lighter but more continuously. Cold Polar air moving over Australia is a cold air mass moving over a warmer surface, so will cause instability and showers.",

The denser cold air displaces/overtakes the less dense warm air => cold air will slide itself under the warm air, forcing it to rise. The slope of a cold front is approximately 1:50 to 1:80. Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Note: The warm front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to 2/3 of the geostrophic interval measured along the front.",

Yes, a warm occlusion will include a bit of cold front at altitude, but as it is a warm occlusion, the majority of it acts as a warm front. This leaves us with a fast-moving cold front and a slow-moving cold front. This is slightly counterintuitive, as one might think that a fast moving cold front is likely to be more \"aggressive\" than a slow-moving one, but it is actually the opposite. Meteorologists call slow-moving cold fronts \"active cold fronts\". This is because their slower movement means that the associated uplift is more gradual, and with a slightly shallower slope, gives rise to a much wider band of convective clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation and turbulence, going up the side of the front, which spreads the weather over a long distance. fast-moving cold fronts are referred to as \"inactive cold fronts\". This is a bit of a misnomer, as they still cause plenty of aggressive uplift, which leads to significant bands of thunderstorms and heavy convection in unstable atmospheric conditions, but the band of thunderstorms is much thinner, and remains ahead of the front (not up the sloped side of the front like slow-moving cold fronts). This is why the answer is that thunderstorms, CBs and convective clouds are more likely to be encountered at and around a slow-moving cold front.",

If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground, the droplets can become supercooled (which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0ºC). Ahead of the warm front where the freezing level in the cold air (approx. at 3500 ft in this case) is lower than the freezing level in the warm air above it (approx. at 5500 ft in this case) => As the rain falls from the warmer air (above 0°C) into the cold air (below 0°C) below it freezes => forming freezing rain. Nimbostratus clouds present in square \"3C\" will be mostly produce heavy and continuous rain => Therefore, below the frontal surface in square \"3C\" (and especially between 3 500 ft and 5 500 ft) => we will experience Freezing Rain (FZRA) Freezing rain/rain ice does not freeze immediately in the air but can impact the aerofoil to form clear ice or rime ice. Rain ice occurs in a narrow range of altitudes at low level ahead of a warm front (in this case, approaching square 3C from 3D) or occlusion and is associated particularly with the moderate continuous rain which often falls from nimbostratus cloud.",

            "explanation": "The figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. At point 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain (sometimes heavy rain) ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. At point 3, long since the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the Winter. This would line up with the METAR in the question. Point 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. Point 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties. The lack of rain/heavy rain and NOSIG (no significant changes expected in the next two hours) in the METAR rule out point 4, where rain/heavy rain is pretty much guaranteed, and changes are very much expected within the next 2 hours as the cloud lowers and the warm front passes.",

An occlusion usually takes on the form of both fronts in quick succession, and the weather in the central part of the occlusion will be decided by the type of occlusion, warm or cold. The type of occlusion is simply which front stays connected to the ground. If the warm front remains intact, and the cold front \"rides\" up it, then the warm front is still touching the ground, and it is a warm occlusion. The frontal weather acts more like a warm front in this case, and the majority of the rain occurs before the front hits, and the weather will gradually clear after the surface front has passed. On the other hand, if the cold front forces the warm front up, then the occlusion is a cold occlusion. This acts more like a cold front. Cold fronts are responsible for strong, severe storms. The weather tends to exhibit a dip in temperature prior to the storms and a drastic change in wind direction and speed. After the front passes, there is usually a rapid clearance in the weather. The type of occlusion depends on which sector of air is coldest. Of course, the warmest sector is forced upwards in between two colder sectors of air. If the back sector is coldest, then it will be a cold occlusion. If the front section is the coldest, then the back section will be comparatively warm, and a warm occlusion will form. In Europe, we usually see cold occlusions in Summer and warm occlusions in Winter (the opposite temperature of the season). This is because the winds into Western Europe are from the Atlantic and, in Summer, the ground is warmer than the water, so the front sector (which has already reached ground) is warmer than the back sector (still over water), and therefore a cold occlusion is most common.",

A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.

            "explanation": "This situation is quite complex to forecast, but there are some absolutes that we know. High pressure zones such as this anticyclone will give clear weather due to the subsidence of air, which will mean dry days and very cold nights during the winter (20th February). The ground will therefore be very cold after a few days of this. Water is not as affected by this, as it holds its heat much better, so will be warmer than the land. This cold land does make fog very likely in the mornings, namely radiation fog, which occurs when the land cools the lower layers of air until they reach their dewpoint, however, the question is not asking about the morning, instead about the afternoon and evening. This would no longer be affected by radiation fog, which will have been removed over most of the country by this point in the day due to solar insolation (there is not much solar insolation, during winter, but enough to remove the fog). There will still be some other fog, though, at the coasts where the wind is blowing from the sea. This is advection fog. Advection fog forms when warm, humid air, flows over a cold surface; in this case, the warmer, more humid sea air blowing over the colder land. The low level air then quickly cools to its dewpoint and forms fog. The wind is likely to be quite light at this point, but will likely be more than 5 kts from the Irish sea towards the coast of Wales (red arrows in annex above), which is just enough to form advection fog. Furthermore, we can see a cold front moving southwards nearby, so there must be some wind in that area. The other options require a lot of cloud, which would not occur in a high pressure zone like this (where air subsides), and the option stating \"radiation fog\" is a morning phenomenon, not one that would happen in the afternoon/evening, as explained above. Note: This question does require a little bit of geography knowledge, such as the location of Ireland and Wales. Similar knowledge of European geography is required in many questions, so is a good thing to learn, if not already known.

Winds - Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind. \"strong wind with subsidence at low levels\" INCORRECT. Trough is associated with ascending air at low levels. Subsidence is associated with High Pressure Systems and Ridges. \"strong wind associated with an almost clear sky\" INCORRECT. Extensive clouds can be expected under the influence of a Depression or Trough \"light wind, good visibility and a high cloud ceiling\" INCORRECT. Clouds may extend from low altitude to the tropopause, winds are usually strong.",

            ],
            "explanation": "See the comments - conflicting feedback. (1) Polar lows are formed over water only. CORRECT. Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours. Like their tropical cousins, polar lows tend to decay rapidly with landfall, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This is the reason that they do not occur naturally over land (see note below). (2) Thermal lows are formed over land only. INCORRECT. Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong. Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area. Thermal lows are most common over land masses but they can form over water when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season. Note: this question is very highly contested, and it seems that some authorities disagree on the correct answer. For instance the Polish and Hungarian authority believe that \"1 only\" is the wrong answer and we believe that they choose \"both correct\" as the correct answer, even though we have good feedback from other authorities that \"1 only\" correct. We say that the second most correct answer is \"none\", as there can be debate as to the formation of polar lows; where they usually form over water, could they occur completely over land? We have to go off the exam feedback, and so would appreciate any further feedback on this question in the comments, or sent to info@atplquestions.com.

Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Typical weather in an area under the influence of a High-Pressure is clear skies due to the sinking motion of air (subsidence), lighter winds than around a Depression and reduced chance of precipitation. Subsidence is, therefore, a sinking motion of air, present in the core of a High Pressure System. The subsidence, a sinking motion of air, is present in the core of a HIGH => the air gets compressed and adiabatically heated and stability increases.",

TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas. This release of heat causes the air to expand. This creates even stronger convergence, which in turn causes more moist air to rise and cool to condensation, aiding the release of greater amounts of latent heat Tropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions: Must be within 5 and 25 latitude (Below 5º, Coriolis force is too small, above 25º latitude the sea is usually too cold) Ocean temperatures must be greater than 26°C. The higher the ocean temperature the greater the pressure drop within the core => This is the reason why we do not usually have TRS forming in the southern Atlantic because the sea surface temperatures are too low.

An anticyclone is a region of relatively high pressure. Usually, the isobars of an anticyclone are more widely spaced than with depressions, and anticyclones move much slower, and can sometimes sit for weeks in a single location (called a blocking anticyclone). There are five types of anticyclone: warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges and blocking. Within an anticyclone, at high altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and divergence at the surface. Due to this subsiding air, there are very few clouds within the high pressure core, but anticyclones can often form inversions, and weather (stratus in winter, haze in summer) may become trapped underneath. CBs can form due to thermal uplift in the afternoon, but this is made more difficult by the subsiding air. Usual Anticyclonic Weather: > Summer Cloud: Very little to none. Occasional clouds towards the edges of the anticyclone. Precipitation: None. Visibility: Generally moderate with haze (often reducing with time as the haze becomes worse). Temperature: Dependent on type (Warm anticyclones bring warmer temperatures than cold ones). Often a large temperature difference between day and night. Winds: Light. > Winter Cloud: Extensive stratus with a low base and limited vertical extent. Precipitation: Possibly drizzle. Visibility: Generally moderate to poor with mist and fog likely. Temperature: Relatively warm. Winds: Light.",

One starts high pressure and gets higher with altitude (warm high), and the other starts high pressure and gets lower with altitude (cold high). Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW). Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights; they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate high pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate low pressure.",

            ],
            "explanation": "(1) Polar lows are formed over water only. CORRECT. Polar lows are defined as small but intense maritime meso-scale cyclones that form in cold polar or arctic air advected over relatively warmer water. Polar lows are much smaller and more transient than a regular mid-latitude depression. Their scale varies between 100 to 500 km and typically they last for anything between 12 to 36 hours. Like their tropical cousins, polar lows tend to decay rapidly with landfall, mostly due to the lack of warm moisture supply from the relatively warm sea. This may well be the reason that they do not occur naturally over land. (2) Thermal lows are mainly formed over land. CORRECT. Thermal lows or Heat lows are prominent climatological features of many arid land areas of the world during the warmer months, especially at low latitudes where insolation (solar heating) is strong. Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via re-radiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area. Thermal lows are most common over land masses but they can form over water when the sea temperature can become high enough to create a thermal low. This is particularly noticeable when the land temperatures in the region are much cooler, such as during the autumn season. Note: This is an offshoot question from Q501594 which has plenty of conflicting feedback. It appears that the UK CAA have decided to change option 2 to say \"mainly formed over land\", which is now correct. Any further exam feedback on this question can be placed in the comments here, and for the other question, search for 501594 and read the comments there, where there is more information. Thank you!",

These bring lots of poor weather due to convergence, similar to a region of low pressure, but usually with a little more intensity, and often quite a bit of wind shear Point E is a ridge of high pressure. These give nice weather (similar to a region of high pressure) due to subsidence and divergence. Point G is a region of high pressure (an anticyclone), similar to point E above, they bring wide regions of fair weather. Point N is not very well defined, but does appear to be a very small region of marginally higher pressure, which would likely fit the weather conditions in the surrounding region, perhaps slightly clearer.",

Some of the clues to figure this out are: The Wind; it will follow the isobars, so you can track its direction all the way around from the indication in the top left. This gives a clockwise flow around \"J\", which would make it a low pressure zone in the Southern Hemisphere (due to Buys Ballot's Law). The frontal activity centred close to \"J\". This looks like an occluded front with standard cold and warm fronts in a \"zipper\" pattern, and is indicative of a low pressure zone. \"G\" is a textbook looking blocking anticyclone with a high pressure ridge marked by \"E\". The surface wind is also pointing slightly away from \"G\" rather than following the isobars, proving again that \"G\" is high pressure. The layout of the isobars then show that \"J\" is therefore low pressure.",

Please send us any further exam feedback in the comments, on the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! A small-scale intense low pressure zone on route would be likely to bring very unsettled weather in that region. The inflow of air near the surface leads to air rising in the core of the low pressure region, and this brings large convective cloud formations, particularly in summer. This would be very likely to cause CBs and thunderstorms. Of course, these would be associated with heavy rainfall and turbulence, as well as icing, wind shear, hail, lightning, etc. As for visibility, low pressure zones like this tend to have good visibility outside of the clouds/precipitation as the mixing of air makes sure the particles causing bad visbility do not sit in a haze (as happens with high pressure). However, there is no option that says this, so for now we have to just assume they are talking about the very poor visibility in the clouds and precipitation (until we get any feedback that changes or verifies the options).",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights ⇒ in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature ⇒ Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

            "explanation": "LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM/DEPRESSION. Is an area which has a lower air pressure than the surroundings (the value of the isobars increase with distance from the centre). Isobars are closely spaced together. In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude. If the air is initially humid, this general lifting, in the centre of a depression, leads to condensation and formation of clouds. If the air is unstable, CB clouds may form. Even if the air is stable, clouds will form if the air is humid => leading to extensive stratiform cloud layers, Weather associated with Low Pressure Systems: - CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause - PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression. - VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air - TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air - WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.",

Such a region of slow moving air can prevent other, faster moving pressure systems from moving into a region. For this reason, they are known as Blocking Highs or BLOCKING ANTICYCLONES. The blocking anticyclone starts as a ridge of high pressure extending from a high pressure source region such as the sub-tropical Azores High (annex above) which breaks off and establishes itself as a separate anticyclone. Typically, found in the regions between 40ºN and 70ºN and may persist for several days giving (usually) warm dry weather in summer and stable, cold conditions in winter, mostly clear but with potential for light mist and drizzle. Blocking anticyclones can exist as both warm and cold (from Siberia or Greenland) anticyclones, but the strongest ones are theoretically warm anticyclones, as they maintain their higher pressure up to the tropopause, and are therefore longer lasting. The feedback for this question regularly shows this answer as being correct, but we believe it is wrong in assuming that it is a warm anticyclone.",

Any high or anticyclone that remains nearly stationary or moves slowly compared to the west to east motion upstream from its location, preventing the usual eastwards movement of frontal depressions and forcing these to take up northerly tracks (NH). These anticyclones are usually extensions of warm subtropical anticyclones, especially in summer, but can also be extensions of the siberian cold anticyclone in winter times. They can sometimes persist for weeks. Weather associated with blocking highs: Warm dry weather in summer and gloomy overcast conditions in winter with a possibility of drizzle. Over Europe in winter they may be extensions of the Siberian high giving (usually) cold clear conditions. \"2. Sea-breeze fronts ONLY occur in mid-latitudes.\" INCORRECT. Sea breeze is the flow of air from sea to land and can occur at any latitude.",

This gives a clockwise flow around \"J\", which would make it a low pressure zone in the Southern Hemisphere (due to Buys Ballot's Law). The frontal activity centred close to \"J\". This looks like an occluded front with standard cold and warm fronts in a \"zipper\" pattern, and is indicative of a low pressure zone. \"G\" is a textbook looking blocking anticyclone with a high pressure ridge marked by \"E\". The surface wind is also pointing slightly away from \"G\" rather than following the isobars, proving again that \"G\" is high pressure.

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kts, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas. Tropical revolving storms only form in certain conditions: Must be within 5 and 25 latitude (Below 5º, Coriolis force is too small, above 25º latitude the sea is usually too cold) Ocean temperatures must be greater than 26°C. The higher the ocean temperature the greater the pressure drop within the core => This is the reason why we do not usually have TRS forming in the southern Atlantic because the sea surface temperatures are too low. Sufficiently unstable atmosphere at low level (so convective clouds penetrate the Trade wind inversion). Direction of Movement After a Tropical Revolving Storm forms, they usually travel Westerly (from east to west), in the Northern Hemisphere. In the mature stage, they usually head to Northerly directions in the Northern Hemisphere. The storm, then, may re-curve at around 20°N or S => where it tracks Northeasterly (It must be noted though that recurvature may not take place).",

When they sustain wind speeds greater than 63 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones. TRS generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat from moisture they have gained over the warm seas. In the northern hemisphere (NH), conditions on the right-hand side of storms are more severe than those on their left-hand sides. For that reason, in the NH, Right-hand semicircle (RHSC) is called the “dangerous semicircle” and Left-hand semicircle (LHSC) is called the “navigable semicircle”. Dangerous semicircle— It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the right of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern Hemisphere (to the left in the Southern Hemisphere), where the storm has the strongest winds (The wind speed in the RHSC will be the sum of the cyclonic wind and the speed of the storm travel). Navigable semicircle — It is the side of a tropical cyclone, which lies to the left of the direction of movement of the storm in the Northern hemisphere (to the right in the Southern Hemisphere), where the winds are weaker and better for the navigation purpose, although all parts of TRS are more or less dangerous to mariners. SUMMARY: The fastest winds are found in the quadrant to the right of the storm track in the Northern Hemisphere and left of the track in the Southern Hemisphere.",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

            "explanation": "Let's break down the components of the statement: (1) Convergence: Convergence refers to the coming together or convergence of air masses. In the context of a trough, it indicates that air is flowing toward the trough axis from different directions and meeting at that point. (2) Lifting: Lifting refers to the upward movement of air. In the presence of convergence, the air is forced to rise along the trough axis. This lifting motion can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. (3) Cumuliform clouds or squalls: Cumuliform clouds are large, puffy clouds with a vertical development, often associated with convection. Squalls are intense, localized storms characterized by strong winds and heavy precipitation. Along the line of the trough, the convergence and lifting can result in the formation of cumuliform clouds or trigger squall-like weather conditions. Detailed explanation: A trough is an extension of a low-pressure system. It is an area indicated by isobars that extend outwards from an area of low Pressure (typically forming a “V” shaped pattern). Troughs are very often associated with the fronts of polar front depressions. The weather associated with a trough will be similar to that of a depression. Weather associated with a Trough: CLOUD: extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause PRECIPITATION: may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression. VISIBILITY: Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air. TEMPERATURE: dependent on type of depression and time of year. For example, a frontal depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, but in summer will bring cooler air. WINDS: Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, the stronger the wind.",

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

Tropical revolving storms always form in a Westwards direction, due to the NE and SE trade winds which form them. They always form at least 5º North or South of the Equator, and turn away from the Equator initially. Their tracks are always very difficult to forecast. As seen in the annex above, Cyclones in the South Indian Ocean (that is what Tropical Revolving Storms are called in that region) start Westwards/South-Westwards and turn gradually more to the South. They can continue round to South-Eastwards, but usually get over colder water by this point and begin to die down.",

These anticyclones are usually extensions of warm subtropical anticyclones, especially in summer, but can also be extensions of the siberian cold anticyclone in winter times. They can sometimes persist for weeks. Weather associated with blocking highs: warm dry weather in summer and gloomy overcast conditions in winter with a possibility of drizzle. Over Europe in winter they may be extensions of the Siberian high giving (usually) cold clear conditions. \"2. Sea-breeze fronts can occur in mid-latitudes and the tropics.\" CORRECT.

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures. => Therefore, low pressure at the surface - isobaric surfaces bulge downwards at the surface; high pressure in the upper air - isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in the upper air.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud.

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Under the Köppen climate classification system, the five main climate groups are A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar). In this system, each area of the world is given a 3-letter description (sometimes 2-letter description) of the climate, with this climate group as the first letter, followed by the seasonal rainfall descriptor, then a temperature descriptor. For this question, we can assume that equatorial means A - tropical climate, as this is most apt. The tropical climate exists around the equator, and has rain almost every day, sometimes all year round. (some places have dry seasons, occasionally twice a year.). Out of the 4 options for part 1, only the Congo Delta and the Brazilian rainforest are in tropical (equatorial) climate zones; the Kalahari Desert is dry, as is Mali in the Sahara Desert. For part 2, we are looking for temperate zones, which covers quite an array of temperatures, hot/cold summers, hot/cold winters, etc. all having separate climate letters. Temperate climate can be expected in South-Eastern states of the USA, most of Western Europe, a large area of SE China, SE Australia and New Zealand. They commonly have distinct seasons and good climates for growing many types of crops. Of the 4 options, only the New Zealand option is correct, as even the Northern Territories of Australia are on the colder end of the tropical climate regions.",

When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upsind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent.

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days. Note: The 2016 syllabus referred to these are \"cold pools\", but the new syllabus refers to them as \"cold-air drops\". They are the same so any explanations are interchangeable.",

            "explanation": "MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

            "explanation": "COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure - They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (on the upwind side of the mountain), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

However, when averaged over many years a global pattern of air movement emerges. The reason we have different weather patterns is all because of the global atmospheric circulation caused by the rotation of the Earth and the amount of heat different parts of the globe receive. The sun is our main source of heat, and because of the tilt of the Earth, its curvature, our atmosphere, clouds and polar ice and snow, different parts of the world heat up differently. The change in angle leads to stronger insolation on the Northern Hemisphere from April to September, and stronger insolation on the Southern Hemisphere from October to March. Thus, different pressure areas which trigger a large circulation between the equator and the poles are formed. Because of the Earth´s rotation, a direct flow between anticyclone (equator) and depression (poles) is prevented. In the Northern hemisphere, the air masses are deflected to the right and in the Southern hemisphere to the left. For that reason, three large circulation cells are generated (Hadley cell, Ferrel cell and the Polar cell).",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

It moves North in the Northern Hemisphere Summer and South in the Northern Hemisphere Winter. Therefore, the ITCZ is responsible for the wet and dry seasons in the tropics. The sun crosses the equator twice a year in March and September, and consequently makes for two wet seasons each year. In December and July, when the sun is at its greatest extent north or south of the equator makes for two dry seasons. Further away from the equator, the two wet seasons merge into one, and the climate becomes more monsoonal, with one wet season and one dry season. In the Northern Hemisphere the wet season occurs from May to July, in the Southern Hemisphere from November to February. As the ITCZ moves due to the seasons, it is therefore based on the Earth's position in orbit of the Sun. Note: The ITCZ is subject to large seasonal movement overland, but much less over the sea.",

            "explanation": "COLD AIR DROP A cold air drop (cold pool) is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold air drops (cold pools) are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold air pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region. When they are present, there is a huge amount of cold air sat on top of a much warmer (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere. This means that there is a very high environmental lapse rate, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and this causes layers of massive instability. The large instability can cause heavy convective activity, including cumulonimbus clouds if the low level air is moist enough, meaning that they can be quite dangerous for aviation.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

In the Northern Hemisphere the westerlies apply mainly over the oceans, with frequent winter gales. During the summer months these westerlies are less constant and less strong. In the Southern Hemisphere these winds are largely uninterrupted by land masses and are consequently strong. They are called The Roaring Forties - so called because they blow principally between latitudes of 40° and 50° S. Weather in this belt comes from rapidly moving depressions: wild weather, strong westerly winds and gales, overcast skies and heavy rain.",

Further information: MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of India, the SW monsoon brings humid maritime air from the Indian Ocean. It hits the West coast of India directly, but does still affect the Eastern edge of India, as the heat of the Indian landmass effectively \"pulls in\" the air from the Bay of Bengal to the East, so on the Eastern side of India, the wind is more Southerly than South-Westerly. During the Winter months (December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the cooler air from the Siberian peninsula flows over the Indian subcontinent from the NE, called the NE monsoon. It is much drier and cooler than the SW monsoon.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. => One such wind is the Chinook which blows on the eastern side of the Rocky mountains in Canada - usually blows during the winter months and produces a rapid and considerable rise in temperature. How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold air pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected.

Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure - They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. => The weather activity within a cold pool is usually greatest in the afternoon, due to radiation and consequent warming of ground surfaces If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

Where the temperature increases with an increase in height, then we have what is called an inversion: vertical mixing is inhibited and below an inversion the wind speed will be light with a significantly different direction to the much stronger wind above the inversion. Hence windshear will occur at the inversion. An aircraft climbing or descending through the inversion will experience a rapid change in speed and direction giving, possibly, moderate to severe turbulence.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

Usually, these questions ask about the seasonal monsoon in India, but the layout of China, and particularly the location of Hong Kong on the South coast of China, create quite similar weather patterns. In summer, the ITCZ travels far North (with the Sun) into the large landmass of China, up as far as the Siberian Peninsula, and the ITCZ is a low pressure zone, so the air around it is drawn towards it. This means that the warm, moist air from the South China Sea is drawn up towards the land to the North. This wind is therefore from the South-West, causing very wet, humid weather, with lots of rainfall and occasional violent storms. In the winter, the winds are the opposite, due to the ITCZ travelling South to follow the Sun. The ITCZ now sits in the region of the South China Sea, and draws air from the landmass of China. This means that the air flowing over Hong Kong at the coast is much dryer, cooler air, which has travelled a long way over cooler land, before going out to see. This wind is from the North-East, and the conditions are dry.",

            "explanation": "COLD AIR DROP/COLD POOL A cold pool is a low pressure system, that only exists in the upper troposhere - it’s a cooler-than-normal pocket of air in the higher levels of the atmosphere. As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.",

            "explanation": "\"1. The summer monsoon in the southern part of India is a NE monsoon\" Incorrect. Monsoon winds are caused by high and low-pressure zones which develop over large continents. They are particularly marked in South and Southeast Asia and also occur in West Africa. Weather will depend very much on the track followed. NE monsoons over central India will be dry with little cloud, whilst the SW monsoons will be warm and moist with much convective cloud and heavy rain. During the summer season (July), the average ITCZ position relative to India is approximately 23°N, resulting in SW trade winds prevailing (SW Monsoon). In the winter, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. \"2. The prevailing climatic zone in Australia is the dry climate\" Correct. Regions with dry climates are primarily situated along the subtropical high zones. The proportion of these areas in the Southern Hemisphere is much smaller than in the Northern Hemisphere. It's important to note that the Northern part of Australia falls under the tropical rain climate, and most of Australia's coasts have a mild temperate climate.",

The Mistral is a valley wind that flows down through the Rhône Valley in the French Alps. When high pressure forms in the Bay of Biscay, and low pressure in the Gulf of Genoa, the wind lines up roughly with the valleys of Southern France, which will channel the air, and use the Venturi effect (amongst other effects) to increase the wind speed, and change the direction of the air to flow along the valley, towards the Mediterranean Sea. It is usually a cold wind, and usually occurs in dry weather, giving clear skies and of course, strong winds. Note: This question simply wants us to know that the Mistral is a valley wind. The current feedback says that the correct answer is, \"Strong surface winds blowing across a river valley.\". We believe that \"along\" a river valley would be more correct, but given the other options, this is still by far the most correct answer.

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement.

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. During the SW Monsoon, which occurs in the summer months of June, July, and August, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts northward, away from the Equator. As the Southeast trade winds cross the equator, they change direction to the southwest, giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This monsoon follows a lengthy sea track, gathering moisture along the way. It results in the formation of dense Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds, leading to intense thunderstorms, low cloud bases, and severe turbulence. The impact on aviation is more significant compared to the NE Monsoon. The SW Monsoon has widespread effects, affecting regions such as India, Sri Lanka, Burma, the exposed coasts of West Malaysia, and the West African coast (including Guinea, Ghana, and North Nigeria). The accompanying annex illustrates the influence of the West African SW monsoon on countries north of the Gulf of Guinea. The Cumulonimbus clouds are depicted reaching FL480, indicating the substantial vertical extent of the weather system.",

Here, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere. As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. these convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear. The ITCZ is a low pressure zone, due to the intense heating of the local air from the hot ground/sea, leading to large updrafts of air, which can form very violent thunderstorms, climbing to altitudes of 55-60 000 ft at their highest. Therefore, it can be very dangerous to fly in the region of the ITCZ. Mostly, this is due to rapidly changing, unpredictable, violent weather conditions. For this question though, that is not part of any of the options. Instead, this question is asking about the dangers of the ITCZ in terms of it being a low pressure area. A low pressure area can cause altimeters to overread if they are not set correctly. This sounds self-explanatory (\"Of course they don't work if you don't use them right!\"), but actually, it can lead to the aircraft being much lower than expected, either during times of rapid pressure changes, or when the aircraft is flying on flight levels, and therefore using 1013 hPa. In hot and low pressure areas, the aircraft's true altitude could be many thousands of feet below what is showing on the altimeter (pressure altitude). This is particularly dangerous around mountains, which this question mentions.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.08.03.04.03: Identify cold-air drops on weather charts. A cold-air drop is a mass of cold polar air which becomes separated from the other polar air by transiting towards the warmer air in the subtropical region. This can take a few different forms, but the most usual form is that the air between 10-30,000ft is much colder in one patch (sometimes called a cold-air pool), than the sub-tropical air around it. This cold air means that the column of air in that region is much shorter than around it, as pressure drops off more quickly with increasing height in a cold air mass. The cold air becomes trapped, and usually forms a circle. This does form a low pressure zone higher up in the troposphere, which can be seen on medium and high level pressure charts. It also forms a region where there is a huge amount of cold air sat on top of warm (and moist also if over water) lower section of troposphere. This means that there is a very high environmental lapse rate, the warm air wants to rise and the cold air wants to sink, and this causes layers of massive instability. It can often only be seen by comparing pressure charts for different levels to see the change in pressure due to the thermal effect, but not by looking only at the surface pressure, where it may not be visible. The later stages of a cold-air drop usually ends up as a low pressure zone at the ground also, but this is not examined by EASA. The higher pressure chart should show an area of lower pressure that does not exist on the surface (or lower altitude) chart. This means that the thermal effect has taken place, and that the area has cold air in it. In this case, there are two possible diagrams which show a resemblance to this. Figure A and Figure D both show more low pressure on the 700 hPa charts that the surface charts. The difference between them is the size of the cold-air drop. Figure A shows lower pressure over the whole region of the image (which is in comparison to the area outside the image), meaning that the potential cold-air drop which has caused it would be very large. Figure D, however, shows a smaller, isolated cold-air drop (low pressure zone) in the middle of the 700 hPa chart, which did not appear on the surface chart which showed a neutral \"col\" pressure distribution. 700 hPa is approximately equivalent to 10,000ft, so the thermal effect has not had too much time to take effect, but at higher levels, the cold-air drop would be even more visible on the charts. Note: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. We have had enough feedback and a reply to an appeal from the Hungarian CAA that Figure A is correct, however we think figure D is also a possible cold air drop, and our initial feedback also supported that. See the comments for the most recent feedback, and keep putting exam feedback in the comments when possible, thank you!",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

These winds become increasingly unstable as they travel over progressively warmer surfaces. This instability is further amplified when the winds pick up moisture from the ocean and are subsequently uplifted by landmasses. The ITCZ predominantly influences the equatorial region and shifts away from the Equator over land due to the land heating up more rapidly than the sea. For example, to the west of southern Africa and South America, the ITCZ does not extend into the Southern Hemisphere. This is because of the very cold sea currents that pass northwards along these coastlines. Cold water prevents the ITCZ from moving south. Cold ocean currents stabilize the atmosphere, which restricts the movement of the ITCZ.",

As a parcel of air at the surface warms up during the day - it wants to rise. This happens because warmer air is less dense/more buoyant than the cooler air around it. As it rises, the parcel of air cools off. However, when a \"cold pool aloft\" exists, the parcel that began rising from the surface wants to continue rising through the cold pool. Even though the parcel was cooling as it was rising, it still remains relatively warmer than the cold pool and wants to continue its upward journey. With these air parcels being allowed to continue rising, it induces more cloud development and rain/thunderstorm potential. This is why cold pools aloft are often associated with deep instability and the severe weather associated with vigorous convection is possible. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challange for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypse) height on the 500hPa chart and higher and the surface chart may show high pressure.

            "explanation": "Note: We have changed this question to ask now about the formation of convective clouds within the ITCZ, and no longer just about the formation of the ITCZ. This is by far the more reported version, but please do let us know in the comments if you see a question that does NOT mention \"convective clouds\", but is similar to this question, thank you. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a broad zone of air mass sometimes called the heat equator. Here, the prevailing trade winds of the North and South Hemispheres collide. Due to intense solar heating near the equator of both the land and the oceans, the warm, moist air is forced up into the atmosphere. As the air rises, it cools, causing persistent bands of showers and storms around the Earth’s midsection. These convective storms are known to produce intense rainfall, severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, lightning and windshear. The air mass then flows outwards (both North and South), and finally subsides in the subtropical high pressure zones (between 30° - 40°N), also called the \"horse latitudes\", where the air moves downward toward Earth’s surface, forming a high pressure surface region with clear, warm weather. The subtropical highs then cause the trade winds, completing the cycle within the Hadley cell of the atmosphere. Storms within the ITCZ will often go as high as 50 - 60 000 ft, so cannot be escaped upwards by commercial jet aircraft, and must be avoided using lateral deviations. For this question then, the convergence of the trade winds greatly affects the formation of convective clouds in the ITCZ. The warm oceans also play a large part in how much humidity is available to form these convective clouds; the greater the humidity, the more intense the clouds and storms. The Easterly jet stream, also known as the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), is a significant feature in the tropical regions, especially during the summer months. It is characterized by strong easterly winds, blowing from east to west at high level. It is not technically classed as a jet stream in the usual sense, but is commonly referred to as such. It is formed when the ITCZ is significantly moved away from the equator, but will likely have a corresponding effect on the future ITCZ formation. It is a product of the ITCZ but has little to no effect on the convective clouds within the ITCZ.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. With regards to this question, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds. The north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer. Therefore, temperature is higher north of the Alps than south of the Alps at the same altitude.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm.",

For our syllabus, India has two primary seasons with transitional times between the two, explained by the SW and NE monsoons. A monsoon is a seasonal wind, and India experiences 2 monsoons during the year, The one in this question is the SW monsoon that blows during the summer (June - September), when the ITCZ is quite far Northwards, into and North of India and up to as far as the Siberian Peninsula. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure due to the intense heating, and therefore the surface wind flows towards it. This pulls warm water out of the Indian Ocean, turning into humid, unstable air masses over the hot Indian land mass, and can form into some very large and violent thunderstorms across India. These bring huge amounts of rainfall, and hence, the SW monsoon season is very much classed as the rainy season. The NE monsoon occurs at the opposite time of year, from December to February, when the ITCZ has gone to the South, now firmly within the Indian Ocean. This low pressure surface zone attracts the wind from all directions, meaning that much cooler, drier air flows over India from the North and North-East, then out towards the Indian Ocean. If you can picture the movement of the ITCZ throughout the year and know that air flowing from ocean to land brings rain, these questions become simple, and the Indian monsoon seasons are easy to work out every time. Of course the answer here is the SW monsoon, and the months that best fit it are July to August.",

At some point, they become detached from the cold Polar air and become a “cold pool” of air in the upper troposphere that has quite an effect on the weather in that region, due to the instability they bring. CHARACTERISTICS Cold pools are a challenge for the weather forecast, because the numerical weather prediction models cannot predict the exact direction of movement. Would be indicated by the low contour (isohypses) height on the 300hPa and 500hPa charts, whereas the surface charts and 800 hPa charts may show no sign of any such low pressure region (it exists only above these altitudes, often around 10 000 to 30 000 ft). They cannot be detected on surface analysis charts. The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in summer when thunderstorms can be expected. If associated with a static high pressure area such as the Siberian High, a cold pool could be present for weeks. But, in the area of the polar front, the weather systems usually move from West to East in a series of waves and, like the polar front depressions, their duration will be only a few days. => On average cold pools persists for approximately 3 days.

Note: This question is similar to 504956 - with some different options in more recent feedback. If future feedback shows they are the same question completely, they will be merged. This question is really tricky because of its options. The correct answer is the South-West Monsoon to our knowledge, as this is the standard name for that monsoon in the syllabus, however, that is the monsoon that occurs during Summer. Therefore, it is just a case of knowing the correct name of it in the syllabus. This is made even worse by the fact they mention the South-Easterly trade winds, which could confuse you further. We could use some extra feedback to confirm the wording on this question also, thank you. So for starters, by the question saying that the South-Easterly trade winds are blowing over India, it means that the ITCZ has travelled to the North of India, and therefore it is Northern Hemisphere Summer. The trade-winds actually stop blowing from the SE when they cross over to the Northern Hemisphere, and the Coriolis force (still quite weak near the Equator) begins to turn them to the right instead, so they actually arrive at India from the South-West. They do not change name though, we still call them the South-East trade winds as that's what they were originally, when they were in the Southern Hemisphere. The monsoon is the seasonal change in the wind in India. In the Winter, the NE Monsoon blows from the dry plains of the Siberian Peninsula, and in the Summer, the ITCZ goes North of India and the SW Monsoon takes over, the wind now coming from the hot, humid air from over the Indian Ocean, bringing very wet, often stormy weather.",

            "explanation": "During the summer months (June, July, August), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) tends to shift away from the Equator and move further northward. As a result, the SE trade winds originating from the Southern Hemisphere undergo a change in direction as they cross the geographic Equator and enter the Northern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite to the left deflection in the Southern Hemisphere), causing them to become SW monsoons. This phenomenon is observed in various regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In the context of India, these SW monsoons bring humid maritime air. Conversely, during the winter months (December, January, February), the ITCZ tends to move further south, particularly over land areas. As a result, the NE trade winds from the Northern Hemisphere need to cross the geographic Equator to reach the ITCZ. Upon entering the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the left, resulting in a change in their direction from NE to NW. Consequently, the Southern Hemisphere experiences NW monsoons, particularly in southern parts of Africa, while the Northern Hemisphere encounters NE monsoons in regions that previously experienced SW monsoons during the summer months (such as parts of Africa and India). Using India as an example, these NE monsoons bring dry continental air.",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain, it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peaks and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions.",

Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria). => As a sum up, NE monsoons will be dry with little cloud. SW monsoon with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet condition and convective clouds and will be warm. As we have seen above, the SW Monsoon occurs between June and August and the NE Monsoon occurs between December and February => the transition between these two occurs between September and November.",
