In the Trim Sheet (Part B), the DOI is given, all the masses of the baggage compartments 1 and 4 are transferred and the number of passengers are given, too. So, follow through the grids moving in the direction of the arrows for the correct number of divisions, ignoring the fuel index, as The scale is marked on each grid. Once the line reaches the CG envelope, drop straight down until it crosses the ZFM, 46 130 kg. So, the Centre of Gravity in %MAC can be read as 17.8%.",

The bottom left block of the load sheet is used to calculate zero fuel mass, take-off mass, and landing mass, while the top part is used for determining the underload. Zero fuel mass is obtained by adding the dry operating mass and total traffic load. Assuming the correct input values of 39 000 kg for dry operating mass and 5 000 kg for traffic load, the zero fuel mass is correctly calculated as 44 000 kg. The landing mass is calculated by subtracting the trip fuel from the take-off mass. However, both the take-off mass and the trip fuel value entered in the lower section are incorrect (trip fuel is mistakenly entered as take-off fuel), leading to an incorrect landing mass calculation. Take-off mass is determined by adding take-off fuel to the zero fuel mass. The load sheet indicates a take-off fuel value of 10 500 kg in the upper section, but mistakenly, the trip fuel mass of 7 500 kg has been entered in the bottom section. As a result, the calculation for take-off mass is incorrect. To find the underload, three steps are involved. Firstly, the maximum values for zero fuel mass, take-off mass, and landing mass are determined and correctly entered in the top section of the load sheet. Next, the most limiting maximum mass (identified as the \"lowest of a, b, c\" on the load sheet) should be selected. In this case, the zero fuel mass should have been chosen. However, the highest limit, the take-off mass, was used instead, resulting in an erroneous underload calculation.",

Moment is the turning force created by the mass over a distance or lever arm: Moment = Mass x Arm Remember that, by convention, the items aft of the datum have a positive arm, and consequently a positive moment, and those which are forward of the datum have a negative arm and moment. Thus, since the nose landing gear jack point is forward of the datum (main landing gears jack points), both its arm and moment will be negative. Generally, the Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing by the total mass: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass. The Total mass of the aircraft is: 4 350 kg + (2 x 15 005 kg) = 34 360 kg and its Total Moment: [4 350 kg x (-12.2 m)] + [(2 x 15 005 kg) x 0] = - 53 070 kg.m. Therefore, the CG position of the BEM will be: - 53 070 kg.m / 34 360 kg = -1.54 m. The minus (-) symbol implies that the CG position is 1.54 m forward of the main landing gears.",

Formula to be used: New Total Moment = Old Total Moment - Moment of Load Removal Moment = mass × arm CG = total moment ÷ total mass load = mass of load removal The new total moment can be calculated by multiplying the new mass by the new CG. We know the new CG (86) but we do not know the new mass, therefore we replace the new mass by subtracting a variable (our load removal) from the old mass: “4 000 - load”. New total moment = (4 000 - load) × 86 Old total moment = 4 000 × 85 The moment of the load removal is also unknown but we know the arm (22.5), therefore we can find the result by multiplying the variable with a value of 22.5: load × 22.5 The variable called “load” is the same which we used above, because the mass of the load removal will also reduce the total mass by the same value. New Total Moment = Old Total Moment – Moment of Load (4 000 - load) × 86 = 4 000 x 85 – load x 22.5 344 000 - 86 load = 340 000 – 22.5 load 63.5 load = 4 000 Load = 63 lb",

Therefore, the CG position of the BEM will be: - 22 570 kg.m / 18 130 kg = -1.24 m. The minus (-) symbol implies that the CG position is 1.24 m forward of the main landing gears.",

Current Situation: The AFT CG limit is 139 inches aft of the datum. However, due to the current arrangement of passengers, the CG exceeds the AFT CG limits by 3 inches (making the current CG at 142 inches aft of the datum). How may we bring the CG Forward by 3 inches to meet the CG aft limit without re-arranging the passengers? We will use an extra ballast (mass) forward of the aircraft (front seats) to bring the CG to the aft limit. How much Extra Ballast? CG is 3'' behind the aft limit. Therefore, the CG is 142'' aft of datum. Old Total moment = 2530 x 142 lb.in To bring the CG forward to within limits, a ballast (\"m\") must be added to the front seat. The front seat is located at 65'' aft of datum. Ballast moment = m x 65 lb.in The New Total Mass will be: New total mass = 2530 + m This will result in a New Total Moment: New Total Moment = (2530 + m) x 139 lb.in Now apply the formula: Old Total Moment + Moment of the ballast = New Total Moment 2530 x 142 + m x 65 = (2530 + m) x 139 2530 x 142 + m x 65 = 2530 x 139 + m x 139 m = 102.6 lb = 103 lb Alternatively, simply apply the following formula: New mass x New CG = (Old mass x Old CG) ± (mass x arm) (2530 + m) x 139 = (2530 x 142) + (65 x m) 351 670 + 139 m = 359 260 + 65 m 74 m = 7590 M = 102.6 lb ≈ 103 lb",

The location of the CG determines the aircraft's stability and maneuverability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. According to the figure, the CG of the aircraft are in the following positions: Aircraft A: CG located at 12.8% MAC. Aircraft B: CG located at 9.3% MAC. Aircraft C: CG located at 23% MAC. Aircraft D: CG located at 20% MAC. The CG of aircraft B is located closer to the aircraft nose (closer to the forward CG limit) than the rest of the aircraft.

Distance from Mass to New CG: 280 in – 204.8 in => 75.2 in Change of CG = (1 670.21 x 75.2 in) / 62 800 kg = 2 in (3) “Move 483,07 kg from forward cargo hold 20 inches aft of datum to the aft cargo hold 280 inches aft of datum” Mass Change / Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance Moved Mass Change: 483.07 kg Total Mass: 62 800 kg Change of CG: ?

            "explanation": "For the swept wing aircraft, it is more convenient, for aerodynamic purposes, to relate the CG position to the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) of a wing. In this case the CG is expressed as a percentage of its position along the MAC (%MAC) from the leading edge (LEMAC). For this question: 30% MAC means that the CG is 30% along the MAC length (4.60 m), which corresponds to: 4.60 m x 0.3 = 1.38 m aft from the LEMAC. So, its initial CG position is: 14 m + 1.38 m = 15.38 m aft from the reference datum. 33% MAC means that the CG is 33% along the MAC length (4.60 m), which corresponds to: 4.60 m x 0.33 = 1.518 m aft from the LEMAC. So, its CG re-position will be: 14 m + 1.518 m = 15.518 m aft from the reference datum. So, the CG change is: 15.518 m - 15.38 m = 0.138 m, which means that after the new cargo load distribution, the CG moves more aft, because portion of the front cargo is transferred to the rear cargo compartment. The amount of mass which is transferred to the rear cargo compartment can be found applying the \"Shifting Load\" formula: Mass Change / Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance Moved. Solving for Mass Change, we get: Mass Change = Change of CG x Total Mass / Distance Moved = 0.138 m x 200 000 kg / (25 m -15 m) = 2 760 kg. Therefore, the new distribution load will be: Front Cargo: 6 500 kg - 2 760 kg = 3 740 kg. Rear Cargo: 4 000 kg + 2 760 kg = 6 760 kg.",

Moment is the turning force created by the mass over a distance or lever arm: Moment = Mass x Arm Remember that, by convention, the items aft of the datum have a positive arm, and consequently a positive moment, and those which are forward of the datum have a negative arm and moment. Thus, since the nose landing gear jack point is forward of the datum (main landing gears jack points), both its arm and moment will be negative. Generally, the Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing by the total mass: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass. The Total mass of the aircraft is: 4350 kg + (2 x 15 505 kg) = 35 360 kg and its Total Moment: [4350 kg x (-12.2 m)] + [(2 x 15 505 kg) x 0] = - 53 070 kg.m.

The following formula helps to find out how much the Box Z must be moved so as to establish the new CG position: Mass Change / Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance Moved. Solving for Distance Moved we get: Distance Moved = (Change of CG x Total Mass) / Mass Change= (18 in. x 48700 lb) / 880 lb = 996 in.

To achieve balance, the following should apply: Moment1 = Moment2 ⇒ 1 kg x distance1 = 2 kg x distance2 (1) The total length of the plan is 3 m, so distance1 + distance2 = 3 m. This means that distance2 = 3 m - distance1 (2) If we combine relationships (1) and (2), the following applies: 1 kg x distance1 = 2 kg x (3 m - distance1) distance1 = 2 x 3 - 2 x distance1 3 x distance1 = 2 x 3 distance1 = 2 m This means that the mass of 1 kg should have a distance of 2 m from the pivot point, and the mass of 2 kg should have a distance of 3 m - 2 m = 1 m from the pivot. The initial distance between the pivot and the mass of 2 kg is 3 / 2 = 1.5 m, so the plank has to move by 1.5 m - 1 m = 0.5 m towards the 1 kg mass.

The Load/Trim sheet is divided in two parts: Part A (to the left) is a loading summary. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. Landing Mass is the Take-off Mass of the aircraft less the trip fuel and can be calculated in the order indicated in Section 3 of the Part A (left side) of the Load/Trim sheet, as Thus, the Landing Mass is: Total Traffic Load + Dry Operating Mass + Take-off fuel - Trip fuel = 11 230 kg + 34 900 kg + 9 500 kg - 6 500 kg = 49 130 kg. Since the question asks for the Centre of Gravity at landing, the fuel index used, will be that for the Landing Fuel. The Landing Fuel is: Take-off fuel - Trip fuel = 9 500 kg - 6 500 kg = 3 000 kg, thus the fuel index used will be -4.3. In the Trim Sheet (Part B), the DOI is given, all the masses of the baggage compartments 1 and 4 are transferred, the number of passengers are given too and the fuel index for the landing mass is -4.3. So, follow through the grids moving in the direction of the arrows for the correct number of divisions, as The scale is marked on each grid. Once the line reaches the CG envelope, drop straight down until it crosses the Landing Mass, 49 130 kg. So, the Centre of Gravity in %MAC at landing can be read as 19%.",

For large aircraft, it is convenient to use an index to represent the large numbers involved and to simplify the calculations. Dry Operating Index (DOI) is the index for the position of the CG at the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). For this question, according to the figure, the DOI is given by the formula: I = [(CG - 25) x W x 0.029] + 100, where CG is in %MAC and W in 1000 kg. So, the DOI is: [(31.6 - 25) x 110.8 x 0.029] + 100 = 121.2. The correction on DOI for the additional flight crew member of 85 kg in zone E is: -0.98 x 85 kg/100kg = - 0.8.

NOTE: Do not attempt to multiply the total mass with the CG (7730 kg x 4.53 m) to get the correct total moment, because both CG and moments are rounded and you will not get the desired result.",

Remember the formula for CG calculation: CG = Total Moment ÷ Total Mass Where Total Moment = Total Mass x CG. To determine the mass, we'll use a simple equation. By calculating the total moment in the current configuration and subtracting the moment of the load removal, we can ascertain the new total moment. Given the provided data - old and new CG, station of load removal, and total mass, we may find the mass \"m\" of the load removal: New Total Moment = Old Total Moment - Load Removal (112 000 - m) × 20 = 112 000 × 22.62 - m × 30 112 000 × 20 - m × 20 = 112 000 × 22.62 - m × 30 2 240 000 - m × 20 = 2 533 440 - m × 30 -m × 20 = 293 440 - m × 30 m × 10 = 293 440 m = 29 344 kg Alternatively, for a more straightforward approach, you may use the following formula: Change in Mass / Old Total Mass = Change in CG / Distance from mass to new CG Change in Mass = (Change in CG / distance from mass to new CG) x Old total mass Change in Mass = (2.62 / 10) x 112,000 Change in Mass = 29 344 kg",

More lift means more drag, more drag means higher fuel consumption, range and endurance decrease, but longitudinal static stability increases. For an aft CG position, the opposite effects are true. Better fuel consumption is achieved, range and endurance increases, but longitudinal static stability decreases. The aft limit is usually just in front of the wing’s Centre of Pressure and the optimum centre of gravity position is near the aft limit. Most modern aircraft use automatic fuel management to ensure that the CG remains at the optimum aft position in flight for range flying and best fuel economy. Tanks are generally located in the wings (outer and inner) and in a central position in the fuselage, but may also be found in the fin and the horizontal stabiliser. Fuel is fed from the tanks in the correct sequence to maintain wing bending relief and aft CG position. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and stabiliser (trim tanks) have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons. Firstly, to provide extra fuel capacity and range and secondly, to help maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum aft position.",

The same procedure also applies to all the remaining cargos and all passenger section loading. The last row is designed to adjust the fuel load effect on the centre of gravity. In this case, we are looking for the zero fuel mass CG. Therefore, we can simply track vertically down through the fuel index tape and continue down into the graph. Draw a horizontal line at the zero fuel mass of 137 875 kg. The point of intersection of both lines will corresponds to the zero fuel mass CG: it lies in between lines “31” and “32”, which gives the ZFM centre of gravity position of approx. 31 % of the MAC.

Solving for \"Distance from mass to new CG\" we get: Distance from mass to new CG = Change of CG x Old total mass / Mass change = 2.5 in. x 12 400 kg / 150 kg = 206.6 in. Since each seat pitch is 33 in, then the two passengers must move from the rear seat row to bring the CG on to the aft limit at least by: 206.6 in. / 33 in. = 6.26 rows.

Moment = Mass × Balance Arm The moment is used to determine the torque created by the mass at a specific distance. Knowing the moments of various components (passengers, cargo, fuel) allows for the calculation of the overall center of gravity of the aircraft. In modern aircraft, digital systems can automate the process of caclulating the CG These systems include sensors that provide real-time data on weights and their locations, and computers that execute the moment calculations for all loaded components of the aircraft and then divide by the total weight of the aircraft to find the CG position.

Solving for Mass change we get: Mass Change = (Change of CG x Total Mass) / Total Distance Moved = (0.322 x 190000 kg) / (20.98 m - 3.5 m) = 3500 kg. CG displacement from 38% MAC TO 31% MAC means that it must be displaced forward, therefore the shifting load 3500 kg must be added to the Cargo 1 (forward cargo) and at the same time the same amount must be removed from Cargo 4 (aft cargo). After the cargo load redistribution, the Cargo 1 will weigh: 3000 kg + 3500 kg = 6500 kg and the Cargo 4 will weigh: 7000 kg - 3500 kg = 3500 kg.",

            "explanation": "Floor loads and aircraft weights are occasionally given in Newtons (N). A Newton is a unit of a force and 1 kg equates to 9.81 N, or roughly 10 N. Moment is the turning force created by the mass acting over a distance or arm and is calculated by multiplying the arm by the mass or weight: Moment = Arm x Mass or Weight. Moments aft of the datum are by convention positive and moments forward of the datum are negative. The Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing the total moment by the total mass or weight: CG =Total Moment / Total Weight. Assuming that the datum is at the nose gear, the CG is: CG =Total Moment / Total Weight = [(2 x 7 250 N x 0 m) + (4 x 60 000 N x 10 m)] / 254 500 N = 2 400 000 N.m / 254 500 N = 9.43 m aft of the nose wheel.

Calculate the ZFM Moment And the ZFM Moment is: BEM Moment + Front Seat Occupant’s Moment + Aft Seat Occupant’s Moment = 187 645.5 in.lb + (200 lb x 79 in) + (90 lb x 117 in) = 213 975.5 in.lb 3. Detrmine CG Enter with ZFM 2 705 lb from the right side moving horizontally and with ZFM Moment 213 975.5 in.lb from the left side moving parallel with the moment grid lines. At the intersection of the two lines, move down parallel with the CG grid lines to read CG: 79.1 in. aft of the datum. Alternatively, the Zero Fuel Mass CG position can be computed through the CG formula more precisely: ZFM CG = ZFM Moment / ZFM = 213 975.5 in.lb / 2 705 lb. = 79.1 in. aft of the datum.",

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch, but the more downforce at the elevator is required to change the pitch attitude. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and horizontal stabiliser, called as \"trim tanks\", have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons: To provide extra fuel capacity. To maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum (aft) position for minimum drag, improved manoeuvrability and, as a consequence, for maximum fuel economy, as less downforce on the horizontal stabiliser is required. The fuel in these tanks may automatically drain as fuel is used from the centre and wing tanks or may be actively controlled by the crew through transfer systems.",

In order to counteract the resultant downward pitch of the aircraft's nose, the tailplane must generate a compensatory downward force, akin to the mechanism of a seesaw. This corrective force induces an upward movement of the elevators, which unfortunately amplifies drag, thereby intensifying fuel consumption and curtailing the aircraft's range and endurance.

With the cg furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively controllable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward longitudinal control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight. If the CG is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the CP diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane beyond acceptable limits and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable.

When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the main factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. None of the structural or performance limitations are permitted to be exceeded. In order to ensure the aircraft remains within all of the limitations, a calculation is required to check which is the most restrictive on that particular flight. The single most restrictive limitation is called the allowed takeoff mass (ATOM) and is the lowest of performance limited takeoff mas (PLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance.",

When you create more lift, you create more induced drag, and your performance goes down. The aircraft cruises slower with a forward CG location because of increased drag. The drag is increased because a higher AoA and much downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. This pitch down moment has to be corrected by an up deflection of the elevator to keep straight and level flight. This increases the aircraft’s weight by adding a high downward force.

To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer (between the front and the rear CG limit). Proper CG location is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controllability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage: As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. When the CG is at the forward limit, the aircraft's nose may become too heavy making it difficult to raise the nose during landing, leading to a higher likelihood of landing on the nose wheel rather than the main wheels.",

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

To sum up, an aft CG: Increases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Decreases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM can be increased The stick forces required will be less Rotation will be easier Stall speed decreases, which permits a higher ceiling altitude Makes flare easier during landing, thus decreasing LDR and increasing MLM Range and Endurance increase due to the decreased fuel consumption",

Many speeds used in performance calculations, such as the rotate speed, VR and the safety spped, V2, are extracted through graphs and tables and are based on the stalling speed from which they differ by a standard safety margin according to the rules and regulations. So, they also increase as the aircraft weight increases, so as to keep the safety margin constant.

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively manoeuvrable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward pitch control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight.",

Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. Landing fuel is the remaining fuel in the tanks on landing. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Landing situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Max Allowed Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel (Block fuel - Taxi fuel) = 4 200 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 15 kg) = 1 120 kg. Landing situation: Performance Limited Landing Mass - DOM - Landing fuel (Block - Trip -Taxi fuel) = 3 610 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 440 kg - 15 kg) = 970 kg.

One IG of water weighs ten libres. To convert fuel volumes into fuel masses, we need to know that fuel is lighter than water. A volume of AVGAS weighs approximately 73% of the equivalent volume of water, which means that its Specific Gravity (SG) is approximately 0.73. This means that an IG of AVGAS weighs: 10 x 0.73 lb = 7.3 lb. Thus, 1 USG will weigh: 7.3 lb x 0.83 IG = 6 lb.",

            "explanation": "Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is the maximum permissible mass of an aeroplane with no usable fuel. The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. Due to the necessity of using the mass of fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks to balance the internal load, there is a restriction on the amount of weight that can be placed in the fuselage before fuel must be added to the wing tanks. Exceeding the MZFM limit can result in significant structural damage to the aircraft. The greatest stress on the wing roots happens when the wing fuel tanks are empty. To prevent the wings from permanently bending upward as fuel is used, manufacturers impose a maximum zero fuel mass on the structure. Since the stress during flight is at its greatest when the wing fuel tanks are empty, MZFM is determined during approach for landing. Fuel jettison is a procedure used to quickly reduce the weight of an aircraft by releasing fuel into the atmosphere. This procedure is typically performed in emergency situations when an aircraft needs to land but is too heavy to do so safely. Note: The option 'Immediately after fuel jettison (IFJ)' is not considered the correct option, because fuel jettison does not necessarily mean getting rid of all the fuel.",

For this question, just add up all the masses to find out the Total Gross Mass of the aircraft, after loading the female passenger with her baggage: Total Gross Mass = Delivered Mass + Pilot + Passenger + Baggage + Fuel = 1146 lb + 190 lb + 135 lb + 25 lb + 178 lb = 1674 lb. NOTE: The passenger's position seat (right-hand or centre) does not matter for mass calculations. It would be required for Centre of Gravity calculations.",

Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aeroplane less the usable fuel (DOM + Traffic Load or TOM - Fuel). For this question we will only consider the Zero-fuel and Take-off situations (ignoring the landing situation, since the given data do not permit so), subtracting from the Allowed Take-off Mass (ATOM) and the Maximum Zero-Fuel Mass (MZFM) structural limits the Actual ZFM and the fuel mass (where applicable), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: ATOM - Actual ZFM - TOF = 76720 kg - 55063 kg - 16299 kg = 5358 kg underloaded. MZFM - Actual ZFM = 62731 kg - 55063 kg = 7668 kg underload. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and then apply the additional cargo of 4500 kg we will check out if we are finally underloaded or overloaded and by how much: 5358 kg - 4500 kg = 858 kg underloaded. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Load/Trim sheet is a document which enables the Pilot-in-Command to determine that both the aircraft's load and its distribution throughout the fuselage are such that the mass and balance limits of the aircraft are not exceeded.

Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. Firstly, we need to establish the Lowest Allowed Mass for Take off: a: 51 300 kg + 10 800 kg = 62 100 kg b: 62 800 kg c: 54 900 kg + 7 700 kg = 62 600 kg Thus, the Lowest Allowed Mass for Take off is \"a\": 62 100 kg. The Operating Mass (OM) is: Dry Operating Mass + Take-off Fuel = 34 900kg + 10 800 kg = 45 700 kg. Therefore, the Allowed Traffic Load will be: \"a\" - OM = 62 100 kg - 45 700 kg = 16 400 kg.",

Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Zero-fuel situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Maximum Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel = 71 204 kg - 40 195 kg - (13 800 kg - 215 kg) = 17 424 kg.

According to the question, we will need an extra amount of fuel, 8 300 kg, so as to ensure that this amount will be on board when landing in Paris. Additionally, taxi fuel, 180 kg, is required. So, adding the above fuel amounts, we get the Minimum Block Fuel: 7 054 kg + 8 300 kg + 180 kg = 15 534 kg, which is less than 22 000 kg, so we are within limits in terms of tank capacity. Also, check if with the above Minimum Block Fuel, 15534 kg, any maximum fuel load than can be loaded for both take-off and landing situations is exceeded, by subtracting the Dry Operating Mass and the Traffic Load from the two allowed structural limits given: Take-off: 69 002 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 16 390 kg (more than 15 534 kg, so we are within limits). Landing: 63 360 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 10 748 kg (more than 8 300 kg, so we are within limits). Note: No information has been given about the fuel cost of this extra fuel weight on the first flight. In real life we calculate for this using the flight plan adjustment figures or rules of thumb but the examiner obviously did not want to add the extra complexity of that to this question so has chosen to ignore it completely. This is good for us, of course, as it makes the question easier. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "This question, like many others, tests knowledge of both various mass definitions and also their relationship to each other. An ability to sketch and understand a diagram, is considered an essential skill in this subject. CAP 696 defines Operating Mass (OM) as the DOM plus fuel but without traffic load. Taking this definition further, the Basic Empty Mass (BEM) plus the Variable Load (VL) equal the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). To the DOM, if fuel is added then we arrive at the Operating Mass (OM). This fuel is normally take-off fuel prior to flight and usable fuel after take-off. More detailed definitions of both BEM and DOM from CAP 696 are found here: Basic Empty Mass (Basic Mass) is the mass of an aeroplane plus standard items such as: unusable fuel and other unusable fluids; lubricating oil in engine and auxiliary units; fire extinguishers; pyrotechnics; emergency oxygen equipment; supplementary electronic equipment. Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as: Crew and crew baggage. Catering and removable passenger service equipment. Potable water and lavatory chemicals. Food and beverages Note: The term 'variable load' is not directly defined in CAP 696 but the details are listed in the definition of DOM, as above.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question, we will consider the take-off and landing situations, subtracting from the Maximum Permissible Take-off Mass and the Performance Limited Landing Mass limits the OM, the TL and the fuel masses (as required), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Max TOM - OM - TL = 6400 - 4480 - 1870 = + 50 kg. Max LM - (OM- Trip fuel) - TL = 5430 - (4480-1090) - 1870 = + 170 kg. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and the \"+\" sign indicates that it is underloaded by 50 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Regarding this question, it's worth noting that all the options are given in kilograms. Additionally, the question provides a fuel density of 0.8, which means we can't directly utilize the \"kg\" data from the provided figure. Instead, we need to calculate the total usable fuel in liters and then apply the fuel density (x 0.8). Assuming the pilot decides to refuel only the wing tanks, both inner and outer, for the aforementioned purposes, the total available fuel on-board will be: [(Outer tanks x 2) + (Inner tanks x 2)] x 0.8 = [(880 ltr x 2) + (6 924 ltr x 2)] x 0.8 = 12 486 kg",

Specific Gravity 0.79 means that a volume of fuel weighs 79% of the equivalent volume of water. For this question, 2200 lt of fuel volume has a fuel mass of: 2200 lt x 0.79 = 1738 kg.",

CAP 696 defines the Centre of Gravity (CG) as: That point through which the force of gravity is said to act on a mass. Looking at the answers: 'through the main wheels of its undercarriage assembly.' --> INCORRECT. It is possible for the CG to act through the main wheels, but normally it is located between the nose wheel and main wheels. A CG behind the main wheels would cause the aircraft to tip over. 'through a point defined as the datum point.' --> INCORRECT. The datum point is the point on the longitudinal axis (or extension thereof) from which the centres of gravities of all masses are referenced, but not act through. 'through its centre of gravity.' --> CORRECT. See above from CAP 696 'through its centre of pressure.' --> INCORRECT. Lift acts through the centre of pressure.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: It appears that in the official exam, a table will be provided, indicating the necessary stabilizer trim settings for various configurations (flaps 5 and flaps 15) and different CG %MAC values. However, since we don't have access to the official annex, we have included the relevant information directly in the question text. The stabilizer trim is carefully adjusted to provide just the right level of assistance during rotation. When the center of gravity (CG) is situated forward, resulting in the aircraft being nose-heavy, it necessitates more assistance from the stabilizer trim. Conversely, if the CG is positioned toward the rear, there is already a natural tendency for the nose to pitch up (tail-heavy), resulting in a reduced requirement for assistance. In essence, the larger the CG number, the smaller the stabilizer trim setting number. Now, the question informs us that the CG position is at 7% of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC), which is very close to the forward limit of 6%. In such a situation, with a forward CG (nose-heavy), we would desire greater assistance from the stabilizer trim, thus indicating a high trim setting number. According to the given information, for a CG of 7% MAC, the appropriate stabilizer trim setting would be around 5 - 5.1. However, the pilots mistakenly set it to 4. This setting is more suitable for a rear CG, not the current nose-heavy condition of 7% MAC. Consequently, with this incorrect trim setting, there is insufficient assistance to handle the nose-heavy situation, leading to a longer take-off run.",

A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. As the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since less drag needs to be overcome, less thrust will be required and fuel consumption per nautical mile will reduce. As a result, the range will be increased for an aft CG movement. Note: An Aft CG movement (tail-heavy aircraft) results in a reduced longitudinal stability.",

From this intersection point, draw a horizontal line to the right until you reach the REF line. Then, follow the reference line until it intersects with the line corresponding to 3 600 lb. Now, continue horizontally to the right, crossing the next REF line. Draw a diagonal line until it intersects with the reference line representing a TAS of 120 kt.

A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16000 kgin and with flap retraction from 15° to 0° the moment changes by -14000 kgin. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 15°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16000 kgin -(-14000 kgin) = -2000 kgin.",

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

When determining the final CG position for flight, there will inevitably be inaccuracies in the loadsheet, in the actual mass of the item and its position on the aircraft. Fuel consumption, fuel transfer, passenger movement, crew movement and configuration changes in flight need to be accounted for. Also, both the CG position and the safe envelope evolve throughout the flight. Indeed, the weight of the aircraft evolves mainly as fuel is burned. As for the CG, its position is sensitive to various phenomena ranging from landing gear, flaps and slats position to passengers or cabin crew movements from one end of the cabin to the other. To allow a margin of safety for these variations, the Certified CG limits are reduced to the operational limits, i.e. the operational CG limits are more restrictive than the certified CG limits, because error margins have been taken into account. The Operational CG limits are determined by the Operator: one for Take-off and another one for Zero-fuel. Although there were attempts at developing systems to measure the aircraft weight and CG position, no robust solution has yet been found. The best way to make sure that the CG remains within a safe envelope throughout the flight, is to both define an operational envelope that includes safety margins and to perform a correct CG calculation.",

The operator must also account for and document the accumulated effects of modifications and repairs between weighings, by either weighing the equipment added or removed, or by using standard masses. It must re-weighed, only if the accumulated effects of these modifications lead to a change of the DOM by more than 0.5% of the MLM or the CG shifts by more than 0.5% of the MAC. This question refers to an individual aircraft and since no further data are given for any DOM change of CG shift, not immediate re-weighing is required.

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The fuel is fed from the tanks in the correct sequence to maintain wing bending relief and CG position. The CG position does change as fuel is burnt off, but within defined limits. If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Passenger and crew movements along the fuselage during flight are inevitable, but allowed for, resulting in CG changes. Small trim changes may be required to compensate for this movement. On most large aircraft, the main gear retracts sideways and creates no change to CG position. The nose gear can retract either forwards or backwards. As it does so, it will cause the CG to move a small amount in that direction, but is usually considered to be negligible. Any change of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) incidence angle does not have any effect to the CG position.",

            "explanation": "As the wing tanks fuel is consumed during flight, the CG moves aft towards the trim tank (since the fuel in the trim tank is isolated and not being burnt - resulting in a tail-heavy situation). An aircraft with forward CG is “heavier” and consequently, slower than the same aircraft with the CG further aft. For a forward CG location, a “nose-up” trim is required in most aircraft to maintain level cruising flight. Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces to produce a greater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage, which adds to the wing loading and the total lift required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained. This requires a higher AOA (Angle of Attack) of the wing, which results in more drag and, in turn, increases fuel burn and reduces flight range. Furthermore, if the CG moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable. A forward CG with the increase in stability will make it easier to recover from a stall. However, maneuverability will be reduced. The opposite occurs for an Aft CG location. For the same aircraft, an aft CG location results in an increased flight range and maneuverability, and a decrease in drag. However, in this case, fuel will be isolated in the trim tank and the aircraft will be unable to use it. Therefore, flight range will be reduced. Note that Increasing stability about any axis decreases manoeuvrability and controllability, and increases stick (or pedal) forces.

Section 1 (top) is used to establish the Limiting Take-off Mass and the Maximum AllowableTraffic Load that can be carried, Section 2 (middle) shows the traffic load distribution and Section 3 (bottom) sums up the load and cross checks that any limit has not been exceeded. Section 1 must be completed first so as to find the three potential take-off masses (a,b and c values). The Allowable Take-Off Mass section of the load sheet is in Section 1 and it is equal to the lowest of the a, b, c values. The “a” value is the take-off mass you would achieve, if you loaded the aircraft to the MZFM and then added the intended fuel load and it is equal to MZFM plus Take-Off Fuel. The “b” value is the regulated take-off mass for the take-off airfield conditions as existing and among Performance-Limited TOM and Maximum Structural TOM “b” value is the lower one. The “c” value is the take-off mass you would achieve if you were to land at the regulated landing mass and then added back the trip fuel and is equal to the Max Landing Mass or Performance-Limited Landing Mass (whichever is lower) plus the Trip Fuel.

            "explanation": "Generally, the Centre of Gravity (CG) is expressed as a distance (L) relative to a datum or reference point, but CG is usually expressed in swept wing aircraft as a distance relative to the Mean Aerodyanmic Chord (MAC) of a wing. The MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord) represents the chord of an imaginary airfoil that has the same aerodynamic characteristics as the actual wing. To be more specific, the CG is expressed as a percentage of its position along the MAC (%MAC) from the leading edge (Le), also called LEMAC. LEMAC: This is the Leading Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord. It represents 0% of the MAC. TEMAC: This is the rear edge of the MAC and is considered 100% of the MAC. If the CG is at a distance L from the datum, then the correct formula to calculate the CG position as a percentage of the MAC is: ((L - LEMAC)/MAC) x 100. The CG is at 25% MAC, which means it is 25% of the chord length back from the LEMAC. This means that the CG is located behind the Leading Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (LEMAC). Note: The option 'Forward of the Trailing Edge of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (TEMAC)' is technically true, but it describes the position in relation to the TEMAC which is less commonly used as a reference point for CG.",
