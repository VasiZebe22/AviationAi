Range control of the ND: this has an essential influence on the optimum tilt setting. Gain control: this adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. Radar modes: weather (WX) or weather + turbulence (WX + T). Source: safetyfirst.airbus.com/ The \"gain\" of a radar adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. A high gain (high sensitivity) means that even very small reflected pulses will show up as returns on the radar screen, but this means that the radar screen can easily get too cluttered with very small returns that we do not want to see. A low gain will make the radar less sensitive, and so only large returns will actually show up on the display. Changing the gain also changes the sensitivity of the different colour bands, which is very useful. The gain can be changed in flight, for instance when looking at a cumulus cloud that does not look too violent, we might be happy to proceed through it if we know which bits are worst within it. With standard gain, the whole cloud might be green, but with the gain set a little higher, it may be possible to see the worst patches within it. The same goes for a thunderstorm that is huge and all red on the display, reducing the gain can give more detail about the weather within.",

The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice. Note that the areas in which the concentration of droplets decreases rapidly (which are marked on the radar screen by a sharp fall in signal intensity) are normally areas in which the most severe turbulence can be encountered. These are areas in which the strong up-going air currents are in close proximity to downward flowing currents and there is a strong risk of severe vertical wind shear. These areas will be identified on the radar screen by a rapid change in appearance of the cloud return - steep change in colors of the return (steep color gradient). If you identify this area on your radar screen, avoid that area! * Green: light precipitation, slight turbolence * Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation,light turbolence * Red: heavy precipitation, medium to severe turbolence * Magenta: Extremely high precipitation, severe turbolence So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water. It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence. Clear air turbulence (CAT) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar. There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft.",

The pilot may manually transmit a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse when the \"IDENT\" button on the pilot's transponder is pressed. By pushing the “IDENT” button, the transponder transmits an additional pulse at the end of the normal response pulse train. The benefit of the squawk \"IDENT\" function is a manual identification of the aircraft. The controller may ask via the radio communication frequency to \"IDENT\" in case of any doubt of identification on the controller display. Upon acquisition of the SPI pulse, the transponder indication changes/begins to flash on the controller's radar display for approximately 20 seconds. This produces a distinctive display so that a controller can pick out a particular aircraft by asking the pilot to “Squawk Ident”.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) works on the pulse technique and echo principle which used electromagnetic waves to detect objects and detect their returning echoes. It provides bearing and distance information of detected objects. The radar relies on reflected signals but is not aware if they are received from aircraft or from other objects (e.g. terrain, buildings, clouds). Such reflections are called clutter. Moving Target Indicator (MTI) technology is able to eliminate echoes from stationary objects such as terrain, buildings, etc. while leaving only relevant information displayed on the screen (aircraft). A target is therefore discriminated against clutter. MTI takes advantage of the Doppler effect: A moving target will be at different distance from the radar over a period of time. The reflection of radar pulses from a moving target will therefore occur at a varying distance with time - each successive pulse will be reflected from a different distance to the radar. The result will be a varying phase shift of the pulses due to a doppler effect. Stationary objects will reflect pulses at a constant phase shift.",

Manual Tilt Management The tilt refers to the angle between the antenna beam centreline and the horizon. The flight crew should regularly scan the area ahead of the aircraft. In order to identify the strongest weather returns, the flight crew should tilt the weather radar antenna up and down. To obtain a correct display of a storm cell, the flight crew must use the tilt knob to point the weather radar beam to the most reflective part of the storm cell. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. We believe this is the point they want to get across in this question. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

If we climb higher (perhaps to overfly the storm), then that same tilt setting will be looking higher up within the storm, and will be seeing the ice crystals, rather than the wet hail and large water droplets. This is why we would set the tilt further downwards after making such a climb. It is important to remember that there are other questions asking about the tilt setting during take-off and climb out. Well of course, the setting at that time of flight would be quite high, to see the weather the aircraft is climbing towards and avoid clutter from ground returns. After that, though, the tilt setting should gradually be reduced until the cruise, and then in the descent, gradually increased again to avoid ground returns. Remember also that the radar is automatically stabilised so it follows the horizon plus/minus any tilt, not the aircraft attitude plus/minus tilt.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

The tilt depends on the flight altitude and the altitude of the next flight phase. In mountainous regions, for instance, high peaks may trigger the AWR to show solid echoes even though they are produced by the ground. For this reason, when the aircraft descends to a lower altitude, a higher tilt setting is more beneficial to avoid reflections from the ground (\"ground clutter\").

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! RADAR is an incredibly useful tool to aviation, and is used in many forms, for multiple different jobs in civil aviation. For starters, it is split into primary and secondary radar. Primary radar is where a transceiver sends out electromagnetic pulses or waves that are reflected off items in the environment, back to the transceiver, and the time taken to travel to and from the object is measured, to give an indication of its range. The radar scans back and forth to figure out the direction of the object, and in doing so, gets a direction and distance, so can plot the location on a display. Secondary radar is where an interrogator sends out an interrogation signal, transponders pick this signal up, then send a reply signal, which is good as it can carry more information, such as squawk codes and altitudes, as used in SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar). Aircraft are fitted with a primary radar to track weather and navigate (Airborne Weather Radar) as well as in the radio altimeter, and can use secondary radar to detect other aircraft for collision avoidance (ACAS/TCAS), as well as for DME (which is technically a secondary radar system, the aircraft is the interrogator). For this question, we are just talking about primary radar, so TCAS and SSR are not correct options, and the only correct option is weather radar, which is a common item to have on board a commercial aircraft. Radio altimeters are also primary radars fitted to an aircraft, but none of the options correspond to that. Weather radars can also show terrain nearby in a way, but this is not their primary purpose at all, and is very rarely used these days.",

Therefore, SSR systems have a greater range than PSR systems, on the order of 250+ NM from the radar site. In addition, unlike PSR, which relies on reflected pulses, SSR's operation is not affected by ground interference due to its unique transmission and reception methods. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR An airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. AWR detects drops of precipitation such as rain and wet hail. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

It refers to a system which emits pulses of electromagnetic energy, then waits for any of those pulses to return, and if/when they do, it measures the time between emitting the pulse and receiving the reflected pulse, which it can then use to calculate the distance from the target, as the electromagnetic waves all travel at the speed of light. It does this whilst scanning the sky from side to side, so each pulse targets a different area of the sky horizontally, and by sending pulses many hundreds of times per second, the radar can scan the region and get both a bearing and a distance to each target. This can then be plotted on a display for the radar operator to see. With primary radar, you can therefore only see locations of targets, and can extrapolate their movements over time to get a rough idea of their speed, if the operator is skilled. Other radar systems can provide more information than this (SSR - Secondary Surveillance Radar), which use a different method of radar operation",

It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING The measurement of bearing is achieved using the searchlight principle. This involves concentrating radio pulses into narrow beams, which can be accomplished by either shortening the wavelength or increasing the size of the aerial (in advanced systems, this is done electronically). The narrow beam is then rotated at a constant speed. When an echo is received, the direction of the object is determined based on the direction of the beam at the time of receiving the echo. This direction is measured from a fixed reference point or datum. Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

PRF is one of the main factors that determine the maximum theoretical unambiguous range of a pulse radar. The trasmitter must remain “silent” while the receiver is “listening” for echoes. If the design maximum range is 200NM the receiver must be allowed to “listen” for the period of time fro when a pulse has been trasmitted untill it can go to 200NM and than return. That is a round trip of 400 NM, which would require a longer “silent period” than a radar whit a range of 100NM where the pulses have to travel only 200NM. Therefore we can say that a lower PRF enables a longer maximum theoretical range: max therorical range is inversly proportional to the PRF. The following formula may be used to calculate the max theoretical unambiguous range : Range (in Km) = 300 000 ÷ ( PRF x 2 ), or if we need to find the required PRF based on a specific unambiguous range needed, we can rearrange the formula: PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( Range (in Km) x 2)",

            "explanation": "THUNDERSTORM AVOIDANCE It’s simple: Airplanes and thunderstorms don’t mix. Flying through a Thunderstorm, especially in a light aircraft, can be deadly. Thunderstorms can produce airframe-shattering turbulence, damaging hail, sudden and dramatic wind shear, strong, gusty winds—sometimes as much as 20 miles from the edge of a cell. Never regard any thunderstorm lightly. According to ICAO AC 120-88A Appendix 1: AVOID any convective activity (CBs) en route by at least 20 nautical miles. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. Generally speaking, you'll find the best chance for clear, smooth air on the upwind side of a thunderstorm. Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self stabilising at a chosen attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch/roll changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high in the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and high again during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display. On modern aircraft, there is often an auto tilt setting that is used to relieve pilot workload, but can be overriden for manual tasks. In this question, the best feature is the ability to scan other levels for more/less precipitation, potentially to choose a better level to penetrate precipitation at. It would not be useful to scan clear air above a developing thunderstorm as the CB cloud will continue rising, so this data becomes useless very quickly.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) : a surveillance radar system which uses reflected radio signals. Source: ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM Principle of operation: The radar antenna rotates (usually at 5-12 rpm) emits a pulse of radio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the antenna. The PSR output data uses polar coordinate system: it provides range and bearing of the targets found in respect of the antenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from the antenna and not the horizontal distance. The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse (the speed of propagation is the speed of light) and the bearing is obtained from the antenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the antenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. The antenna radiation patern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, whith some approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. The advantage of Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) is that it operates totally independently of the target aircraft (no action from the aircraft is required for it to provide a radar return). The disadvantages of PSR are that, firstly, enormous amounts of power must be radiated to ensure returns from the target. This is especially true if long range is desired. Secondly, because of the small amount of energy returned at the receiver, returns may be easily disrupted due to such factors as changes of target attitude or signal attenuation due to heavy rain. This may cause the displayed target to 'fade'. Thirdly, correlation of a particular radar return with a particular aircraft requires an identification process. When PSR was the only type of radar available, this was typically achieved by the Controller instructing an aircraft to turn and observing same on their display, or by correlating a DME distance report by the aircraft with the position of a particular return along a known track. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) requires an airborne transponder which responds to the receipt of a pulse from a ground-based antenna by transmitting a return signal. Because the transponder transmits a much stronger signal than that which is reflected off an aircraft in primary radar systems, greater range and reliability can be achieved with secondary radar and cheaper and more efficient ground equipment can be used. Additionally, information such as altitude and a code can be added to the returned signal from the transponder which is then displayed on the operator’s screen. The great advantages of SSR are three: firstly, because the reply signal is transmitted from the aircraft it is much stronger when received at the ground station, thus giving the possibility of much greater range and reducing the problems of signal attenuation; similarly, the transmitting power required of the ground station for a given range is much reduced, thus providing considerable economy; and thirdly, because the signals in each direction are electronically coded the possibility is offered to transmit additional information between the two stations. The disadvantage of SSR is that it requires a target aircraft to carry an operating transponder. Thus SSR is a 'dependant' surveillance system. For this reason, PSR will operate in conjunction with SSR in certain areas for the foreseeable future so that 'non-cooperating' targets, such as some light aircraft, can be detected. SSR has several modes of operation, the basic civil mode being Mode A. In this mode the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. The code system is octal; that is, each of the code digits may be any of the numbers 0-7. There are thus 4096 possible four-digit codes. Another principal SSR mode currently used is Mode C. In this mode the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. The use of Mode C was introduced in Australia in the late 1980s with the acquisition of ground systems, such as ATCARDS, capable of processing the information. A further mode, Mode S (or 'Mode Select'), is also used. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting this mode are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. This reduces problems of garbling between SSR returns from aircraft in close proximity. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Here we can see that the very intense cell above aerodrome A is blocking the vast majority of returns in a corridor of shadow behind it. Therefore, Aerodrome B's precipitation is unknown. Aerodrome C, however, is not shadowed by a huge cell, and the low intensity green cell in front of it is not enough to block the majority of the pulses, so therefore the radar image at C is correct, little to no precipitation.",

Learning Objective 062.03.03.06.04: Explain how wind shear can be detected by a modern weather radar. This question has to be very specific in order for it not to have 2 correct answers. The fact that it says \"modern aircraft\" certainly means that they are referring to the learning objectives above. These refer to the turbulence and wind shear detection capabilities of modern airborne weather radars (AWRs), not the precipitation detection which has been around for over 70 years. Between windshear detection and turbulence detection, they are almost the same process, but windshear detection involves input from the Air Data Computer (ADC), via the GPWS system to produce windshear alerting (and it is not an available answer option). Therefore the correct answer can only be turbulence detection. We look ahead using our AWR to check our planned routing, and occasionally choose a better one. Turbulence can be detected by modern AWRs, as the movement of the precipitation within the cloud causes a doppler shift on the returning radar pulses, so the radar can form an idea of the air movement patterns in that area. If they are erratic, then turbulence exists in that region. This cannot detect CAT (clear air turbulence), as that has no associated radar returns, as it is invisible by definition.",

These AAs are unique addresses registered to a particular aircraft. There is also a much larger ability for transfer of information through mode S, with many different aircraft parameters able to be transferred to the ground through ELS (elementary surveillance) or EHS (enhanced surveillance) systems, and even a capacity of communications via datalink. Mode S transponders use the same frequencies as Mode A/C transponders, so are backwards compatible, and the SSR ground station produces different interrogation pulses to require different responses from the transponders in the area. For example, the interrogation station can send out Mode A/C only \"All Calls\", with a short fourth pulse (P4), which means nothing to the older Mode A/C transponders (they will reply normally), but means that the mode S transponders will reply with only their mode A/C information. This backwards compatibility means that theoretically, the interrogation signal could ask for mode A responses only, so the transponder (even though it is fully mode S capable) will just respond with its 4 digit squawk code.",

The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

MODE S Modes A and C are limited to 4 096 available codes. With an increasing volume of air traffic, these systems become prone to interference. Mode S was invented to overcome these limitations. \"S\" stands for Selective Addressing, which means that a specific aircraft my be interrogated by the controller. One of the main features of Mode S is the availability of codes. The aircraft address code will be made up of a 24-bit code. Considering a 24-bit binary code, it provides over 16 million (224 = 16 777 216) possible hard-coded unique addresses to be allocated. These are allocated to a particular aircraft, unlike a squawk code which is allocated for a particular flight plan. Mode S differs from Modes A and C due to the additional data message up to 112 bits that is transmitted via interrogation.",

Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) is the number of occurrences (pulses) each second. The PRF has a large significance on maximum range. Depending on how far the radar wishes to search for objects and what the visible range is, the Pulse Repetition interval has to be set in a way to always allow the pulse to reach the range limits and return, before the next pulse is sent. The maximum theoretical unambiguous range is calculate by the formula: Range [km] = 300 000 ÷ (PRF × 2) In the above formula, the range is given in kilometres and the PRF is in pps. The formula includes \"300 000\" which represents the number of km the light travels every second (speed of light). The minimum detection range of a pulse radar is determined primarily by the pulse length/width. Longer pulses are better for long range detection, as there is more energy available to be reflected, similar to using a higher power radar, but with very slightly less accuracy on the exact distance. The problem is that longer pulses do not allow short range radar reflections, as the pulse is still being emitted whilst the first reflections are returning. This is why we cannot have the best of both worlds, long maximum range and short minimum range, and compromises have to be made. Therefore, a lower PRF (longer gap between pulses) means longer maximum range. A lower Pulse Length allows for shorter minimum range.",

Why the question has been written in the first place is confusing, as the question is lacking information about the exact issue, and we should not need to understand cathode ray tubes as part of the syllabus. A cathode ray tube is an old style of visual display, commonly seen in old TVs (before flat screens), with large boxes behind the screen. It was very common to have CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays in older aircraft whenever a screen was required in the flight deck. They are heavy, draw quite a lot of power, and break easily. They operate by firing electrons through the tube and using electromagnets to bend the electrons either up or down to a point on the screen. When the electrons hit the photoluminescent coating at the end of the tube, it lights up, and by scanning a beam backwards and forwards along a horizontal line very quickly, this forms an image, which can even be made in colour. If there is just a bright line on the screen, it likely means that the electromagnetic coils in the CRT display are broken, or that the electron beam scanner does not work (depending on whether the line is vertical or horizontal), and all the electrons are ending up in a single line. The other options here to do with broken weather radar equipment would at least show the usual information on the screen (range of scan, tilt setting, etc.). Possibly, a vertical line could show up if the scanner was not rotating and many returns were being picked up from directly ahead, but the question seemed to say that the line was the only thing on the screen, which would not seem right if everything was working except the rotation. The feedback also indicated that a faulty cathode ray tube was the correct answer. Again, this should be appealed, it is ridiculous.",

However, the option \"By selecting a suitable echo from the display, obtaining the relative bearing and distance, and converting it into a true bearing to plot on the chart.\" has been confirmed by feedback to be correct in official exams. The pilot may take a relative bearing from an AWR display and would then use the aircraft heading to turn the relative heading into a magnetic or true bearing to. Thereafter, the reciprocal from the ground feature can be back-plotted as true or magnetic. On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

CAL – rotate to the CAL position for automatic gain control. The CAL position results in a calibrated map or weather radar display. Gain control does not affect turbulence or windshear. Manual – rotating the knob out of CAL varies gain between MIN and MAX. VAR is shown on the display, indicating that the gain has been changed from the calibrated position. MIN – position reduces gain approximately 16 dBz below the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward min reduces precipitation intensity thresholds, requiring greater intensity precipitation levels to display in red. MAX – position increases gain 10 dBz over the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward MAX increases precipitation intensity thresholds allowing lesser intensity precipitation levels to display in red. Max gain should only be used at cruise altitudes to help see less reflective frozen storm tops. (Increasing the GAIN, increases the sensitivity of the receiver.)",

Mode S was invented to overcome these limitations. \"S\" stands for Selective Addressing, which means that a specific aircraft my be interrogated by the controller. One of the main features of Mode S is the availability of codes: The aircraft address code will be made up of a 24 bit code. Considering a 24-bit binary code, it provides over 16 million (224 = 16 777 216) possible hard-coded individual addresses to be allocated. Mode S differs from Modes A and C due to the additional data message up to 112 bits that is transmitted via interrogation.",

When these pulses encounter an aircraft or object, some of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. The PSR uses a polar coordinate system to provide information on the detected targets. It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING Bearing measurement in radar systems utilizes the searchlight principle, where radio pulses are focused into narrow beams. This can be achieved by reducing the wavelength or electronically enlarging the antenna in advanced systems. The narrow beam is then rotated at a consistent speed. By analyzing the direction of the received echo, the bearing of the object can be determined based on the azimuth of the antenna at the time of receiving the echo. This directional information is measured from a fixed reference point or datum Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing (antenna's azimuth) and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder. SSR positively identifies an aircraft’s primary response by displaying its code and call sign alongside.",

Gain control: this adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. Radar modes: weather (WX) or weather + turbulence (WX + T). Early generation of full manual controlled radars were without auto tilt. Honeywell introduced the first weather radar featuring with an automatic tilt computation named “Autotilt”. When in Autotilt mode, the radar uses the EGPWS terrain database and automatically adjusts the antenna tilt based on the aircraft position, altitude, and the selected ND range (fig.6). The next generation of radars (fully automatic radars) optimize weather detection and decrease significantly the pilots’ workload necessary to understand the complete picture of the weather ahead. They included automatic functions, which: Scan airspace ahead of the aircraft with multiple beams Feature a three dimensional (3D) buffer to store weather data Automatically compute and adjust the antenna tilt Offer independent pilot control and display selection. This kind of radars automatically adjusts the gain and tilt based on various parameters (aircraft altitude, geographical area, season, time of the day) to obtain the best weather display in each geographic region.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self-stabilising at a particular attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, then reduced during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (such as developing thunderstorms) that could affect the aircraft. It should be kept low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate GNSS corrections over a wide-area. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches, to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft. To tune into a GNSS approach with SBAS augmentation, a 5-digit channel is entered into the guidance system, which then accesses the correct information to augment the GNSS signal as required. This 5-digit code will be given on any relevant approach plate, along with the SBAS that is to be used, such as EGNOS for Europe.",

Errors in the receiver, multipath signals, and some small atmospheric propagation errors can still occur, but the intention is to get the accuracy below 1m for aircraft on final approach. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station, although it is incredibly accurate and used for complex approaches down to ILS minimums, and lower minimums in the future is very much possible.",

The GPS receiver compares and matches these codes with the corresponding PRN codes stored in its memory. This comparison reveals the satellite's identity and the time when it transmitted the signal. By aligning the received signal with the reproduced signal, the receiver calculates a time of arrival (TOA), representing the measured time elapsed between signal transmission and reception from the satellite.

The satellites involved have geosynchronous orbits, meaning that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors through the many ground stations and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections, and detect any errors with the GNSS signals as soon as they occur. Whilst the answers do contain multiple correct statements, the one that we believe most applies to the question (integrity alerting within 6 seconds) is the answer mentioning just the one required geostationary satellite, as only one SBAS satellite is required to relay the loss-of-integrity alert message from the master station to the aircraft (although EGNOS does indeed have up to 4 geostationary satellites). It does appear that some feedback (particularly from the Polish ULC) states that the answer mentioning 4 satellites is the correct answer under that authority. Note: this question has multiple answers that are correct, and we have had to use the most recent feedback to choose the correct answer in our database. Any further feedback on this question would be very useful.",

            "explanation": "Satellite Navigation is based on a global network of satellites that transmit radio signals in medium earth orbit. The basic GPS service provides users with approximately 7.8 meter accuracy, 95% of the time, anywhere on or near the surface of the earth. To accomplish this, each satellite emits signals to receivers that determine their location by computing the difference between the time that a signal is sent and the time it is received travelling at 300,000 km/sec. The receiver uses the time difference between the time of signal reception and the broadcast time to compute the distance, or range, from the receiver to the satellite. With information about the ranges to 3 satellites and the location of the satellite when the signal was sent, the receiver can compute its own three-dimensional position. Pay attention: the clock on the GPS receiver might not be as accurate as the atomic clock on the GPS satellite, creating a very slight accuracy problem (clock error). GPS satellites broadcast two codes the coarse/acquisition (C/A) code which is unique to the satellite and the navigation data message. The codes contain information the receiver needs to determine latitude, longitude and altitude, and to synchronise its quartz clock with GPS time used through the GPS system. Current approvals for the use of GPS equipment in IFR operations require GPS-derived data to be in the WGS-84 coordinate system, or worldwide geodetic datum standard 84. Summary: using range from 3 satellites accurate 2D position fix is obtained ( Lat, Long, Time) using range from 4 satellites accurate 3D position fix is obtained ( Lat, Long, Altitude, Time)",

This can allow our aircraft to notice any suspicious GNSS position data and notify the pilots that it may not be correct. RAIM is a system which uses extra GNSS satellites to effectively verify the working order of the usual 4 required for a 3D position fix. 1 extra satellite (5 in total) can give the ability to notice when a fault occurs (Fault Detection). 2 extra satellites (6 in total) gives the ability to detect and identify which satellite is faulty (Fault Detection and Exclusion). This can have the issue (as in this question) of not enough satellite coverage, hence requiring another system to provide the integrity monitoring. GBAS (Ground Based Augmentation System) can provide integrity monitoring, but the airport has to be fully equipped with a GBAS system (which is still quite rare), the aircraft must be correctly equipped, and it only reaches out to approximately 30 km, which would not be suitable for the arrival phase of flight.

When the satellites are close together in the view of the GPS receiver antenna, the angles at which the position surfaces intersect become less favorable.

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS works by placing a few GNSS receivers around an aerodrome, each with an exact known location. The receivers then compare their uncorrected GNSS position with their actual position to work out the GNSS error in that location. That is the calculate into pseudorange corrections for each individual satellite, and broadcast to aircraft within 30 nm via the VHF data broadcast. To be clear, the satellites do not know this is happening, and do not care either; the GBAS just helps the aircraft augment its final position calculation slightly. because of this very localised correction, GBAS can make position accuracy extremely accurate, often much below 1 m accuracy.",

RAIM algorithms require a minimum of five visible satellites in order to perform Fault Detection (FD) and detect the presence of an unacceptably large position error for a given mode of flight. RAIM can maintain an accurate 3D fix by monitoring 5 satellites even if satellite signals become temporarily erroneous. When one satellite is excluded, the RAIM function is lost but accurate GNSS position is maintained. Newer GPS receivers incorporate Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) uses a minimum of six satellites not only to detect a faulty satellite but also to exclude it from the navigation solution so that the navigation function can continue without interruption.",

GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach.

Please inform us of any further feedback from the exams and let us know of the outcome of any appeals, thank you. Learning Objective 062.06.01.02.24: State that agreements have been concluded between the appropriate agencies for the compatibility and interoperability by any approved user of NAVSTAR and GLONASS systems. Learning Objective 062.06.01.02.25: State that the different GNSSs use different data with respect to reference systems, orbital data, and navigation services. This is a bit of a strange question, as it is obviously created based solely off the first learning objective above, but even that is quite vague, stating that \"agreements have been concluded\". From our own knowledge on this, the two systems can be used together, but there is some \"translation\" that has to occur to make them interoperable. For instance, if you've used a non-aviation Garmin device before, you might have seen that you can choose to use GPS only or GPS + GLONASS. One of the problems is that they use different reference systems, GPS uses WGS-84 and GLONASS uses PZ-90. Theoretically, using them both side-by side and mathematically converting the final product between the reference systems seems like the best way to use them at the moment. So we think that they are somewhat interoperable currently, but we do not know if they are actually truly interoperable yet, such as one system that uses both signals in the same way (we know that something similar to that is the goal, from the learning objectives and various EASA documentation), so we think that perhaps an examiner may have jumped the gun a little and written a question that is ahead of its time. Note: We would also like some further information on why option B, \"are two separate systems and only GPS is covered by EU regulations so only that service can be used by European Operators.\" is wrong. Currently, we know that only GPS is used in European airspace, and they are separate systems, so we do not see what the problem is with this answer, other than the \"correct\" answer (from feedback) being more in line with the learning objectives. Perhaps the examiner is not talking about flying in Europe, but that seems also misleading.",

            "explanation": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) are navigational systems that employ the use of many satellites orbiting the Earth (24 is a technical minimum). Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times (trilateration), every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals. It will surprise nobody that this was initially created for military use, and therefore there are some differences between the civilian and military versions of GPS (which was the first GNSS system, created by the US military). Two different frequencies actually exist for use by GPS, L1 transmits on a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, transmitting both a P (precision) and a C/A (Course Acquisition) codes. L2 transmits on a frequency of 1227.6 MHz, transmitting only a P code. SPS (the Standard Positioning Service) is available to all receivers, and uses the L1 carrier wave only, whereas PPS (the Precision Positioning Service) is available to authorised users (the military), using both the L1 and the L2 carrier waves. The use of 2 separate carrier waves (on 2 separate frequencies) is very useful, as the 2 different waves will be affectedly differently by ionospheric propagation effects as they travel through the atmosphere (which is a large source of GNSS error), and the difference between the two waves can used to extrapolate a very accurate range sphere from the satellite, causing very accurate positioning from the GNSS system by almost completely removing one of the largest errors, ionospheric propagation. This is not something that the SPS can do, using only the signal on L1 frequency, there is no opportunity for signal comparison, so the receivers use a standard model of ionospheric propagation, which can correct for ionospheric errors somewhat, but is not as precise as having two signals to compare. Note: This is quite old technology now, and civilians have access to other frequencies also these days such as L2C and L5, not just L1. EASA, however, only recognise this old system, described above, which is useful for us as the modern usage is far more complex to understand.",

LNAV/VNAV uses GNSS plus a barometric VNAV (or SBAS) system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower, as low as 200ft (ILS CAT I) due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - is gained by using SBAS augmentation to the GNSS signal, it is also a 3D approach standard with vertical guidance. SBAS CAT I approaches are precision approaches according to the more recent documents from ICAO. We are currently unsure as whether the examiners have caught up with these changes, so be on the lookout for the older questions which refer to LPV approaches as APV (Approach with Vertical Guidance). Classification into precision and non-precision approaches is no longer operationally useful in the current age, instead it is better to use 2D and 3D SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) operations use an extra geostationary satellite and a wide network of ground antennas with a master station to calculate the signal errors of GNSS location data, then apply a correction depending on the user's location to reduce measurable GNSS errors to a very small error margin. They also increase integrity monitoring so an alert of any unsuitability is issued within 6 seconds. Commonly confused is the GBAS Landing system (GLS), which is actually not a form of RNP APCH, and is a separate type of precision approach, that just happens to use ground based augmentation on GNSS signals, a localised version of SBAS.",

            "explanation": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error. In this question, the dilution of precision is the largest factor in accuracy reduction, as tropospheric propagation is usually a small effect, and not mentioned in the LOs. Also, receiver clock error is usually removed by the iterative process of resetting the receiver clock during stellite acquisition.",

Each fix excludes 1 satellite, so the receiver knows if they are all correct or not, thereby noticing if any one satellite becomes faulty, as all the separate fixes will then be different from each other. This can tell us within a few seconds if a satellite that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) and there is a further feature called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) if another extra satellite is available. RAIM prediction is used to find out whether the current satellites in the constellation are expected to be plentiful enough to provide RAIM at a particular place and time. The prediction software has orbital data which it can use to calculate the RAIM availability for the expected approach time at the destination, for example. If the RAIM prediction shows an error or negative message, this will be most likely due to insufficient satellites within line of sight of the position at the expected time, meaning there is unlikely to be enough satellites to provide this type of integrity monitoring.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, which receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate corrections to each GNSS satellite's pseudo-range. These corrections can then be used to refine GNSS measurements over huge areas, via the geostationary satellites above those areas. Geostationary Satellites are those that orbit exactly once every day, meaning that they stay over the same point on Earth. To do this they also have to be over the equator. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches (and massively increase integrity monitoring), to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.07: State that errors in the satellite orbits are due to: solar winds; gravitation of the Sun and the Moon. The sum of errors that the slightly incorrect pseudo-ranges bring to the position error is called the User Range Error (URE), and then when the receiver errors are added onto the URE, the User Equivalent Range Error (EURE) is given. The only main GNSS error that is not included in the EURE is geometric dilution of precision error. See the details highlighted in the full explanation below. FULL EXPLANATION Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. Multiple pseudoranges allow a process called trilateration to give a receiver its location. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Multipath error Receiver quality Dilution Of Precision (DOP) *Errors in Bold above are part of the URE (User Range Error) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. The navigation message includes ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. The almanac also gives the rough expected positions of the satellites in the future. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

It is also called \"differential GPS\", and can correct for errors induced by satellite clocks, ephemeris and ionospheric propagation to make the augmented GNSS signal very accurate. These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas, then interpreted and distributed by a ground station via a VDB antenna, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. There are still some errors that cannot be accounted for, but these are small. GBAS also provides integrity information about the GNSS satellites. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The VHF datalink (called the VDB) sends a signal that corrects the GNSS position, so that the onboard navigation system can guide the aircraft accurately on the approach, in both azimuth and glidepath. Note: For this question, the examiner is mostly asking \"what signals are sent in the VHF data broadcast?\". The correct answer is \"correction data\", as this is exactly what the GBAS system does, it corrects the GNSS position. The GBAS system does not send glidepath and azimuth data to the aircraft, like an ILS or MLS would. This is the primary objective of this question. The GBAS ground station does not tell the aircraft that it is 2 m right and 4 ft above the correct position, it tells it to adjust its GNSS position by a certain amount, then the aircraft makes sure it follows the approach correctly. It also does not matter whether the VDB antenna is classed as part of the ground station or not, that is not the defining difference in this question. The ground station transmits VDB signals via the antenna to the aircraft, which still means that the ground station sends signals to the aircraft.",

This can tell us within a few seconds if a satellite that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). The amount of required satellites can be reduced by 1 for 2D fixes, but these are uncommon, unless barometric altitude is fed to the GNSS system, which can allow an extra \"range sphere\", and effectively acts like another satellite. This is an Air-Based Augmentation System and occurs in a different place in the learning objectives.

It will surprise nobody that this was initially created for military use, and therefore there are some differences between the civilian and military versions of GPS (which was the first GNSS system, created by the US military). Two different frequencies actually exist for use by GPS, L1 transmits on a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, transmitting both a P (precision) and a C/A (Course Acquisition) codes. L2 transmits on a frequency of 1227.6 MHz, transmitting only a P code. SPS (the Standard Positioning Service) is available to all receivers, and uses the L1 carrier wave only; whereas PPS (the Precision Positioning Service) is available to authorised users (the military), using both the L1 and the L2 carrier waves. The use of 2 separate carrier waves (on 2 separate frequencies) is very helpful, as the 2 different waves will be affectedly differently by ionospheric propagation effects as they travel through the atmosphere (which is a large source of GNSS error), and the difference between the two waves can used to extrapolate a very accurate range sphere from the satellite, causing very accurate positioning from the GNSS system by almost completely removing one of the largest errors, ionospheric propagation. This is not something that the SPS can do, using only the signal on L1 frequency, there is no opportunity for signal comparison, so the receivers use a standard model of ionospheric propagation, which can correct for ionospheric errors somewhat, but is not as precise as having two signals to compare. Note: This is quite old technology now, and civilians have access to other frequencies also these days such as L2C and L5, not just L1. EASA, however, only recognise this old system, described above, which is actually very useful for us as the modern usage is far more complex to understand.",

            "explanation": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a 10 ns timing error might imply a 3m pseudorange error. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric and Tropospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 75 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors are caused by temperature, density, pressure or humidity changes. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building ( The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error.",

Learning Objective 062.06.01.02.24: State that agreements have been concluded between the appropriate agencies for the compatibility and interoperability by any approved user of NAVSTAR and GLONASS systems. Learning Objective 062.06.01.02.25: State that the different GNSSs use different data with respect to reference systems, orbital data, and navigation services. GPS and GLONASS are both GNSS systems, so operate in pretty much the same way, by using timed signals from satellites at known locations to work out multiple distance spheres, and thereby allow a receiver to work out its location. For aviation purposes, GPS is usually used in Europe and the Americas, but GLONASS is mostly used by Russia and their allies. They both operate over the whole world as they are global navigation systems, and they are NOT compatible with each other, neither by acting as extra satellites for the other, nor by augmenting the signals of the other like SBAS might. From our own knowledge on this, the two systems can actually be used together, but they will not \"work together\". There is some \"translation\" that has to occur to make them interoperable. For instance, if you've used a non-aviation Garmin device before, you might have seen that you can choose to use GPS only or GPS + GLONASS. One of the problems is that they use different reference systems, GPS uses WGS-84 and GLONASS uses PZ-90. Theoretically, using them both side-by side and mathematically converting the final product between the reference systems seems like the best way to use them both together at the moment, but this is not an aviation application of the two technologies yet, as far as we can tell.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, detected by a network of ground antennas, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. This can bring the time of a loss of integrity alert from a potential 3 hours down to just 6 seconds. This is far more acceptable for precision approaches, etc. Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites; on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite.",

The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudo-range or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudo-range’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it difficult to predict the exact induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Within the NAV message of standard GPS, one of the pieces of data that is downloaded to the receiver is a ionospheric model, based on an 11 year solar cycle, which can help the receiver drastically reduce the ionospheric error that affects the position fix.",

            "explanation": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) are navigational systems that employ the use of many satellites orbiting the Earth (24 is a technical minimum). Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnet messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals. There are multiple different GNSS systems in use around the world, NAVSTAR/GPS was initially created by the US, followed by GLONASS by the USSR/Russia, and now Galileo for Europe, and Beidou for China. They all have variations on each other, but use the same basic principle described above. It will be no surprise to anyone that these systems were initially designed for military use, and then released to the general public for (albeit less accurate) global usage. For Instance, GPS and Galileo use the WGS-84 ellispsoid reference system for position referencing, whereas GLONASS uses PZ-90.",

SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over very wide area. The satellites involved have geosynchronous orbits, meaning that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area.

Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors through the many ground stations and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. EGNOS is Europe's SBAS, and it contains up to 4 geo-stationary satellites (but deactivated one in 2019 so are running with 3 at the moment; 2 active, 1 in testing mode). These provide SBAS to Europe, and have the capability to provide it to Africa and the Middle East as well. Only 1 satellite is required to provide full coverage, hence the 2 active satellites in case of failure. Due to the other options here, it is best to go through the answers one by one: \"EGNOS uses at least 1 geostationary satellite to transmit to aircraft integrity and safety related messages.\" Yes, only 1 satellite is required, that section is correct. However, they don't transmit safety related messages other than integrity messages, therefore we would argue this is not completely correct. \"EGNOS uses up to 2 geostationary satellites to transmit ranging signals in the L2 frequency.\" No, it uses between 1 and 4 satellites, and transmits on L1 and L5. \"EGNOS uses at least 3 geostationary satellites to transmit receiver clock error and integrity data.\" No, same as above. \"EGNOS uses up to 4 geostationary satellites to transmit to aircraft integrity data and ranging signals.\" This is completely correct, EGNOS uses up to 4 satellites and does transmit integrity data and ranging signals to aircraft.

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through detection of errors and the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. An integrity warning is sent after just 6 seconds when using SBAS, but is up to 3 hours when using standard GNSS only. Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. This can then be turned into a distance measurement. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems. Not only this, but more modern GNSS receivers can also pick up very slight changes in signal frequency that occur due to the doppler effect. The doppler effect is where waves (electromagnetic in this case) have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart. As we know the exact frequency that the signal should be (L1 is 1575.42 MHz), and any expected movement of the satellites, our receiver can calculate its own ground speed using the combined doppler effect of all the satellites in view.",

Ephemeris: data which is used to correct the orbital almanac data of the satellite.

UTC parameters is used to determine the correction the receiver needs to turn the GPS time which it works on into UTC time so it can display to the pilot.

Selective Availability (SA) is included in the User Equivalent Range Error (UERE). Selective Availability. Selective Availability (SA) was a deliberate measure introduced by the U. S. Department of Defense in the mid-1990s to intentionally degrade the accuracy of civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. This degradation reduced the precision of civilian GPS fixes to around 100 meters. SA was achieved by introducing random errors in the satellite clock times, known as dithering SV clock time. In 2000, the U. S. government discontinued SA, ensuring significantly improved accuracy for civilian GPS users and assuring that it would not be reintroduced. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Tropospheric Errors or Delays. Due to the inherent precision of satellite-based navigation systems, changes in tropospheric conditions have a notable impact on the transmission of radio waves. Fluctuations in factors like pressure, temperature, density, and humidity influence the velocity of signal propagation. Greater density and higher absolute humidity result in decreased signal propagation speed. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

The ionosphere is named for its abundance of ions, which are electrically charged particles formed when atoms in the atmosphere are stripped of one or more electrons by solar radiation. The ionosphere can cause the GNSS signals to slow down as they pass through it due to its varying density and composition. This delay leads to variations in the signal path length, which in turn can introduce errors in the determination of positions by GNSS receivers. These errors are particularly significant for signals traveling through higher frequencies, such as those used by GNSS systems that use the UHF frequency band. Receiver clock error, signal multipath, and Dilution of Precision (DoP) are influenced by other factors such as the accuracy of the receiver's clock, reflections of signals from surrounding objects, and geometric relationships between satellites and the receiver's position, respectively.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a pseudo-range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals.",

The commonly used frequency bands are L1 and L2, with frequency of 1575.42 MHZ and 1228 MHZ, where L1 is an open civil signal and the signal is circular polarization. Therefore, the GPS jammer in the market is mainly aimed at these two signal frequencies. The signal strength is -166dbw, which is a weak signal. These features determine the preparation of specialized antennas for the reception of GPS signals. The global positioning system (GPS) has been used to support a wide variety of applications, such as high-accuracy positioning and navigation. Differential GPS techniques can largely eliminate common-mode errors between the reference and the rover GPS stations resulting from ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and delays, satellite and receiver clock biases, and orbital errors. The ionospheric delay in the propagation of global positioning system (GPS) signals is one of the main sources of error in GPS precise positioning and navigation. A dual-frequency GPS receiver can eliminate (to the first order) the ionospheric delay through a linear combination of the L1 and L2 observations. Note: The most significant effect of ionospheric delay appear in case of using single frequency data.",

It is currently 18 seconds. 3) Satellite time - A little more complicated, satellite time is the timing within each individual satellite clock. GNSS satellites have 4 separate atomic clocks for immensely accurate time monitoring. These do have miniscule natural errors in themselves, but also have a much larger error due to special and general relativity. To try not to go into too much detail, as the clocks are travelling very fast all the time, a phenomenon called time dilation occurs which makes the satellite clocks tick slower than on Earth, however, the gravitational difference causes an even larger effect that makes the satellite clocks tick faster overall. (The film 'Interstellar' shows the first effect very well). The Satellite clocks tick about 38 microseconds faster than Earth based clocks per day. This error accumulates over time, and is corrected for by the Satellite Clock Correction, also sent in the error message. Microseconds and even nanoseconds are very important to GPS accuracy, as the whole principle is based on accurate time measurements. If the Satellite Clock Correction becomes more than 1 millisecond, the Control Segment resets the satellite clocks to the exact GPS time, and the drifting can begin again.",

The GBAS can also give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect any such faults at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 20 NM (30 km according to the old syllabus) away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. SBAS - SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over a much wider area than GBAS can do. Their geosynchronous orbits mean that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. SBAS works in a very similar way to GBAS, but the reference antennas send their corrections to a master control station, which communicates the wide area corrections to the geostationary satellites for effective distribution over their large usable area. SBAS can also give integrity warnings in the same way that GBAS can, bringing the alerting time down from a potential 3 hours for standard GNSS to 6 seconds for SBAS users.",

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 20,000 km. The system was originally developed by the US government for military navigation but now anyone with a GPS device, be it a SatNav, mobile phone or handheld GPS unit, can receive the radio signals that the satellites broadcast. Wherever you are on the planet, at least four GPS satellites are ‘visible’ at any time. Each one transmits information about its position and the current time at regular intervals. These signals, travelling at the speed of light, are intercepted by your GPS receiver, which calculates how far away each satellite is based on how long it took for the messages to arrive. Once it has information on how far away at least three satellites are, your GPS receiver can pinpoint your location using a process called trilateration. This system consists of three segments: the space segment, the control segment, and the user segment. The U. S. Air Force develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments. Space Segment The space segment consists of a nominal constellation of 24 operating satellites that transmit one-way signals that give the current GPS satellite position and time. Control Segment The control segment consists of worldwide monitor and control stations that maintain the satellites in their proper orbits through occasional command maneuvers, and adjust the satellite clocks. It tracks the GPS satellites, uploads updated navigational data, and maintains health and status of the satellite constellation. User Segment The user segment consists of the GPS receiver equipment, which receives the signals from the GPS satellites and uses the transmitted information to calculate the user's three-dimensional position and time.",

This can be confused with the \"segments\" of GNSS and SBAS, of which there are 3, the ground segment, the space segment, and the user segment. SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over very wide area.

Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors through the many ground stations and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include monitoring stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station which processes the data. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections, and detect any errors with the GNSS signals as soon as they occur.",

GNSS has natural errors and problems which make it unsuitable for precise procedures such as precision approaches. It is fine for en-route navigation and departures/arrivals in most cases, but approaches are more demanding. For this reason, GNSS avionics used in IFR operations should augment the GNSS signal to ensure, among other things, its integrity. To accomplish this, on top of the raw GNSS signal, augmentation systems are employed, which usually are: Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). Often referred to as the Local Area Augmentation (LAAS), due to it's American origin. LAAS/GBAS systems measure the local GNSS signal and broadcast a signal which is used to fix any errors via a VHF datalink to nearby aircraft. LAAS enables ILS-like precision approaches to be flown by aircraft. These type of approaches are commonly called GLS (GBAS Landing system) approaches. It makes the aircraft GNSS systems extremely accurate and gives them excellent integrity monitoring. Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS). SBAS over the US is called the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). SBAS is a similar system to GBAS (above), which uses geostationary satellites to broadcast wide area GNSS signal fixes, provided by receivers and a control station on the ground. In Europe this is called EGNOS. => Given the American terminology used by this question, we assume that the question asks from a point of view of GNSS theory only, therefore WAAS and LAAS is the correct option. The question also is worded in a very misleading way, so is important to read properly and remember for the exam. The current feedback supports the wording and and answer we have shown. Any further exam feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or put in the comments. Thank you.",

It is also called \"differential GPS\", and can correct for errors induced by satellite clocks, ephemeris and ionospheric propogation to make the augmented GNSS signal very accurate. These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas and interpretted by a ground station, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. Errors in the receiver, multipath signals, and some small atmospheric propogation errors can still occur, but the intention is to get the accuracy below 1m for aircraft on final approach. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The GBAS positioning service is a terminal version of GBAS, and is useful for high accuracy navigation and fast integrity monitoring in the terminal areas around airports.",

This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). The amount of required satellites can be reduced by 1 for 2D fixes, but these are uncommon, unless barometric altitude is fed to the GNSS system, which can allow an extra \"range sphere\", and effectively acts like another satellite.

The Master Control Station (MCS) processes the measurements received by the Monitor Stations (MS) to estimate satellite orbits (ephemerides) and clock errors, among other parameters, and to generate the navigation message. These corrections and the navigation message are uploaded to the satellites through the Ground Antennas, which are co-located in four of the Monitor stations (Ascension Island, Cape Canaveral, Diego Garcia, and Kwajalein). The main tasks performed by the CS are the following: Monitoring and control of satellite orbital parameters; Monitoring health and status of the satellite subsystems (solar arrays, battery power and the level of propellant used for maneuvers); Activation of spare satellites; Update of parameters in the navigation message (ephemeris, almanac and clock corrections); Resolving satellite anomalies; Controlling Selective Availability (SA) and Anti-Spoofing (A/S) Passive tracking of the satellites.",

Then the USSR developed GLONASS, followed by more recently (and partly still in production), Europe's \"Galileo\" system and China's \"Beidou\" system. The other items listed in the questions are satellite based augmentation systems, which improve GNSS accuracy and integrity, but are not part of the GNSS systems themselves.

S. Department of Defense Today's GPS aeronautical receivers are extremely accurate due to their parallel multi-channel design. Parallel-channel receivers typically have between 5 and 12 receiver circuits, each devoted to one particular satellite signal, so strong locks can be maintained on all the satellites in view at all times. Parallel-channel receivers are quick to lock onto satellites when first turned on and they maintain strong locks even in dense foliage or urban settings with tall buildings.",

GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30 km away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future.

The commonly used frequency bands are L1 and L2, with frequency of 1575.42MHZ and 1228MHZ, where L1 is an open civil signal and the signal is circular polarization. Therefore, the GPS jammer in the market is mainly aimed at these two signal frequencies. The signal strength is -166dbw, which is a weak signal. These features determine the preparation of specialized antennas for the reception of GPS signals. The global positioning system (GPS) has been used to support a wide variety of applications, such as high-accuracy positioning and navigation. Differential GPS techniques can largely eliminate common-mode errors between the reference and the rover GPS stations resulting from ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and delays, satellite and receiver clock biases, and orbital errors. The ionospheric delay in the propagation of global positioning system (GPS) signals is one of the main sources of error in GPS precise positioning and navigation. A dual-frequency GPS receiver can eliminate (to the first order) the ionospheric delay through a linear combination of the L1 and L2 observations. Note: The most significant effect of ionospheric delay appear in case of using single frequency data.",

However, the LOs is incorrect. The contents of the navigation message from NAVSTAR/GPS include all six: Almanac data: data that describes the orbital courses of the satellites. Every satellite will broadcast almanac data for each satellite. Almanac data includes a set of parameters for each GPS satellite that can be used to calculate its approximate location in orbit. Ephemeris: data which is used to correct the orbital almanac data of the satellite. Satellite clock correction parameters: Despite the high stability of the clocks carried by the GPS, differences in synchronization still exist between the time transmitted by the satellite and the GPS time. Therefore, it is necessary to provide correction of the satellite clock error. UTC parameters is used to determine the correction the receiver needs to turn the GPS time which it works on into UTC time so it can display to the pilot. Satellite health/status data: data used to exclude signals from unhealthy satellites from position calculation. Ionospheric model: data which is used to calculate a time delay of the GPS signal travelling through the ionosphere.",

SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over very wide area. The satellites involved have geostationary orbits, meaning that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. As previously mentioned, EGNOS is the european SBAS, and provides its service using the normal L1 frequency band, the same as the C/A signal for GPS, but obviously contains different data such as the range modifications for each satellite and any integrity and availability messages. SBAS also allows its geostationary satellites to provide another GNSS signal for extra availability, also on that frequency. The 5 digit code that is individual to each approach procedure is just an identifier code to tell the system which procedure you will be doing, it does not change the frequency band that is picked up. It is important to note that just because SBAS uses the same frequency band as GPS, receivers are not automatically capable of receiving and processing the extra information provided.",

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. This question, however, is much simpler than upon initial inspection, as it is just asking about how many satellites we require for a 3D position, which is 4 satellites. Standard GNSS relies on satellites transmitting a timing signal (called the PRN signal) with exact timing data included, so that the receiver can measure this against the known time, and calculate a distance from all the satellites within view. Then a process called trilateration is used to determine the exact position of the receiver from multiple ranges from satellites of known locations (which creates multiple range spheres around the satellites, and the receiver is where the faces of all spheres meet [annex 2 above]). The GBAS signal does not require any more or less satellite ranges than this, as 4 is sufficient to perform its job (RAIM and geostationary satellites are not required for GBAS). More satellites are usually more accurate, but with GBAS, the accuracy is extremely high anyway, so it does not make much difference.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station.

SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches, to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200 ft.

Because the speed of light is known, the time it takes for the signal to reach a ground-based receiver can be used to calculate the distance from the satellite. Galileo’s timing needs to be accurate to the scale of nanosecond so this distance can be derived to a very high degree of certainty. Combine inputs from several satellites simultaneously and the receiver’s place in the world is pinpointed: Galileo’s aim is to deliver accuracy in the metre range once the full system is completed. Each satellite is equipped with two indipendent, non-identical atomic clocks, all of them are based on regular oscillations (traditionally the swing of a pendulum, tick of clockwork or pulse of quartz crystal). Highly accurate atomic clocks rely on switches between energy states of an atom’s electron shell, induced by light, laser or maser energy – if you force atoms to jump from one particular energy state to another, it will radiate an associated microwave signal at an extremely stable frequency. Note: The passive hydrogen maser clock is the master clock on board each satellite. It is an atomic clock which uses the ultra stable 1.4 GHz transition in a hydrogen atom to measure time to within 0.45 nanoseconds over 12 hours.",

For a receiver to work correctly, it must be able to \"see\" 4 satellites, in that the signals from the satellites are line-of-sight only, and therefore cannot go over the horizon or through mountains, thick obstructions, etc. 4 satellites give enough \"pseudorange\" rings to get a suitable fix in 3D space of a receiver's position. Within low and mid latitudes there are usually more than 4 satellites in view of any receiver, however, as you get closer to the poles, the satellites in view become fewer and quickly drop below the 4 required. Extra range can be gained when at high altitude, as the horizon is much less restrictive there. This reinforces the (nicely vague) answer of this question, that the \"visibility varies dependent on the time and position of the receiver\". It is not always best at the equator, nor is it the same everywhere around the globe.",

The GPS receivers generate code pseudorange to determine the user’s position. They also monitor changes in signal frequency to produce a rate of change of range measurements to determine velocity. The time between the transmission of the signal and its arrival at the receiver is measured. The transmitter-to-receiver distance can then be obtained by scaling the signal transit time by the speed of light. Using the concept of trilateration, a GPS receiver can determine its position using the measured travel time along with the satellites’ locations that are obtained from the navigation message carried by the signal. Though three satellites can be used to determine the user’s position, at least four are required owing to an additional estimation of the receiver clock offset. Using four satellites to find the position improves the accuracy of the solution by eliminating the receiver clock offset. The first and second user-to-satellite range measurements define two spheres on two different satellites, and the intersection of these two spheres defines a circle of possible receiver positions. A third range measurement, intersecting with the first two, narrows those receiver positions to an ambiguous pair, while the fourth measurement resolves this ambiguity and determines the clock bias.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.04: State that ionospheric delay is the most significant error. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Ionospheric errors are the greatest errors affecting GNSS accuracy. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. The term \"User Equivalent Range Error (UERE)\" is the combination of all satellite and SiS (Signal-in-Space) errors, and includes all GNSS errors except for Dilution of Precision, which is a different type of error.",

Each fix excludes 1 satellite, so the receiver knows if they are all correct or not, as they will all be correct if all the positions are the same, thereby noticing if any one satellite becomes faulty, as all the separate fixes will then be different from each other. This can tell us within 6 seconds if one of the satellites that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed by the master station and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD). If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which one is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). RAIM does not require anything more than a RAIM capable reciever and enough standard GNSS satellites to perform its integrity monitoring. It is a type of Air Based Augmentation System (ABAS), the other of which is called Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM), which uses onboard location data such as IRS and barometric altimeter information to verify the integrity of the GNSS position. AAIM can actually assist RAIM, if the two systems are suitably paired, and can allow for one less satellite to be required in some cases (2D fix).",

Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and does a very similar job to GBAS, just over a much wider area. Their geosynchronous orbits mean that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. This means that SBAS can reduce the notice time of a failure from a potential 3 hours (standard GPS) to only 6 seconds (SBAS). Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate GNSS range corrections over a very wide area. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches (1-2 m horizontally and 3-5 m vertically), to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. Any GNSS system (GPS/NAVSTAR in this question) has three segments, a control segment, a space segment and a user segment. This question asks about one of the main functions of the space segment, which is primarily there to transmit the signals that the receivers use to calculate their positions with. Not only positions, but also the exact time is sent in every transmission and the velocity of the receiver can be calculated by measuring the doppler shift of the frequencies. The satellites do not perform position calculations for us, and our receivers do not make any replies to the satellites. Nor do the satellites do their own orbital tracking and corrections, that is controlled by the control segment, and the master station on the ground.",

Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.01: List the most significant factors that affect accuracy: ionospheric propagation delay; dilution of precision; satellite clock error; satellite orbital variations; multipath. Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.02: State that a user equivalent range error (UERE) can be computed from all these factors. URE (User Range Error) is a collection of signal errors that cause GNSS inaccuracies. URE just contains all the errors except receiver errors and dilution of precision (DOP). There is another similar measure called UERE (User Equivalent Range Error) which also contains the receiver errors, but not DOP. LONG EXPLANATION Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. Multiple pseudoranges allow a process called trilateration to give a receiver its location. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Multipath error Receiver quality Dilution Of Precision (DOP) *Errors in Bold above are part of the URE (User Range Error) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. The navigation message includes ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. The almanac also gives the rough expected positions of the satellites in the future. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

Airborne-Based Augmentation System (ABAS) To meet the ICAO requirements for navigation, the GPS system needs to be augmented by using ground-based and space-based augmentation systems. This improves accuracy and provides necessary integrity and timely alerts. A third augmentation system, the Airborne-based Augmentation Aystem (ABAS) is used at the level of the aircraft and comes in two types, which are used together. The first type is the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), which is a stand-alone integrity control by the receiver based on the redundancy and geometry of GPS satellite vehicles. Note that RAIM provides integrity but does not improve the stand-alone GPS accuracy. The second type is the Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM), which is also a stand-alone integrity control. It is based on the combination of GPS signals with other sensors such as radio navigation (Rad Nav) facilities and/or inertial navigation systems (IRS).",

Taking a look at the learning objective above, we can see that a 25 NM final is outside of the maximum 20 NM range of the minimum software designed coverage area of the GBAS landing system (GLS) approach. In fact, GBAS is only effective out to a range of 20 NM from the airport due to its highly localised augmentation. Therefore, accepting a vector to a 25 NM final is not technically allowed, as for a few miles, the aircraft does not have any approved navigation. In reality, the GNSS system would allow the pilots to intercept the inbound course themselves and then fully intercept the GLS approach once inside the coverage area, but from a technical and legal standpoint, this is not allowed.",

Therefore, the only possible GNSS error caused by the ionosphere is \"longer path length\". SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with these ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. These ions alter the transmission time of satellite signals and can cause significant satellite position errors (typically ±5 meters). Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems This timing data does also mean that our receiver always has the exact time reference. Not only this, but more modern GNSS receivers can also pick up very slight changes in signal frequency that occur due to the doppler effect. The doppler effect is where waves (electromagnetic in this case) have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart. As we know the exact frequency that the signal should be (L1 is 1575.42 MHz), and any expected movement of the satellites, our receiver can calculate its own ground speed using the combined doppler effect of all the satellites in view.",

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude. These 3D approaches conducted in the vertical plane based on barometric reference require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. Barometric descents are prone to effects of the atmospheric parameters affecting altimetry: It is crucial to have the correct QNH altimeter setting to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. This is what ATC have given you previously, and they will update you if it changes (just change it in the system, no need to go-around) Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. The majority of RNP approaches will have an OAT minimum temperature limit, and the approach plate will state ‘uncompensated BARO-VNAV not authorised below X°C’. In this case, that limit is -8°C, and it is very likely that this is what caused ATC to call for a go-around, as the OAT was only 2°C warmer during the last ATIS. In this case, the baro-VNAV profile is now out of limits, and the approach is no longer legal.",

LNAV/VNAV uses a barometric VNAV system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower, as low as 200ft (ILS CAT I) due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - gained by using SBAS augmentation. LNAV, LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches are all the same type, RNP APCH. They just operate to different minima, depending on which system is being used.",

Please take note that the term \"terminal\" does not encompass the approach phase. Regarding lateral and angular performances, the limitations of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) are as follows: For oceanic/remote, en-route, and terminal operations, PBN is restricted to operations with linear lateral performance requirements and time constraints. This includes situations such as estimated time overhead (ETO). Due to historical reasons tied to the previous Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concept, PBN is presently constrained to operations with linear lateral performance requirements and time constraints.

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the horizontal approach guidance is based on GNSS and the vertical approach guidance is provided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude. In these 3D approaches, the vertical plane relies on barometric reference, necessitating the certification of altimeters with sufficient accuracy for a successful approach. However, barometric descents are susceptible to atmospheric variations that affect altimetry. Having the correct QNH altimeter setting is critical to avoid altitude discrepancies during the final approach. Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. The majority of RNP approaches will have an OAT minimum temperature limit, and the approach plate will state ‘uncompensated BARO-VNAV not authorised below X°C’. Cold temperatures make the actual aircraft altitude lower than the indicated. Since the aircraft is actually executing a lower approach than normal, the glide path angle will be less than normal.",

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altimeter, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude. For aircraft using baro-VNAV without temperature compensation to conduct the approach, low temperature limits are reflected in the procedure design and identified along with any high temperature limits on the charted procedure. Baro-VNAV approaches require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. While executing this type of approaches, we should take the following into account: It is crucial to set the correct QNH on the altimeter, to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. QNH is given by ATC, and updates are also given if it changes. Temperature values affect terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. In this case, that limit is -8°C, and it is unlikely that this is what caused ATC to call for a go-around, as the OAT was 10°C. Since temperature was not the cause of a low approach (it was higher than the minimum required), the pilot may have entered a wrong altimeter setting which led the aircraft being lower than indicated.",

The improved GPS position provides both lateral and vertical guidance and it is regarded as a precision approach. 3. RNP APCH (LNAV minima) is a non-precision approach, there is not vertical guidance. 4. RNP 1 is a navigation specification that requires aircraft to maintain lateral total system error within 1 NM for at least 95% of the flight time. It is not an approach at all.

Concept and Implementation Guidance 5.5 Offset flight path RNAV systems may provide the capability for the flight crew to specify a lateral offset from a defined route. Generally, lateral offsets can be specified in increments of 1 NM up to 20 NM. When a lateral offset is activated in the RNAV system, the RNAV aircraft will depart the defined route and typically intercept the offset at a 45 degree or less angle. When the offset is cancelled, the aircraft returns to the defined route in a similar manner. Such offsets can be used both strategically, i.e. fixed offset for the length of the route, or tactically, i.e. temporarily. Most RNAV systems discontinue offsets in the terminal area or at the beginning of an approach procedure, at an RNAV hold, or during course changes of 90 degrees or greater. The amount of variability in these types of RNAV operations should be considered as operational implementation proceeds (",

However, the examiner seems to think differently. We would appreciate any feedback you have. Fly-by turns are a key characteristic of an RNAV flight path. The RNAV system uses information on aircraft speed, bank angle, wind, and track angle change, to calculate a flight path turn that smoothly transitions from one path segment to the next. However, because the parameters affecting the turn radius can vary from one plane to another, as well as due to changing conditions in speed and wind, the turn initiation point and turn area can vary. Fly-over turn is not generally compatible with RNP flight tracks and will only be used when there is no requirement for repeatable paths or for the MAPt.

Learning Objective 062.07.04.02.06: State that on-board performance monitoring and alerting of path definition error is managed by gross reasonableness checks of navigation data. Paraphrased from ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual). The inability to achieve the required lateral navigation accuracy may be due to navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors in the context of on-board performance monitoring and alerting are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE), and navigation system error (NSE), as These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE). (1) Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. (2) Flight Technical Error (FTE) relates to the air crew or autopilot’s ability to follow the defined path or track, including any display error (e.g. course deviation indicator (CDI) centring error). (3) Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. The navigation accuracy of the whole system depends on the TSE. An RNP system requires on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which includes the system making a judgement about the potential errors at any one time. Some errors are easier to judge than others, and the system usually produces something called the ANP (Actual Navigation Performance), or EPE (Estimated Position Error), and alerts the pilots also if this becomes less accurate than the required position accuracy. The EPE is calculated through quite a complex process of measuring other navigational data, using anticipated inaccuracies for that section of routing, any expected GNSS and IRS errors for that point in flight. Statistically it works very well to tell us when we are outside of the required navigational performance (RNP) for more than the acceptable 5% window (we must be within the RNP for 95% of the time). It is important to note that no singular navigational aid is perfect, so there is no \"ultimate reference\", and multiple have to be checked for the EPE to be calculated effectively.",

The ANP is calculated so that we are within such a navigational performance 95% or more of the time.

Effects of Cold Temperature on Baro-vertical Navigation (VNAV) Vertical Guidance Non-standard temperatures can result in a change to effective vertical paths and actual descent rates when using aircraft baro-VNAV equipment for vertical guidance on final approach segments. A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. This is because a parcel of air loses pressure with height at a higher rate when cold, so set \"pressure columns\" are smaller in cold air and taller in warm air, Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate.

            "explanation": "RNP 2 is a navigation specification as part of PBN (Performance Based Navigation). RNP 2 can be used for en-route continental and en-route oceanic/remote continental. It is therefore very versatile, but also quite accurate, having a required accuracy 95% of the time of only 2 nm. The question and options are quite vague, but in that case, it is sometimes best to go as vague as possible. Let us consider the 4 options. \"The aircraft and the crew must be approved to fly in RNP 2 airspace.\" Both the aircraft, equipment and crew must be suitably approved to fly under any navigation specification. This airspace requires the use of RNP 2, so the crew and the aircraft must be certified to fly under RNP 2. \"The pilot must confirm that they are able to maintain the required lateral accuracy along the route.\" This is quite close to being correct, but we think that \"all of the route\" is indicating that the aircraft must be within the required accuracy for 100% of the time, which is not correct. RNAV and RNP specifications require an aircraft to be within the required navigational performance 95% or more of the time. This is to deal with minor anomalies and statistical margins. Also, in many cases, the pilot will not be able to confirm that they are able to meet the accuracy, as unforseen circumstances can occur. \"The pilot and aircraft must be certified for RNP 2, RNP 1 or RNP 0.3.\" These are totally different RNP specifications, and aircraft and crew must be certified for the exact specification they will be using. \"The equipment must comply to RNAV2/RNP2 specifications.\" The difference between RNAV and RNP is the need for on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which RNP requires, but RNAV does not. Other than that, they are very similar. However, these two specifications are different, so we cannot just say RNAV/RNP 2 as if they are the same specification. Note: Due to the broken feedback of this question, we are relying on further feedback from other students to modify and verify both the question and options present.

Let's go through each option: Communications Failure - whilst it is a concern, a communications failure is not a cause for an immediate go-around. Logically, you have to land eventually, so you will have to do it without comms at some point. Other regulations in place to cover this eventuality for all approaches, not just RNP approaches A TCAS RA is always a cause to go around, as it will require an action from the aircraft that does not allow an approach to be continued. Position fix differs from other instruments - This could be as much the other instruments as it could be the RNP system, and RNP approaches have built in accuracy and integrity monitoring, to make sure the correct position data is used. If the actual navigational accuracy is not good enough for the procedure, then the procedure must be discontinued, as the aircraft cannot be sure enough of its position to safely continue descent. The wording for this section of the question is very bad, they mean that if ANP (actual navigation performance) exceeds RNP (required navigation performance), that this is a bad thing, as we are not as accurate as we need to be.

ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual) 5.3.3.1.5.1.2 After sequencing the FAP and during operations on the FAS of an RNP APCH operation down to LP or LPV minima: a) the aircraft navigation equipment shall provide an alert within 6 seconds if the SIS errors causing a lateral position error are greater than 40 m, with a probability of 1-2.10-7 in any approach (Annex 10, Volume I, Table 3.7.2.4-1); and b) the aircraft navigation equipment shall provide an alert within 6 seconds if the SIS errors causing a vertical position error is greater than 50 m (or 35 m for LPV minima down to 200 ft), with a probability of 1-2.10-7 in any approach (Annex 10, Volume I, Table 3.7.2.4-1). SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over a much wider area than GBAS can do. The geosynchronous orbits of the SBAS satellites mean that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can increase signal availability, accuracy and integrity over a wide area. In particular for this question, integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network of ground antennas quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. The usual integrity of the Navstar/GPS system, for example, is up to 3 hours (before an alert will be sent out), but with SBAS used, the alerting time is just 6 seconds, making it acceptable for an approach. It is not just a failed satellite which is alerted, but if the GNSS signals become out of limits, this is also a loss of integrity, and would be alerted within the same 6 seconds. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches, to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. SBAS systems are even better than Baro-VNAV, and can make the GNSS signal acceptable for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

Therefore, RNP 1 is the correct specification to use in the terminal arrival phase of flight. With this, the Required Navigational Performance (RNP) is 1 NM laterally and longitudinally, and must be kept within this at least 95% of the time. When the aircraft enters the approach phase, the aircraft area navigation system must switch from RNP 1 to RNP APCH, unless it is specified as an AR(authorisation required) approach. Again, Advanced RNP is not part of this question as it is a type of multi-specification that would not need to switch between arrival and approach.

GBAS is used to improve GPS receiver position and intends to provide an alternative to ILS. The improved GPS position provides both lateral and vertical guidance and it is regarded as a precision approach. 3. PAR stands for Precision Approach Radar. It uses primary radar equipment to determine information of aircraft that includes distance to touch down, deviation from runway centreline and glide path. These data are used to aid the aircraft in the approach till touchdown. Therefore, it is a 3D approach since both later and vertical guidance are present. (Not to be confused with surveillance radar approach, which also uses primary radar equipment but only provides lateral guidance.) 4. RNP 1 is a navigation specification that requires aircraft to maintain lateral total system error within 1 NM for at least 95% of the flight time. It is not an approach at all. Not to be confused with RNP APRCH which includes GNSS for LNAV minimum, GNSS + Baro VNAV for LNAV/VNAV minimum and GNSS augmented by SBAS. 5. ILS stands for Instrument Landing System. It uses localiser for lateral guidance and glideslope and vertical guidance. 6. RNP APCH (SBAS) are approaches based on GNSS positioning augmented by SBAS (not to be confused with GBAS). If it is down to LP minima it is 2D approach. If it is down to LPV minima it is 3D approach. Since all choices include this option it should be referring to the LPV minima. Combining all the information above, all the options available are 3D approaches, except RNP 1. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.",

Navigation System Error (NSE) - The accuracy of the navigation system (comparing the estimated position to the true position). During specific phases of flight, such as Oceanic, Terminal, or Approach, the aircraft's ANP must remain below a specified value, which is the RNP (Required Navigation Performance). When the ANP is less than the RNP, it signifies that the aircraft's navigational accuracy meets or exceeds the required standards for that phase of flight, ensuring a high level of confidence in the aircraft's position. The ANP is calculated to ensure that this level of navigational performance is achieved at least 95% of the time. However, in situations where the ANP exceeds the RNP (indicating reduced navigational accuracy), the aircraft falls short of the necessary positional certainty for that specific procedure or airspace. This may have negative effects like stopping the crew from executing an RNP approach, or even from using some types of airspace. In this question, we are in the bad scenario where our ANP is greater than our RNP, so we do not meet the requirements for that procedure/airspace, we are out of limits.",

LNAV/VNAV is a 3D (APV - Approach with vertical guidance) approach, which allows for a Decision Height/Altitude to be used. For vertical navigation, it uses Barometric VNAV (Baro-VNAV) as a minimum (SBAS can also be used if approved by the authority). LPV is a 3D (APV) approach to minimums as low as 200ft, due to its higher accuracy and integrity, and narrowing lateral navigation. It uses SBAS augmentation onto te GNSS signal for high accuracy both laterally and vertically. Baro-VNAV is the topic of this question, and it has a couple of issues to overcome. It uses an onboard digital altimeter for vertical guidance, which must be: Set to the correct barometric pressure; and Be within temperature limits. This is because the altimeter suffers from the same effects as all altimeters, which are barometric and temperature discrepancies. If the temperature is too low outside, the altimeter will indicate higher than it actually is, meaning true altitude is too low, and the glide path is too low, reducing obstacle clearance. This is why approaches using baro-VNAV have a minimum temperature included on the approach chart, below which obstacle clearance is too low to make an approach without temperature correction. See annex above. A temperature correction system (which must be approved for use) can take the temperature and change the barometric inputs to the baro-VNAV accordingly, meaning that the aircraft's glide path follows the intended glide path, and that obstacle clearance is not compromised, even at very low temperatures. According to ICAO Doc 9613: \"Temperature compensation systems - Systems that provide temperature-based corrections to the barometric VNAV guidance must comply with RTCA/DO-236B, Appendix H.2. This applies to the FAS.\" In plain words, this means that the approved temperature correction systems apply to the final approach segment (FAS), as asked in this question.",

The strategic objectives which most commonly drive airspace concepts are safety, capacity, efficiency, access and the environment. For example: Safety: The design of RNP instrument approach procedures could be a way of increasing safety (by reducing Controlled Flights into Terrain (CFIT)). Capacity: Planning the addition of an extra runway at an airport to increase capacity will trigger a change to the airpsace concept (new approaches to SIDs and STAR required). Efficiency: A user requirement to optimize flight profiles on departure and arrival could make flights more efficient in terms of fuel burn. Environment: Requirements for reduced emissions, noise preferential routes or continuous descent/arrivals/approaches (CDA), are environmental motivators for change. Access: A requirement to provide an approach with lower minima than supported by conventional procedures, to ensure continued access to the airport during bad weather, may result in providing an RNP approach to that runway. The cascade effect from strategic objectives to the airspace concept places requirements on the various “enablers”, such as communication, navigation, ATS surveillance, air traffic management and flight operations.

These are known as APV approaches (Approaches with vertical guidance), and are 3D approaches that sit in between non-precision and precision approaches. LNAV/VNAV uses at least a barometric VNAV system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower still, as low as 200ft (ILS CAT I) due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - gained by using SBAS augmentation. You can of course use a better system for one of the less stringent approaches, such as using SBAS for an approach to LNAV/VNAV minima, as is being asked in this question. More recently, LNAV, LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches are all the same type, RNP APCH. They just operate to different minima, depending on which system is being used. Commonly confused is the GBAS Landing system (GLS), which is actually not a form of RNP APCH, and is a seperate type of precision approach, that just happens to use ground based augmentation on GNSS signals, a localised version of SBAS.",

Please send any further exam feedback to info@atplquestions.com or put them in the comments, thank you. RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude. These 3D approaches conducted in the vertical plane based on barometric reference require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. Barometric descents are prone to effects of the atmospheric parameters affecting altimetry: It is crucial to have the correct QNH altimeter setting to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. This means that the approach path flown by an aircraft would be shallower than expected, with a lower glide path angle. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. The majority of RNP approaches will have an OAT minimum temperature limit, and the approach plate will state ‘uncompensated BARO-VNAV not authorised below X°C’.",

These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE): Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. RNAV system is unable to accurately define the desired path. Path definition error (PDE) is constrained through database integrity and functional requirements on the defined path, and is considered negligible. Flight Technical Error (FTE) relates to the air crew or autopilot’s ability to follow the defined path or track, including any display error (e.g. course deviation indicator (CDI) centring error). Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. It is the error in the accuracy in determining actual aircraft coordinates.",

The RF leg is defined by radius, arc length, and fix.

Note.— Bank angle limits for different aircraft types and winds aloft are taken into account in procedure design. 5.2.2 The other form of the FRP is intended to be used with en-route procedures. Due to the technicalities of how the procedure data are defined, it falls upon the RNP system to create the fixed radius turn (also called a fixed radius transition or FRT) between two route segments ( 5.2.3 These turns have two possible radii, 22.5 NM for high altitude routes (above FL 195) and 15 NM for low altitude routes.

When the offset is cancelled, the aircraft returns to the defined route in a similar manner. Such offsets can be used both strategically, i.e. fixed offset for the length of the route, or tactically, i.e. temporarily. Most RNAV systems discontinue offsets in the terminal area or at the beginning of an approach procedure, at an RNAV hold, or during course changes of 90 degrees or greater.

The INS/IRS also takes some time to get its own systems aligned, and judge the Earth's rotation, find True North, etc. Depending on the system (old INS's take much longer and are less accurate), this takes 5-10 minutes in mid latitudes, and up to 17 minutes at high latitudes (>70º). The learning objectives (022-Instruments) say 10-20 minutes, but this is for the oldest INSs. In this case, we can use the standard figure of 10 minutes, where the aircraft is still, and the INS/IRSs can become aligned. It is usually under 10 minutes, but given that it mentions older INSs aswell, we can happily say 10 minutes.",

PBN exists under the umbrella of area navigation (RNAV). The term RNAV in this context, as in procedure titles, just means “area navigation,” regardless of the equipment capability of the aircraft. Within PBN there are two main categories of navigation methods or specifications: area navigation (RNAV) and required navigation performance (RNP). The term RNAV x means a specific navigation specification with a specified lateral accuracy value. For an aircraft to meet the requirements of PBN, a specified RNAV or RNP accuracy must be met 95 percent of the flight time. RNP is a PBN system that includes onboard performance monitoring and alerting capability (for example, Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)). PBN also introduces the concept of navigation specifications (NavSpecs) which are a set of aircraft and aircrew requirements needed to support a navigation application within a defined airspace concept. For both RNP and RNAV NavSpecs, the numerical designation refers to the lateral navigation accuracy in nautical miles which is expected to be achieved at least 95 percent of the flight time by the population of aircraft operating within the airspace, route, or procedure.",

These days, it is thankfully quite simple to think about this. All approaches which use GNSS are now part of the PBN specification \"RNP APCH\" (apart from GNSS overlay approaches {not covered} and GBAS {different section entirely}). RNP APCH can be used in 3 modes, down to 3 different approach minima. See the above approach chart for Nantes-Atlantique, and notice that there are different minima for LNAV, LNAV/VNAV and LPV. LNAV only is a non-precision approach (similar to a VOR approach) using GNSS. LNAV/VNAV uses GNSS plus a barometric VNAV* system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower, as low as 200ft (ILS CAT I) due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - is gained by using SBAS augmentation to the GNSS signal, it is also a 3D approach standard. *Baro-VNAV is the minimum that can be used, but there is \"backwards compatibility\" in RNP APCH, so the more accurate SBAS can be used to perform an approach down to LNAV/VNAV minima, if the state publishing the procedure allows it. The lowest level of accuracy is LNAV only, which is a non-precision approach, such as a VOR/DME approach",

When flying under an RNP (Required Navigation Performance) PBN specification, the navigation system is required to continuously calculate/estimate the Actual Navigation Performance (ANP), which is technically called the Total System Error (TSE), and is the geometric sum of the: Path Definition Error (PDE) - How closely the path in the FMS resembles the intended path. Flight Technical Error (FTE) - How closely the aircraft follows the path in the FMS. Navigation System Error (NSE) - The accuracy of the navigation system (difference between estimated position and true position). The TSE is estimated at all times during flight, and shown to the pilots as the ANP (or EPE, TSE, etc. depending on system). If the ANP is less accurate than the RNP for more than 5% of the time, the pilots will be alerted, and the navigation performance is not good enough to use that navigation specification. In terms of the wording of this question, the navigation \"accuracy\" is defined as the TSE, which is the difference between the intended (required) position and the true position.

The inability to achieve the required lateral navigation accuracy may be due to navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors in the context of on-board performance monitoring and alerting are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE), and navigation system error (NSE), as These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE). (1) Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground.

(3) Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. The navigation accuracy of the whole system depends on the TSE. An RNP system requires on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which includes the system making a judgement about the potential errors at any one time. Some errors are easier to judge than others, and the system usually produces something called the ANP (Actual Navigation Performance), or EPE (Estimated Position Error), which alerts the pilots also if this becomes less accurate than the required position. The Flight Management System (FMS) has an algorithm for calculating and making reasonable guesses and assumptions as to the amount of PDE, NSE and FTE at any time, and therefore can give us our actual accuracy readout.",

Using such path elements in an RNAV ATS route enables improvement in airspace usage through closely spaced parallel routes. SUMMARY Two types of fixed radius paths: Radius-to Fix legs (RF) - used in terminal or approach procedures (defined by radius, arc length and fix); Fixed Radius Transition (FRT) - used with en-route procedures.",

Paraphrased from ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual). The inability to achieve the required lateral navigation accuracy may be due to navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors in the context of on-board performance monitoring and alerting are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE), and navigation system error (NSE), as These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE). (1) Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. (2) Flight Technical Error (FTE) relates to the air crew or autopilot’s ability to follow the defined path or track, including any display error (e.g. course deviation indicator (CDI) centring error). (3) Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. The navigation accuracy of the whole system depends on the TSE. Technically there are some complex mathematical algorithms at work calculating the TSE from the 3 components, but it is effectively a mathematical addition of the 3 components with a thought given to the statistical accuracy of each. This is why ICAO produce the annex above, which shows the TSE as the addition of PDE, FTE and NSE. More information can be found in ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual) page II-A-2-1, but will most likely be above the level of the syllabus.",

ICAO Doc. 9613 (PBN Manual) 5.3.4.4.4 The procedure must be discontinued: a) if the navigation display is flagged invalid; or b) in case of LOI alerting function; or c) if integrity alerting function is annunciated not available before passing the FAF; or d) if FTE [Flight Technical Error] is excessive. Let's go through each option: \"The required RNP APCH mode fails to engage\" When an aircraft operates a flight using RNP (required navigation performance) specifications, the system must be certified for, and using, the correct specification for that phase of flight. An aircraft may be navigating via RNP 1 until the final approach fix, where it must change into the correct RNP approach mode. That could be RNP APCH, or a more specific name like LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, LPV, etc., depending on the aircraft and the approach minimums. If the aircraft does not lock into the correct approach mode, the accuracy is not assured and a missed approach must be made. \"Communications Failure\" Whilst it is a concern, a communications failure is not a cause for an immediate go-around. Logically, you have to land eventually, so you will have to do it without comms at some point. Other regulations in place to cover this eventuality for all approaches, not just RNP approaches. \"TCAS TA\" A TCAS TA (Traffic Advisory) is just where it shouts \"TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC\" at you, to make you aware. It is not a reason for a mandatory missed approach, but depending on the circumstances, a pilot may find it prudent to go-around. \"The actual navigation accuracy exceeds the required navigation accuracy\" If the actual navigational accuracy is not good enough for the procedure, then the procedure must be discontinued, as the aircraft cannot be sure enough of its position to safely continue descent. The wording for this section of the question is very bad, they mean that if ANP (actual navigation performance) exceeds RNP (required navigation performance), that this is a bad thing, as we are not as accurate as we need to be. \"The lateral deviation exceeds instrument full scale deflection\" If the aircraft is out of full scale deflection, an immediate missed approach should be made.",

In contrast, PBN requires an RNAV system that integrates raw navigation data to provide a positioning and navigation solution. In determining separation minima and route spacing in a PBN context, this integrated navigation performance “output” is used. Conclusion: Conventional radio navigation is based on raw data - indicating that the data comes first-handed from sensors.

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS SBAS altitude). These 3D approaches conducted in the vertical plane based on barometric reference require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. Barometric descents are prone to effects of the atmospheric parameters affecting altimetry: It is crucial to have the correct QNH altimeter setting to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with ICAO ISA. In case of low temperature, the layers move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. The majority of RNP approaches will have an OAT temperature limit, and the approach plate will state ‘uncompensated BARO-VNAV not authorised below X°C’.",

The aircraft type The aircraft type should not matter to PBN at all, it is about the systems on board and the availability of navigational data. 3. The navigation specification The navigation specification (RNP4, RNP1, RNP APCH, etc.) is a very important component of PBN operations, as this dictates what the minimum navigational accuracy is for a particular procedure/airspace. 4. Communications Communications play no part in PBN, as they cannot be used for navigation in this way. 5. The navigation application The navigation application refers to things like SIDs, STARs and approaches, which each require a particular navigation specification (or multiple). 6. ATS surveillance ATS surveillance has nothing to do with our aircraft's navigational accuracy, and PBN operations can be completed with or without it. 7.

In more simplified terms, it is asking; \"How do we measure when we are too far from the track (on approach) in linear operations vs angular operations?\" The answer is that when we are using linear operations, we have an indicator to tell us how far (distance, NM) we are from the desired track, and if we are further away than the given threshold, we cannot continue the procedure. With linear operations, the distance to the threshold stays the same (0.3 NM from the track, for example). When we are using angular operations, the CDI (course deviation indicator) shows a deviation related to the angle that we are off track, the same way a localiser does for a standard ILS approach. This means the approach becomes more sensitive (and the allowed distance off track becomes smaller) as we get closer to the runway. An angular deviation would be measured as a certain amount of degrees off track.",

Learning Objective 062.07.04.02.04: Explain how a navigation system assesses the EPE. SHORT EXPLANATION In short, the EPE is the Estimated Position Error, meaning that it is a calculation and an estimation (where precise values are not known) of how close the aircraft's true position is to its required position. The EPE tries to calculate the TSE (Total System Error) as closely as possible, but some values are impossible to know, so some estimations have to be made through statistical models and error distributions, along with measuring other systems. The TSE is the actual error, and is made up of 3 individual errors, PDE, FTE and NSE. FULL EXPLANATION Paraphrased from ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual). The inability to achieve the required lateral navigation accuracy may be due to navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors in the context of on-board performance monitoring and alerting are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE), and navigation system error (NSE), as These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE). (1) Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. (2) Flight Technical Error (FTE) relates to the air crew or autopilot’s ability to follow the defined path or track, including any display error (e.g. course deviation indicator (CDI) centring error). (3) Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. The navigation accuracy of the whole system depends on the TSE. An RNP system requires on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which includes the system making a judgement about the potential errors at any one time. Some errors are easier to judge than others, and the system produces something called the ANP (Actual Navigation Performance), or EPE (Estimated Position Error), and alerts the pilots also if this becomes less accurate than the required position accuracy. The EPE is calculated through quite a complex process of measuring other navigational data, using anticipated inaccuracies for that section of routing, any expected GNSS and IRS errors for that point in flight and statistical distributions of error to estimate the current TSE. Statistically it works very well to tell us when we are outside of the required navigational performance (RNP) for more than the acceptable 5% window (we must be within the RNP for 95% of the time). OTHER OPTIONS This part of PBN is pretty complex, so we can go through each option to evaluate why they are correct/wrong: \"The distance between the GNSS position and calculated actual position.\" The EPE is an estimation of the Total system error, not any one part of the error. Also, as this approach procedure is based on GNSS position (from the question, the GNSS position should be the calculated position (and not the \"actual\" position either). \"The correction applied to position when using an augmentation system.\" Whilst this approach may make use of augmentation of some kind, that would only change the GNSS reported position, and the FMS does not really care about this augmentation, nor is it a part of the system error, so certainly incorrect. \"A value calculated by using a statistical model of position error probabilities.\" Whilst this is a bit vague, it is all correct. The calculation of EPE is mathematically complex, and uses plenty of probabilistic estimations, such as gaussian distributions. This question is really asking for us to know that EPE is an estimation. \"An error calculated in the control segment and broadcast on the navigation message.\" This is talking about the control segment and navigation message of the GNSS system. No, the EPE is calculated/estimated internally within the aircraft navigation system.",

            "explanation": "Paraphrased from ICAO doc. 9613 (PBN Manual). The inability to achieve the required lateral navigation accuracy may be due to navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors in the context of on-board performance monitoring and alerting are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE), and navigation system error (NSE), as These errors are combined in a mathematical way to form the Total System Error (TSE). 1. Path Definition Error (PDE) occurs when the path defined in the RNAV system does not correspond to the desired path, i.e. the path expected to be flown over the ground. 2. Flight Technical Error (FTE) relates to the air crew or autopilot’s ability to follow the defined path or track, including any display error (e.g. course deviation indicator (CDI) centring error). 3. Navigation System Error (NSE) refers to the difference between the aircraft’s estimated position and actual position. The navigation accuracy of the whole system depends on the TSE. An RNP system requires on-board performance monitoring and alerting, which includes the system making a judgement about the potential errors at any one time. Some errors are easier to judge than others, and the system usually produces something called the ANP (Actual Navigation Performance), or EPE (Estimated Position Error), which alerts the pilots also if this becomes less accurate than the required accuracy.",

The PBN concept represents a shift from sensor-based to performance-based navigation. Performance requirements are identified in navigation specifications, which also identify the choice of navigation sensors and equipment that may be used to meet the performance requirements. PBN offers a number of advantages over the sensor-specific method of developing airspace and obstacle clearance criteria, i.e.: a) reduces the need to maintain sensor-specific routes and procedures, and their associated costs; b) avoids the need for developing sensor-specific operations with each new evolution of navigation systems, which would be cost-prohibitive; c) allows for more efficient use of airspace (route placement, fuel efficiency and noise abatement); d) clarifies how RNAV systems are used; and e) facilitates the operational approval process for operators by providing a limited set of navigation specifications intended for global use. In slightly simpler terms, the PBN concept of airspace moves away from being routed via particular nav-aids, or being limited by the nav-aids in a particular area, or on a particular aircraft. As PBN is not sensor-specific, all that is required is the correct accuracy, integrity, etc. to fly in particular airspace. It is far simpler, and easy to upgrade in future.",

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude). These approaches require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. Barometric descents are prone to atmospheric effects and altimetry: It is crucial to have the correct QNH altimeter setting to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. In this case, the OAT is nowhere near the lower limit of -8ºC, so either the OAT is wrong, which is unlikely, or the QNH has been inputted incorrectly into the avionics in the aircraft, meaning that the aircraft could be flying a much lower approach than it should be. ATC may notice this on their surveillance system and call for a go-around. Tip: This question can be solved very quickly by thinking of what ATC can see, for instance, they do not monitor satellites or RAIM (and we are not using GBAS) so the other 3 options cannot be correct.",

When a lateral offset is activated in the RNAV or RNP system, the aircraft will leave the defined route and typically intercept the offset at an angle of 45 degrees or less. When the offset is cancelled, the aircraft returns to the defined route in a similar manner. Such offsets can be used both strategically, i.e. fixed offset for the length of the route, or tactically, i.e. temporarily. Most RNAV and RNP systems automatically cancel offsets in the terminal area or at the beginning of an approach procedure, at an RNAV hold, or during course changes of 90 degrees or greater.

It is this concept that requires each specification eligibility to be listed separately in the avionics documents or AFM.

Furthermore, the differences include airspace and procedures which require different levels of accuracy, integrity, and availability (and continuity).

SPECIFIC RNAV AND RNP SYSTEM FUNCTIONS 5.1 Performance-based flight operations are based on the ability to assure reliable, repeatable and predictable flight paths for improved capacity and efficiency in planned operations. The implementation of performance-based flight operations requires not only the functions traditionally provided by the RNAV or RNP system, but also may require specific functions to improve procedures, and airspace and air traffic operations. The system capabilities for established fixed radius paths, RNAV or RNP holding, and lateral offsets fall into this latter category. 5.2 Fixed radius paths 5.2.1 The fixed radius paths (FRPs) take two forms: one is the radius to fix (RF) leg type. The RF leg is one of the leg types described that should be used when there is a requirement for a specific curved path radius in a terminal or approach procedure. The RF leg is defined by radius, arc length, and fix. RNP systems supporting this leg type provide the same ability to conform to the track-keeping accuracy during the turn as in the straight line segments. Note: Bank angle limits for different aircraft types and winds aloft are taken into account in procedure design. 5.2.2 The other form of the FRP is intended to be used with en-route procedures. Due to the technicalities of how the procedure data are defined, it falls upon the RNP system to create the fixed radius turn (also called a fixed radius transition or FRT) between two route segments ( 5.2.3 These turns have two possible radii, 22.5 NM for high altitude routes (above FL 195) and 15 NM for low altitude routes. Using such path elements in an RNAV ATS route enables improvement in airspace usage through closely spaced parallel routes. SUMMARY Two types of fixed radius paths: Radius-to Fix legs (RF) - used in terminal or approach procedures (defined by radius, arc length and fix); Fixed Radius Transition (FRT) - used with en-route procedures.",

PBN (Performance Based Navigation) refers to the concept of using \"area navigation - RNAV\", which allows an aircraft navigation system to know where it is, and be able to fly on tracks that do not need to go via ground-based nav-aids. This allows aircraft to fly more direct tracks, and greatly reduces traffic density in some major conventional airways, by creating new routes, not via ground nav-aids. Aircraft 1 is using PBN, allowing it to calculate its own location using multiple sources. These include GNSS, on-board IRSs, VORs and DMEs. These inputs are then computed into an estimated position, with a calculated level of accuracy (how certain the aircraft is of its position). We call this \"computed data\". Aircraft 2 from our scenario is not using PBN, however, and is instead navigating via conventional nav-aids, such as VORs, DMEs and NDBs. This is what we call \"raw data\" flying, as there is no internal calculations occurring, the pilot is doing any calculations themselves, and the avionics are just telling them pieces of \"raw data\" about their position relative to the ground nav-aids. This is more restrictive for where an aircraft can fly, and usually more complex for the pilots to fly as well.",

In PBN operations, two different types of navigation specification exist, RNAV (Area Navigation) and RNP (Required Navigation Performance). RNAV is mostly removed from operation these days, as RNP is a better system, with more capability (especially for approaches) and the requirement of on-board performance monitoring and alerting. What that means is that our actual navigation performance (ANP), sometimes called our Estimated Position Error (EPE), is constantly being calculated and statistically judged by our onboard flight management system. This accuracy is then measured up against the required navigation performance, and if the ANP is higher than the RNP (therefore ANP is less accurate than required), then the pilots will be alerted, and the aircraft is no longer capable of maintaining that RNP specification, which may stop them from using that airspace or completing the desired procedure. Note: the ANP is statistically the worst accuracy over 95% of the time, in order to allow for very brief fluctuations and some statistical margin.",

LNAV/VNAV minima based on BARO-VNAV – the approach horizontal guidance is managed based on GNSS and the vertical profile is guided by barometric altitude, as opposed to using GPS-SBAS altitude). These 3D approaches conducted in the vertical plane based on barometric reference require certification of altimeters with adequate accuracy to enable completion of the approach. Barometric descents are prone to effects of the atmospheric parameters affecting altimetry: It is crucial to have the correct QNH altimeter setting to avoid offset altitudes during final approach. Temperature effects also influence terrain clearance on final approach segment. Altimeters are calibrated in accordance with the international standard atmosphere (ISA). In case of low temperature, the pressure layers in the atmosphere move closer together resulting in a lower true altitude than indicated. Consequently, obstacle clearance minima may be jeopardised if temperatures are below a certain limit. The majority of RNP approaches will have an OAT minimum temperature limit, and the approach plate will state ‘uncompensated BARO-VNAV not authorised below X°C’. In this case, that limit is -8°C, and it is very likely that this is what caused ATC to call for a go-around, as the OAT was only 2°C warmer during the last ATIS.",

The RF leg is defined by radius, arc length, and fix. RNP systems supporting this leg type provide the same ability to conform to the track-keeping accuracy during the turn as in the straight line segments. 5.1.2 The other form of the fixed radius path is intended to be used with en-route procedures. Due to the technicalities of how the procedure data are defined, it falls upon the RNP system to create the fixed radius turn (also called a fixed radius transition or FRT) between two route segments ( 5.1.3 These turns have two possible radii, 22.5 NM for high altitude routes (above FL195) and 15 NM for low altitude routes. Using such path elements in an RNAV ATS route enables improvement in airspace usage through closely spaced parallel routes. RF leg type → terminal or approach procedures FRT → en-route procedures",
