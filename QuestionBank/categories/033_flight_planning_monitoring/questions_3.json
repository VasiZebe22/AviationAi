This is the closest available learning objective to this question, and even though none of the given options actually refer directly to the learning objective itself, it does give valuable guidance on which options to reject. All modern transport aircraft will have Flight Management Computers (FMCs) fitted. Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations. The normal calculation method is for the FMC to use actual wind to the next waypoint and pilot-inputted forecast winds beyond that. The actual wind is calculated using FMS position and groundspeed, heading (provided by the IRS or AHRS), and TAS (provided by the Air Data Computer, which is an outside input). The GNSS/FMC combination is not able to detect weather (that is down to the weather radar), nor does it ask for fewer data from the air data computer, as all the ADC data is still put to use within various onboard systems. Also, a route check before each flight is still essential, to check that the route has been inputted correctly by the pilot. There is no automatic route check, the FMC will happily fly any wrong route just as well as a correct one. ETA is continuously updated using real-time GNSS data, which provides real-time positioning data that includes information about the aircraft's ground speed and track, enabling pilots to have accurate time-of-arrival estimates throughout the flight. Also when integrated with onboard weather systems or data from air traffic control, GNSS enables pilots to continuously monitor and account for actual wind conditions affecting the aircraft's flight path. Note: The feedback on this question is mixed; the question is believed to be almost exactly correct, but the options are not as precise. Any exam feedback on this question would therefore be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. Be sure to remember as much as you can of the above learning objective, so if you do get this question in your exam (it is quite common) and the options are not the same as we have here, you can choose the correct one more easily.",

            "explanation": "When doing an approach in cold conditions, a temperature error correction must be applied since your aircraft will be lower than the indicated altitude. This is very dangerous, as it reduces vertical separation between your aircraft and obstacles. In warm conditions (>ISA), this is not as much of an issue since your aircraft will be at a higher altitude than the one indicated and you will have greater vertical separation from obstacles. A good mnemonic to remember is \"high to low lookout below\". This mnemonic works for both temperature and pressure. If your aircraft is going from a high temperature/pressure area to a low temperature/pressure area, your altimeter will show you an indication that is higher than your true altitude. This means that you will be lower than desired, your vertical separation will be reduced and hence you must \"lookout below\". In cold conditions, you must add a temperature error correction to the DH, MDH or MDA. Temperature error corrections are usually not applied to small deviations from ISA since the difference in altitude would be negligible. The answer \"colder than -10°C\" is the only one that gives a temperature below which you should always apply a temperature correction. For the answers including \"between\", you would not stop applying the temperature correction below -10°C or -15°C. You would keep applying the correction even if it gets colder.",

Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082oT. Variation is 001oW, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082oT+ 1o = 083o M(Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM. Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 12 100 ft (10 600 ft + 1 500 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (12 100/1 000) = -726 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 12 826 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1035 hPa - 1013 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 12 826 ft - 660 ft = 12 166 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 215º (M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL140. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8°C. The airfield elevation must be taken into consideration for the temperature correction: 2600 ft - 600 ft = 2000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (8) × (2000/1000) = 64 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­2664 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 5 885 ft - 875 ft = 5 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (5 010/1 000) = 240 ft.

Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft.

A decision altitude (DA) minimum procedure is used. There are several types of RNP APCH with 3D vertical guidance, and they differ in the way in which they source their vertical guidance information. RNP APCH introduced new types of 3D operations, making use of certified Baro-VNAV systems or the SBAS geometric positioning (RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV and to LPV respectively); GNSS + VNAV is a PBN 3D approach: GNSS nav in the horizontal plane and barometric inputs for the vertical plane; SBAS with vertical guidance (LPV): supported by Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as EGNOS in Europe and WAAS in the US to provide lateral and vertical guidance. Instrument landing systems (ILS), Precision Approach Radar (PAR), and ground-based GNSS augmentation landing systems (GLS) are 3D approaches, which work independently from PBN. RNP1 is a form of RNAV navigation specification (for arrival, initial, intermediate and missed approach segments). Note: This question was recently reported in a Flight Planning in Poland.",

It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a Magnetic bearing of 100o (or Radial 090) emanating from the Aberdeen aerodrome symbol.

            "explanation": "The aircraft must fly at 3 300 ft as this is the MOCA (Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for a given flight level/altitude, in this case we have the temperature at the aerodrome, which is -7ºC at an elevation of 27 ft amsl. As this is so close to sea level, we can say that the ISA temperature is 15ºC, and therefore the ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction for the minimum true altitude (3 300 ft). The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (22) × (3300/1000) = 290.4 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 590.4 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (22 hPa) x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3590.4 ft + (660 ft) = 4250.4 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level suitable for that magnetic track above 4250.4 ft, which is FL60, as per the semicircular rule. The semicircular rule works based on the magnetic track of an aircraft, and for tracks of 000º-179º, IFR aircraft should fly at odd flight levels (FL70, FL90, etc.), and for tracks from 180º-359º, even flight levels (FL60, FL80, etc.) RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The temperature is ISA, therefore temperature correction may be disregarded. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 540 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 800 ft + 540 ft = 8 340 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 235º(M).

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­510 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 25 000 ft + 510 ft = 25 510 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. In this case, the temperature is not provided, therefore we will assume ISA conditions. Thus, the height of the aircraft above airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 25 510 - 3 500 ft = 22 010 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This is the closest available learning objective to this question, and even though none of the given options actually refer directly to the learning objective itself, it does give valuable guidance on which options to reject. All modern transport aircraft will have Flight Management Computers (FMCs) fitted. Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations. The normal calculation method is for the FMC to use actual wind to the next waypoint and pilot-inputted forecast winds beyond that. The actual wind is calculated using FMS position and groundspeed, heading (provided by the IRS or AHRS), and TAS (provided by the Air Data Computer, which is an outside input). The GNSS/FMC combination is not able to detect weather (that is down to the weather radar), nor does it ask for fewer data from the air data computer, as all the ADC data is still put to use within various onboard systems. Also, a route check before each flight is still essential, to check that the route has been inputted correctly by the pilot. There is no automatic route check, the FMC will happily fly any wrong route just as well as a correct one. ETA is continuously updated using real-time GNSS data, which provides real-time positioning data that includes information about the aircraft's ground speed and track, enabling pilots to have accurate time-of-arrival estimates throughout the flight. Also when integrated with onboard weather systems or data from air traffic control, GNSS enables pilots to continuously monitor and account for actual wind conditions affecting the aircraft's flight path. Therefore, the most correct answer would be to provide accurate ETA predictions and calculate the remaining fuel accurately. Note: The feedback on this question is mixed; the question is believed to be almost exactly correct, but the options are not as precise. Any exam feedback on this question would therefore be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. Be sure to remember as much as you can of the above learning objective, so if you do get this question in your exam (it is quite common) and the options are not the same as we have here, you can choose the correct one more easily.",

(The ATC flight plan should have been filled with the letter I (for IFR) in item 8-INCORRECT) After the aircraft's departure from the Lahr aerodrome towards ECHO reporting point, when the aircraft is provided with the IFR clearance being at 1 500 ft AGL, it is within a controlled airspace Class D with an upper vertical limit at 2 500 ft AGL.

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at a minimum true altitude of 9 220 ft (7220 + 2000). This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (10) × (9220/1000) = 369 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules above, to give an indicated altitude of 9 589 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 9589 + 690 = 10 279 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level suitable for that magnetic track above 10 279 ft. Semi-circular cruising level system - Non RVSM flight levels - IFR Magnetic Track 360° - 179° = ODD LEVEL Magnetic Track 180° - 359° = EVEN LEVEL As the Magnetic Track is 175º, an odd level shall be used, so the next usable IFR flight level up from 10 279 ft is FL110",

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of the trip fuel, which requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate aerodrome (ERA). The Minimum Take-Off Fuel is equal to the sum of the following: Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Estimated flight time = 2 856 kg/h x 3.95 hr = 11 281 kg. Contingency fuel: 3% x Trip fuel = 3% x 11 281 kg = 338 kg. Alternate fuel: Average fuel flow x Estimated flight time to the alternate = 2 856 kg/h x 20/60 = 952 kg. Final reserve: 30 min at Holding fuel flow = 2 600 kg/h x 30/60 = 1 300 kg. Thus, totally the Minimum Take-Off Fuel required is: 11 281 kg + 338 kg + 952 kg + 1 300 kg = 13 871 kg.",

The aeroplane flies in still air conditions, thus TAS = GS. So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 164 NM is: Distance / TAS = 164 NM / 422 kt = 0.39 hr.

(3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

The corresponding possible amount of extra fuel is obtained by subtracting the minimum required fuel as described above from the maximum permissible fuel load. MTOM limit: The actual take-off mass (ATOM) for a planned flight can be found by adding the minimum required take-off fuel to the zero fuel mass (ZFM). The amount of extra fuel that can be added is the difference between this ATOM and the maximum take-off mass (MTOM): ATOM = 3825 lb + 705 lb = 4 530 lb MTOM - ATOM = 6 250 lb - 4 530 lb = 1 720 lb The take-off limit would allow us to carry 1 720 lb of extra fuel. MLM limit: The actual landing mass (ALM) is equal to the ATOM minus the planned trip fuel. The amount of extra fuel that can be added is the difference between this ALM and the maximum landing mass (MLM): ALM = 4 530 lb - 375 lb = 4 155 lb MLM - ALM = 4 500 lb - 4 155 lb = 345 lb That means that 345 lb of extra fuel are allowed to remain in the tanks upon arrival. However, this is not the amount of extra fuel that may be loaded due to the fuel penalty. Rule of thumb: to calculate fuel penalty, use the following formula: (MLM extra / 100) x Y - where \"Y\" is the variable given by the question, in this case = 10 ( 345/100) x 10 = 34.5 lb Therefore, the extra fuel that can be loaded is: 345 lb + 34.5 lb = 379.5 lb Fuel tank capacity: Maximum Tank Capacity - (Take off fuel + Taxi fuel) 1 100 lb - (705 lb) = 395 lb",

Please direct your attention to the accompanying note situated in the table: \"Increase/decrease fuel flow by 3% per 10°C above/below standard TAT.\" Based on the given information, the TAT at FL380 is -44°C, which is 12°C lower than the standard TAT of -32°C. Consequently, the final FF/ENG is calculated as follows: Final FF/ENG = 923 kg/h - 3.6% of 923 kg/h = 889.772 kg/h The aircraft has two engines, therefore the total fuel flow is: 2 x 889.772 kg/h = 1779.5 kg/h Once more, we will make use of the attached table to establish the True Airspeed (TAS) at FL380. Kindly consult the relevant section of the attached table: 38 000 ft (-32°C) TAS (kt) 433 This, however, is not the final TAS value for the particular flight. Please refer to the accompanying note positioned above the table: \"Increase/decrease TAS by 1 knot for every 1°C above/below standard TAT.\" According to the information provided, the TAT at FL380 is -44°C, which is 12°C lower than the standard TAT. Consequently, the final TAS is calculated as follows: Final TAS = 433 kt - 12 kt = 421 kt At a speed of 421 kt, the duration needed to cover a distance of 240 NM can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance/Speed = (240 NM)/(421 kt) = 0.57 hours Therefore, with a fuel flow rate of 1779.5 kg/h, we can determine the anticipated fuel consumption for the flight at FL380: Fuel consumption = (0.57h) x (1779.5 kg/h) = 1014 kg",

For instance, this is often the case with certain Mediterranean islands. It can be cheaper to carry (tanker) as much fuel as possible from the departure airport rather than refuel at the destination. You may also need to tanker fuel if the destination airport is short on fuel or unable to provide it, due to reasons such as a workers' strike or a broken fuel pipeline. However, carrying more fuel than legally required incurs a commercial penalty because more fuel is burned carrying the additional mass. Therefore, you need to calculate whether it is worth doing. In an airline operation, this decision is usually made by the operations department, and you would notice from the operational flight plan that you are tankering fuel.",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

OP. MPA.181 Fuel/energy scheme - fuel/energy planning and in-flight re-planning policy — aeroplane BASIC FUEL SCHEME — PRE-FLIGHT CALCULATION OF USABLE FUEL FOR PERFORMANCE CLASS A AEROPLANES For the pre-flight calculation of the usable fuel in accordance with point CAT. OP. MPA.181, the operator should: (a) for taxi fuel, take into account the local conditions at the departure aerodrome and the APU consumption; (b) for trip fuel, include: (1) fuel for take-off and climb from the aerodrome elevation to the initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (2) fuel from the top of climb to the top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (3) fuel from the top of descent to the point where the approach procedure is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival routing; and (4) fuel for making an approach and landing at the destination aerodrome; (c) for contingency fuel, calculate for unforeseen factors either: (1) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight re-planning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; or (2) an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions, whichever is the higher; (d) for destination alternate fuel, include: (1) when the aircraft is operated with one destination alternate aerodrome: (i) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to the missed-approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed-approach procedure; (ii) fuel for climb from the missed-approach altitude to the cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (iii) fuel for cruising from the top of climb to the top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (iv) fuel for descent from the top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival routing; and (v) fuel for making an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; and (2) when the aircraft is operated with two destination alternate aerodromes, the amount of fuel that is calculated in accordance with point (d)(1), based on the destination alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of fuel; (e) for FRF, comply with point CAT. OP. MPA.181(c);.(c) final reserve fuel/energy that shall be the amount of fuel/energy that is calculated at holding speed at 1 500ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions according to the aeroplane estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome, or destination aerodrome when no destination alternate aerodrome is required, and shall not be less than: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the fuel/energy to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for turbine-engined aeroplanes, the fuel/energy to fly for 30 minutes;. (f) for additional fuel, include an amount of fuel that allows the aeroplane to proceed, in the event of an engine failure or loss of pressurisation, from the most critical point along the route to a fuel en route alternate (fuel ERA) aerodrome in the relevant aircraft configuration, hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, make an approach, and land; (g) for extra fuel, include anticipated delays or specific operational constraints that can be predicted; and (h) for discretionary fuel, include a quantity at the sole discretion of the commander. BASIC FUEL SCHEME WITH VARIATIONS — CONTINGENCY FUEL (a) Contingency fuel variations are methods of reducing the basic amount of contingency fuel based on established mitigating measures. (b) If the operator establishes and maintains a fuel consumption monitoring system for individual aeroplanes, and uses valid data for fuel calculation based on such a system, the operator may use any of the requirements in point (c) or (d) of this AMC to calculate the contingency fuel. (c) The contingency fuel should be the fuel described in points (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AMC, whichever is higher: (1) an amount of fuel that should be either: (i) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel, or in the event of in-flight re-planning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight provided that a fuel en route alternate (fuel ERA) aerodrome is available; or (ii) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20-minute flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption; or (iii) an amount of fuel based on a statistical fuel method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel; prior to implementing a statistical fuel method, a continuous 2-year operation is required during which statistical contingency fuel (SCF) data is recorded — note: to use SCF on a particular city pair/aeroplane combination, sufficient data is required to be statistically significant; the operator should use this method to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination, and to carry out a statistical analysis to calculate the required contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; or (2) an amount of fuel to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions.",

Interpolation is required between 777 NAM and 798 NAM. 781 is within 777 (38 500 kg) and 798 (38 600 kg). First find the difference between NAM at 38 500 kg (777) NAM at 38 600 kg (798) = 21NM => for an \"interval\" of 100 kg If you divide 100 by 21 you will get the corresponding mass for each 1 NM. 100 / 21 = 4.8 kg Which means that each NM corresponds to 4.8 kg. Now we need to find the corresponding mass to 781: 781 - 777 = 4 NM 4 (NM) x 4.8 kg = 19.2 kg 38 500 kg + 19.2 kg = 38 519 kg Start mass - new mass = fuel burn 40 000 kg - 38 519 kg = 1481 kg.",

The standard way of calculating contingency fuel was, historically, to calculate the highest of 5% of trip fuel or 5 min of holding fuel. Nowadays, with long haul flights (sometimes as long as 16h), 5% of trip fuel would be quite a lot. Using the RCF Procedure, allows this contingency fuel to be significantly reduced.

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price. You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass",

EASA AIR OPS AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel which should include: (i)fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander. In this case: TAXI Taxi fuel is 10L. 10 L TRIP Departure + Cruise + Approach + Landing 40 L + (2 h 24 min x 95) + 20 L = 288 L CONTINGENCY The greater of: 5% of trip fuel or 5 min holding 288 x 5% = 14.4 L Or 5 min x 76 L/h = 6.3 L ALTERNATE Departure aerodrome will be used as an alternate 40 L + (2 h 24 min x 95) + 20 L = 288 L FINAL RESERVE For aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes 45 min x 76 L/h = 57 L ADDITIONAL Not required 0 L TOTAL (BLOCK FUEL) 10 L + 288 L + 14.4 L + 288 L + 57 L = 657.4 L",

(2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency fuel can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of trip fuel. Use of this option requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate (ERA) aerodrome, which must cover some prerequisites: Shall be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance, the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight plan distance, or at least 20% of the total flight plan distance plus 50 NM, whichever is greater. For this question, the Minimum Block fuel required is equal to: Taxi fuel + Trip fuel + Contingency fuel + Alternate fuel + Final Reserve fuel + Additional fuel(if required) + Extra fuel(if required) Taxi fuel = 150 kg Trip fuel = 2101 kg Contingency fuel (if an enroute alternate is available)= 3% x planned trip fuel or 5 min holding at 1500 ft above the destination aerodrome (whichever is greater) = 3% x 2101=63 kg or 5/60 x 2735 kg/hr = 228 kg. Thus, contingency fuel is 228 kg. Alternate fuel = 2046 kg Final Reserve fuel (for turbine engines) = fuel for 30 min holding at 1500 ft = 30/60 x 2735 kg/hr = 1367.5 kg. Therefore, the minimum block fuel required is: 150 kg + 2101 kg + 228 kg + 2046 kg + 1367.5 kg = 5892.5 kg, which is very close to 5893 kg.",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Under normal fuel planning rules, contingency can be calculated in a number of different ways. So far, the standard option has been to use 5% of the trip fuel. However, there is an option to use 3% of the trip fuel, which requires the selection of an En-Route Alternate aerodrome (ERA). The Minimum Take-Off Fuel is equal to the sum of the following: Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Trip time = Average fuel flow x (Air distance / Estimated TAS) = 3048 kg/h x (2725 NAM / 431 kt) = 19 271 kg. OR Trip fuel: Average fuel flow x Trip time = Average fuel flow x (Route distance / Estimated GS) = 3048 kg/h x [2548 NM / (431 - 28) kt] = 19 271 kg Contingency fuel: 3% x Trip fuel = 3% x 19 271 kg = 578 kg.

            "explanation": "Actual TAT at FL380 is -22o C, so it is above the standard TAT -32o C, given in the table, by 10o C. According to the table given, at FL380 with.786 Mach speed, 60 000 kg mass and TAT -32o C, the TAS is 451 kt and the Fuel Flow per engine is 1 087 kg/hr. To calculate the fuel flow required for the ground distance 310 NM, the actual time flown is required: Actual time= Ground distance / Ground speed. With a 25 kt headwind, the groundspeed will be 451 - 25 = 426 kt. Applying the note, the TAS must be increased by 1 kts for each degree above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 426 + 10 = 436 kt The a/c will cover the ground distance 310 NM with 436 kt groundspeed in: 310/436 = 0.71 hour. For 0.71 hr flight time, the a/c will burn: 1 087 x 0.71 = 772 kg per engine, so both engines will burn: 772 x 2 = 1 544 kg. Applying the note, the fuel flow must be increased by 3% per 10o C above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 1 544 + (3% x 1 544) = 1 590 kg.",

If an operator's fuel policy includes planning to an isolated aerodrome, the last possible point of diversion to any available en-route alternate aerodrome shall be used as the pre-determined point. According to EASA Annex IV (Part-CAT): If the operator’s fuel planning policy includes an isolated aerodrome, the additional fuel, if required, must be not less than, the fuel to fly for 2 hours with normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome, including the Final Reserve Fuel, for turbine-engined aeroplanes. Therefore, for this question, the additional fuel that must be carried for an isolated aerodrome is: Cruise fuel consumption x 2 hours = 4 060 kg/hr x 2 hr = 8 120 kg.",

From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 210 000 kg. If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering. With regards to this question, Planned take-off mass: 190 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial. HOWEVER, first we must check if we are limited by the Maximum Take Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass or Maximum tank capacity. Our Maximum Take-Off Mass will be the lowest of Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) and Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel: MTOM = 205 000 kg Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel = 180 000 kg + 22 000 kg = 202 000 kg (lowest) => Meaning that we could carry an extra amount of fuel equal to 202 000 kg - 190 000 kg = 12 000 kg => However, our Maximum Fuel tank capacity = 40 000 kg and we already have 30 000 kg onboard => which means that we can only carry 10 000 kg of fuel extra.",

For the flight LFPG-EIDW, the crew have loaded a total of 5 226 kg. This means they will land at EIDW with 1 906 kg onboard (after burning taxi, contingency and trip fuel). For the flight back (EIDW - LFPG), the crew needs a minimum block fuel of 7 100 kg. Therefore, at LFPG, they should load 7 100 kg - 1 906 kg = 5 194 kg extra. However, carrying more fuel, adds weight to the aircraft and increases the fuel consumption. So, the fuel penalty from LFPG to EIDW must be applied. For every weight change per 1 000 kg, add 60 Kg to the Total fuel: 5 194 kg / 1 000 x 60 kg = 312 kg.

Our new TAS will 429 and GS will be 399. Therefore trip time will increase about 429 / 399 = 1.07 times. Which will be proportional to fuel consumption. Option with the same 30 kt headwind and lower than ISA temp. is definitely consume less fuel than the previous one as at lower than ISA temperatures less fuel consumed. Finally about 50 kt headwind option our TAS will be 424 and GS will be 374. Trip time increase is 424 / 374 = 1.13 Therefore assuming the same fuel flow clearly this one will cause greatest increase in trip fuel required.",

(2) The sum of: (i) taxi fuel; (ii) trip fuel from the departure aerodrome to the destination alternate aerodrome, via the predetermined point; (iii) contingency fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(3); (iv) additional fuel if required, but not less than: (A) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines: fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (B) for aeroplanes with turbine engines: fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination alternate aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, this should not be less than final reserve fuel; and (v) extra fuel if required by the commander. (d) Isolated aerodrome procedure: If the operator’s fuel policy includes planning to an isolated aerodrome, the last possible point of diversion to any available en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome should be used as the Pre-Determined Point. Thus, applying the above rule and using the data given by the annex, we get: PDP-1 (Dep - PDP - GVAC): Taxi 200 kg + Trip fuel 16 239 kg + Contingency fuel 487 kg + Additional fuel 5 698 kg (2 hours at cruise fuel flow 2849 Kg/h) = 22 624 kg PDP-2 (Dep - PDP - GCTS): Taxi 200 kg + Trip fuel 20 825 kg + Contingency fuel 625 kg + Additional fuel 1 200 kg (same as final reserve 30 min with holding fuel flow 2400 Kg/h) = 22 850 kg.

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Enter the table at 49 000 kg and read the corresponding distance: 3063 NM Which gives us a range of 3261 NM - 3063 NM = 198 NM for 1000 kg 2. Since the temperature changed from ISA conditions to ISA +10ºC (-45ºC) => we must perform the fuel adjustment: Read Note 2 at the bottom of the table: \"A) Increase fuel required by 0.6 percent per 10 degrees C above ISA\" 1000 kg x 0.6% = 6 1000 kg + 6 kg = 1006 kg (meaning that at ISA +10ºC, the aircraft will consume 1006 kg to cover 198 NAM. Therefore, the distance we can travel on 1000 kg = 198 x (1000/1006) = 196.8 NAM, a reduction of 198 - 196.8 = 1.2 NAM ATPLQ Note: We would kindly ask anyone who has further information on this question to contact us.

With a 45 kt tailwind, the groundspeed will be 433 + 45 = 478 kts. Applying the note, the TAS must be reduced by 1 kts for each degree below standard TAT.

So, it becomes: 923 - (3% x 923) = 895 kg/hr. For 0.47 hour flight time, the a/c will burn: 895 x 0.47 = 420 kgs per engine, so both engines will burn: 420 x 2 = 840 kgs.

The question intentionally asks from the students to fill in the table, because the answer comes from the sum of the flight times which correspond to each fuel amount related with the airborne time (excluding taxi fuel). The Contingency fuel is: 5% x Trip fuel = 5% x 5 800 kg = 290 kg, which corresponds to a flight time of: 5% x 02:32 = 7.6 min. The Final Reserve fuel for a twin jet aeroplane is always fuel to fly for 00:30. The Extra fuel is: Ramp fuel - Taxi fuel - Trip fuel - Contingency fuel - Final Reserve fuel - Alternate fuel = 585 kg. The fuel flow for the Extra fuel is given as 2 400 kg/hr. So, the Extra fuel of 585 kg will permit to fly for: 585 kg / 2 400 kg/hr = 14.6 min. Thus, the ATC endurance is the sum of the following flight times: 02:32 + 00:07.6 + 00:42 + 00:30 + 00:14.6 = 04:06.2, which is very close to 04:07.",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

To calculate the fuel, time and distance from take-off to Top of Climb, follow the procedure below: Enter the graph on the left side base scale at the aerodrome OAT +8°C and travel vertically up to intersect the aerodrome Pressure Altitude 4000 ft grid-line. From this grid-line move horizontally right to intersect the fuel, time and distance grid-lines in turn.

From each intersection drop vertically to read the appropriate value from the graph: FUEL = 8.5 USG TIME = 16 min AIR DISTANCE = 28 NAM Finally, subtract the values determined at aerodrome pressure altitude from those determined at TOC, to obtain the values of the fuel used to climb, the time taken to climb, and the air distance travelled in the climb: FUEL from T/O to ToC = 8.5 - 3.8 = 4.7 USG TIME from T/O to ToC = 16 - 7 = 9 min AIR DISTANCE from T/O to ToC = 28 - 11 = 17 NAM",

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required.

(7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander SUMMARY: Trip fuel is the amount of fuel required for everything from the takeoff roll at the departure aerodrome UNTIL end of the landing roll on touchdown at the destination aerodrome. This includes all climbs and descents, and a single approach and landing at the destination. This does not include Contingency fuel, Final Reserve, Additional fuel etc.",

Consequently, the final FF/ENG is calculated as follows: Final FF/ENG = 1 163 kg/h + 4.5% of 1 163 kg/h = 1 215.335 kg/h The aircraft has two engines, therefore the total fuel flow is: 2 x 1 215.335 kg/h = 2 430.67 kg/h Once more, we will make use of the attached table to establish the True Airspeed (TAS) at FL360. Kindly consult the relevant section of the attached table: 36 000 ft (-32ºC) TAS (kt) 450 This, however, is not the final TAS value for the particular flight. Please refer to the accompanying note positioned above the table: \"Increase/decrease TAS by 1 knot for every 1°C above/below standard TAT.\" According to the information provided, the TAT at FL360 is -17°C, which is 15°C higher than the standard TAT. Consequently, the final TAS is calculated as follows: Final TAS = 450 kt + 15 kt = 465 kt At a speed of 465 kt, the duration needed to cover a distance of 295 NM can be calculated as follows: Time = Distance/Speed = (295 NM)/(465 kt) = 0.6344 hours Therefore, with a fuel flow rate of 2 430.67 kg/h, we can determine the anticipated fuel consumption for the flight at FL360: Fuel consumption = (0.6344) x (2 430.67 kg/h) = 1 542 kg",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

It is calculated by the formula; NAM/TAS = NGM/GS where NAM is Nautical Air Miles and NGM is Nautical Ground Miles. The Great Circle Distance (G/C DIST) is the direct distance from departure to destination aerodrome, following the great circle (shortest) track around the Earth. In this question, the GND DIST is shorter than the AIR DIST, due to an average headwind of 30 kts.

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the \"break even fuel price\". You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop. Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass You would not tanker fuel BECAUSE the destination airport is below minima, but it is suitable to tanker if that is the case, as the extra weight does not affect us in that capability, and in fact, having the extra fuel is nice for potential diversions. However, tankering is a commercial procedure, and if the Commander wishes to take more fuel for weather diversion or holding, they should use \"extra fuel\" for that purpose.",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Thus, an alternate aerodrome with a CAT II approach allowing an RVR of 300 m would not be suitable for use as an alternate, unless the weather conditions were CAT I, 550 m RVR or better (allowing a safety margin). During the pre-flight planning procedure, the pilot must consider: Weather at Destination above Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Destination Alternate above Planning minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Take-off Alternate Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. And after Take-off: Weather at Destination must be above Operating minima at ETA. Weather at Destination Alternate must be above Planning minima at ETA. Also, for a twin-engine aircraft, a Take-off alternate within 60 minutes flying time of the Deparure aerodrome with One-Engine-Inoperative must be considered. Therefore, the destination aerodrome can be considered as the Take-off alternate, thus no Additional fuel is required.",

Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 2650 NM by interpolating between 2500 NM and 3000 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 214 000 kg. If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering. Because the savings would be lost due to the excess fuel burn (higher fuel consumption based on the extra fuel mass). With regards to this question, Planned take-off mass: 190 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial. HOWEVER, first we must check if we are limited by the Maximum Take Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass or Maximum tank capacity. Maximum tank capacity is 55 000 kg and we already have 30 000 kg loaded in the tanks - therefore, we can fit in additional 25 000 kg. Our Maximum Take-Off Mass will be the lowest of Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) and Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel: MTOM = 205 000 kg Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel = 180 000 kg + 22 000 kg = 202 000 kg (lowest) => This means that we could carry an amount of fuel equal to 202 000 kg - 190 000 kg = 12 000 kg additional fuel which is the correct answer to this question.",

Carrying an extra fuel, incurs a fuel penalty, because the increased mass means that the aircraft cruising level and/or performance are reduced. Thus, since the fuel consumption increases, due to the increased aircraft's mass, some of the extra fuel is consumed in carrying the extra mass.

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price. You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy LOCATION OF THE FUEL EN-ROUTE ALTERNATE (FUEL ERA) AERODROME The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance, the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight plan distance, or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM, whichever is greater. All distances should be calculated in still air conditions. Considering the above we have: “The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance” RADIUS: 1200 NM x 20% = 240 NM “the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight”: 1200 NM x 25% = 300 NM “or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM”: 1200 NM x 20% + 50 = 290 NM, whichever is greater. DISTANCE FROM DESTINATION: 300 NM => REFER TO FIGURE We take 300 NM from the destination aerodrome – that will be the centre of our circle of 240 NM radius => we can conclude that the centre of the circle will be located 900 NM (1200 – 300) from the departure aerodrome. We get ERA “X” located at 660 NM (900 – 240) from Departure aerodrome. Actual “X” is situated at only 600 NM. Therefore, we can conclude that “X” can not be considered an ERA - which means we can’t reduce contingency to 3% and instead we must take 5% contingency. CONTINGENCY: 5% x 7200 kg = 360 kg.

Please let us know if you see this question and remember anything about it from the real exam, thank you! The trip fuel is calculated for a flight based on its expected routing, winds, cruise altitude, and aircraft weight. These can change, and therefore there are procedures in place to account for these changes. The addition of contingency fuel covers some of these changes, but a flight's OFP (operation flight plan) will often include a section detailing the change to fuel burn that comes from a weight change (1000 kg increase, for example) or a change in cruise altitude (for instance 2000 ft above or 2000 ft below the planned cruising level). In particular for this question, the weight change could occur from last minute changes to the passenger load, or some extra fuel that the commander decides to take. Any increase in aircraft weight increases the induced drag of the aircraft, thereby increasing the fuel burn. Any decrease in weight will therefore decrease the fuel burn. Applying the reduction in the question, 1500 kg weight reduction is 1.5 x the 1000 kg reduction, so you can just multiply the 205 kg fuel reduction by 1.5 to get a total trip fuel that is 307.5 kg less than the original trip fuel requirement (closest answer 308 kg)",

Because of TAT (-42°C) below the Standard TAT (-32°C) by 10°C, decrease the fuel flow by 3%: 1 927 kg/hr - 58 kg/hr = 1 869 kg/hr. Also, the TAS at FL370 for a mass of 52 500 kg is: 432 kt, but because of TAT below the Standard TAT by 10°C, it decreases to: 432 kt - 10 kt = 422 kt. The aeroplane experiences a 25 kt headwind, thus GS = TAS - 25 kt = 422 kt - 25 kt = 397 kt. So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 150 NM is: Distance / TAS = 150 NM / 397 kt = 0.38 hr.

Now, the dashed lines represent FL370 and the solid lines represent FL100. You should interpolate between those 2 lines: Continue diagonally to the right following the reference line (a rough interpolation between the 2 reference lines) until you intersect the landing mass = 55 000 kg. Now, continue horizontally to the right and read the result of approx 17 000 kg.

Taxi fuel: As the question is asking for the block fuel, you need to consider the taxi fuel: 150 kg Trip fuel: The trip fuel consists of the fuel required for: Take Off and climb until the TOC Cruise (from TOC to TOD) Descent (from TOD) Approach The take off and climb fuel is 1 600 kg. Then we need to find the fuel the airplane will burn during the cruise. Cruise distance: 570 NAM Cruise fuel consumption: 6 kg/NAM 6 kg.1 NAM ? kg. 570 NAM ⇒ 570 × 6 = 3 420 kg The last fuel we need to find to get the trip fuel is the descent/approach fuel. Fuel for descent: 270 kg Fuel for approach and landing: 450 kg => 450 + 270 = 720 kg Trip fuel = 1 600 + 3 420 + 720 = 5 740 kg Contingency fuel: For this question the contingency fuel is 5% of the trip fuel. 5 % of 5 740= 287 kg Alternate fuel: Takes into account the fuel required for a missed approach from the destination aerodrome, climb to the cruising level towards the destination alternate, cruising towards the TOD, descending and executing an approach at the destination alternate airfield. Alternate fuel is given in the question: 2 150 kg. Additional fuel: No additional fuel is required since we have a destination alternate aerodrome. Final Reserve: Since the holding fuel consumption is 2 200 kg/h, the final reserve is (30 Minutes) 1 100 kg. Block fuel = 150 + 5 740 + 287 +2 150 + 1 100 = 9 427 kg",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

(2) If an in-flight fuel check shows that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is less than: (ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required, the commander shall take appropriate action and proceed to an adequate aerodrome so as to perform a safe landing with not less than final reserve fuel. 2.

A similar relationship exists between pounds or libres and imperial gallons: one IG of water weighs ten pounds or libres. Specific Gravity (SG) is a measurement of the relative density: Mass of a given volume of fluid / Mass of an equal volume of water. To convert fuel volumes we need to know that fuel is lighter than water. A volume of fuel in this question weighs 78% of the equivalent volume of water. That means that one IG of fuel weighs: 10 x 0.78 = 7.8 lbs. Therefore, 670 IG weigh: 670 IG x 7.8 lbs = 5226 lb.",

ISA temperature at FL330 = 15 - 2 x 33 = -51ºC; OAT = -30ºC => Therefore, ISA +21ºC 2. Enter the graph. Draw a vertical line from the bottom of the chart from a value of 720 NM until the Wind Reference Line. 3. From this point, apply the headwind correction equivalent to 20 kts headwind by drawing a slightly curved line upwards until you intersect the 20 kts headwind line. 4. Continue vertically upwards to intersect the FL330 line. From this point, we will have 2 different lines: Find out the fuel required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue horizontally to the right until the \"Landing Weight\" Reference Line. Now, the dashed lines represent FL370 and the solid lines represent FL100. You should usually choose to interpolate between those 2 lines, but here you can just try to parallel the dashed lines for FL370 as a reference since our cruising level of FL330 is much closer to FL370 than FL100. We have interpolated in the annex above for best accuracy, but when drawing these by hand, that kind of accuracy is very difficult to acheive. Continue diagonally to the right following the reference line (FL370) until you intersect the landing mass = 50000 kg (ZFM) + 2000 kg (Final Reserve) + 1000 kg (Alternate Fuel) = 53 000 kg. Now, continue horizontally to the right and read the result of approx 4800 kg. Find out the time required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue vertically up until you intersect the \"29 & ABOVE\" reference line. From this point, continue horizontally to the left until the ISA deviation reference line. Now, apply the ISA deviation correction for ISA +21ºC (slightly off the scale but just use +20) - continue diagonally downwards to the left and read a result of 1.9 hours or 1 h 54 m. At this section on the vertical scale, every small box is worth 3 minutes Closest option: 4800 kg, 01 h 54 min",

The minimum ramp fuel load is the sum of the following fuel amounts: Taxy fuel: 600 kg Trip fuel: Average cruise consumption x Flight time from departure to destination = 10 000 kg/h x 6 hours = 60 000 kg Contingency fuel: 5% of the Trip fuel = 5% x 60 000 kg = 3 000 kg Alternate fuel: 10 200 kg Additional fuel: N/A Final Reserve fuel (for a jet aeroplane fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft above alternate airfield elevation): 8 000 kg/hr / 2 = 4 000 kg Extra fuel: N/A Thus, the minimum ramp fuel load is 77 800 kg.

            "explanation": "Refer of figure. If the cost of fuel at destination is higher than the cost at departure, then it is better to tanker cheaper fuel at the departure. But, when tankering additional fuel, the aircraft's mass increases, thus, the fuel consumption inceases too, incurring extra cost. The decision to tanker fuel is then based on a comparison of the two costs and the sector distance. The figure involves a comparison of cost (by calculation of the fuel price ratio: departure fuel price divided by destination fuel price) and then for a given sector distance, we get the \"OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS\", which is the MTOM that permits fuel tanking. So: If the OPTIMUM TOM < Planned TOM, then do not fuel tank. If the OPTIMUM TOM > Planned TOM, then tanker an extra fuel amount equal to the difference: Planned TOM - OPTIMUM TOM. To get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS, apply the following steps: Enter with the fuel price ratio of 0.915. Move horizontally to the right until cossing the air distance line 2 000 NM. Continue vertically down to get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS 208 000 kg. Also, check if any limit is exceeded: The OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS (208 000 kg) is more than the MTOM (205 000 kg). Thus, the aircraft can not carry more than: MTOM - Planned TOM = 205 000 kg - 185 000 kg = 20 000 kg of extra fuel for tankering purposes. Planned T/O fuel + Extra fuel = 30 000 kg + 20 000 kg = 50 000 kg, which is greater than the Tank capacity (40 000 kg) by 10 000 kg. So, the Extra fuel must be reduced by 10 000 kg to able to be loaded. So, the Revised Extra fuel because of being Tank capacity-limited is: 20 000 kg - 10 000 kg = 10 000 kg. Actual Landing Mass after tankering Extra fuel = Planned TOM - Trip fuel + Extra fuel = 185 000 kg - 18 000 kg + 10 000 kg = 177 000 kg, which is greater than the MLM (175 000 kg) by 2 000 kg. So, the previously Revised Extra fuel (10 000 kg) must be further reduced by 2 000 kg, so as not to exceed the MLM structural limit. So, the Final Revised Extra fuel, because of MLM-limited, is: 10 000 kg - 2 000 kg = 8 000 kg.",

Read corresponding value of 174 200 kg. Third Step: Correct 174 200 kg for climbing. Aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. Intersect cruising speed of 0.82 with our mass at brake release 210 000 kg (\"210\") - find a value of 2.9 (2900 kg) - Note that fuel consumption is higher in climb (resulting in a lighter aircraft) => subtract 2900 kg from 174 200 kg = 171 300 kg Fourth Step: Correct 171 300 kg for descent. Again, aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. For a mass of 170 000 kg (\"170\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg) and for a mass of 180 000 kg (\"180\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg).

Calculate the range when 10 kt tailwind: NGM = 185 x (416 + 10) / 416 = 189 NGM => As you can see from the above, when we experience a reduction of tailwind from 25 kt to 10 kt, the range decreases 196 NGM - 189 NGM = 7 NGM.",

OP. MPA.180(b)(2), are fulfilled; N/A (v) final reserve fuel; N/A (vi) additional fuel; and N/A (vii) extra fuel if required by the commander. N/A FOR (b)(1) – we have a value of 10 000 kg + 275 kg = 10 275 kg (2) The sum of: (i) taxi fuel; N/A (ii) trip fuel to the destination 2 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance A-C-ALT: 900 NM + 200 NM = 1100 NM Flight time: 1100 NM / 400 kt = 2.75 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 2.75 h x 2000 kg/h = 5500 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount calculated in accordance with (a)(3)(*) above from departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome; 5500 kg x 5% = 275 kg (iv) alternate fuel, if a destination 2 alternate aerodrome is required; N/A (v) final reserve fuel; N/A (vi) additional fuel; and N/A (vii) extra fuel if required by the commander. N/A FOR (b)(2) – we have a value of 5500 kg + 275 kg = 5775 kg => We will, therefore, choose the highest value which corresponds to (b)(1) => 10 275 kg. SECOND SCENARIO (DECISION POINT OVER D): (1) The sum of: (ii) trip fuel to the destination 1 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance ADB: 2000 NM Flight Time = 2 000 NM / 400 kt = 5 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 5 h x 2000 kg/h = 10 000 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than 5 % of the estimated fuel consumption from the decision point to the destination 1 aerodrome; Distance DB: 900 NM Flight time: 900 NM / 400 kt = 2.25 h 2.25 h x 2000 kg/h = 4500 kg Contingency = 5% x 4500 kg = 225 kg (.) FOR (b)(1) – we have a value of 10 000 kg + 225 kg = 10 225 kg (2) The sum of: (i) taxi fuel; N/A (ii) trip fuel to the destination 2 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance A-D-ERA: 900 NM + 200NM + 200 NM = 1300 NM Flight time: 1300 NM / 400 kt = 3.25 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 3.25 h x 2000 kg/h = 6500 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount calculated in accordance with (a)(3)(*) above from departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome; 6500 kg x 5% = 325 kg (.) FOR (b)(2) – we have a value of 6 500 kg + 325 kg = 6 825 kg => We will, therefore, choose the highest value which corresponds to (b)(1) => 10 225 kg. We must compare both greatest values obtained (10 275 kg and 10 225 kg). We can conclude that, when moving DP from C to D, the Fuel required will decrease by 10 275 kg – 10 225 kg = 50 kg. NOTE: An exhaustive explanation has been created so you can understand where the value comes from but no calculation is needed: it needs understanding that when you move the DP closer to destination the amount of fuel needed decrease as in Decision Point procedure the contingency fuel for destination is only from DP to destination. As DP move closer to destination, the contingency fuel decrease.",

Referring to the table which allows us to find the cruise consumption, find the effective range for a weight of 48 000 kg => Enter the first column under “GROSS WT. kg”, track downwards until you find “48 000”, read the value under the second column “0” which corresponds to 48 000 kg. According to the table, the range equals 2862 NAM. TAS can be read off the table. TAS = 426 kt. As OAT = ISA, no temperature correction is applied to TAS. In 2 hours cruise (minimum additional fuel), the distance covered = 2 h x 426 kt = 852 NAM. Since we do not have to travel a distance on the ground, we do not need to compensate for the wind. To determine the aircraft’s weight at the end of the 2 hours, we must subtract the required distance in air miles for 2 h (852 NM) from the effective range (2862 NM) which corresponds to 48 000 kg: 2862 – 852 = 2010 NM Now we must find out to which weight 2010 NM corresponds to: In the table, we can find 2009 NM (which is close enough), corresponding mass = 43900 kg (aircraft mass after 2 hrs flight) Fuel consumption in 2 hrs = 48 000 kg - 43 900 kg = 4100 kg Closest Answer = 4095 kg",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The modifications resulting from the updated fuel policy regulations, which came into effect on October 30, 2022, are only changes in wording but nothing really new. The terminology \"extra fuel\" has been replaced with \"discretionary fuel.\" EASA has clarified that the calculations and procedures pertaining to fuel calculations will remain unchanged, and there will be no new questions regarding the new \"extra fuel\" concept. extra fuel, include anticipated delays or specific operational constraints that can be predicted discretionary fuel, include a quantity at the sole discretion of the commander For reference, additional information can be found in EASA's AIR OPS documentation. The total amount of fuel required for this commetcial flight should include the following fuel quantities: Taxi fuel + Trip fuel + Contingency fuel + Alternate Fuel + Final reserve fuel. Therefore, we have: Taxi Fuel: The Taxi fuel includes the fuel expected to be used prior to take-off and the fuel consumed by the use of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). In this question, the APU usage at the parking position is 0 minutes. For the calculation of the taxi fuel, we take into consideration the fuel consumption only at the departure aerodrome. Fuel flow during taxi: 11 kg per minute Planned taxi time: 10 minutes Taxi fuel = 11 kg/min x 10 min = 110 kg Trip Fuel: Average fuel flow is 2618 kg/h. We must calculate the flight time. We have TAS = 421 kt and average wind component = - 24 kt (headwind) ⇒ Ground Speed = TAS - Headwind component = 421 kt - 24 kt = 397 kt. With a Ground Speed of 397 kt (397 kt = 397 NM/h), the time required to cover the distance of 748 NM is: Time = Distance/Ground Speed = 748/397 Given that the flight time is 748/397 h and the average fuel flow is 2638 kg/h, the Trip fuel is: Trip fuel = (748/397) h x 2618 kg/h = 4 932.65 kg (approx. 4 933 kg) Contingency fuel: Question states that Contingency fuel is 5% of the Trip fuel. Since the Trip fuel is 4 933 kg, the Contingency fuel is: Contingency fuel = 0.05 x 4 933 kg = 246.65 kg (approx. 247 kg) Alternate fuel: Question states that Alternate fuel equals 550 kg. Final Reserve fuel: According to EASA Air Ops (AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel Policy), the Final reserve fuel for an aeroplane with turbine engines, is the fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1500 ft above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions. From the question, the holding fuel flow is 2 250 kg/h. As a result, the Final reserve fuel is: Final reserve fuel = (30 x 2 250)/60 kg = 1 125 kg The total amount of fuel required for this commercial flight is: Total fuel = 110 kg + 4 933 kg + 247 kg + 550 kg + 1 125 kg = 6 965 kg.",

The wind correction angle is the angle by which the pilot adjusts the heading to compensate for the crosswind component of the wind. Under the forecasted wind, the wind is causing the aircraft to drift to the right, necessitating a wind correction angle to the left.

Set wind direction to 080º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 155 kt. Mark the wind velocity 35 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 113º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 122º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 113º. This occurs at a heading of 104º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 124 kt.

ISA Dev. +20ºC 6 000 ft 172 kt 7 000 ft (172 kt + 169 kt) / 2 = 170.5 kt 8 000 ft 169 kt ISA Dev. 0ºC 6 000 ft 171 kt 7 000 ft (171 kt + 169 kt) / 2 = 170 kt 8 000 ft 169 kt FL70, ISA Dev. +10ºC = (170 kt + 170.5) / 2 = 170.25 kt Now, using the flight computer to determine drift, remember that we are using a track, not a heading. Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (170 knots). Position the wind direction (110º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (142º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (170 knots). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 9º left correction (-9º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 9ºL corresponds to a drift of 9ºR.",

It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated. The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river.

Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (179 knots). Position the wind direction (330º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (190º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (179 kt). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 10º right correction (+10º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 10ºR corresponds to a drift of 10ºL.",

Knowing our True Altitude, let's find Indicated Altitude: Indicated Altitude = True Altitude + Temperature Correction + Pressure correction Temperature Correction Rule of thumb: correction of 4% for each 10ºC deviation from ISA ISA deviation = -10ºC. Therefore we will apply a correction of 4%. 15 421 ft x 4% = 617 ft As ISA deviation is negative (-10ºC), Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude. Indicated Altitude = 15 421 ft + 617 ft = 16 038 ft Pressure correction If the current QNH is 989 hPa, the difference to standard pressure will be: 1013 hPa – 989 hPa = 24 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30ft/hPa: 24 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 720 ft Since our current QNH is lower than standard, Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude: 16 038 ft + 720 ft = 16 758 ft. This altitude is also called Pressure altitude (PA).

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and flight level Upon inspection of LOGI, we can see that it is situated between 4 different areas with different Grid MORAs (Minimum Off-Route Altitude). We must take the highest Grid MORA, in order to ensure that we have a safe vertical separation. The aircraft must fly at 10 800 ft. This must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 800/1000) = -648 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 11 448 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1018 hPa - 1013 hPa = 5 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (5) x 30 ft/hPa = 150 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 448 - 150 = 11 298 ft Since we are a VFR flight, we are required to fly at altitudes that are whole thousands plus 500 feet. The only altitude above 11 298 ft which also obeys this rule is FL115. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Set wind direction to 300º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 110 kt. Mark the wind velocity 16 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 7ºL drift and a track of 263º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 277º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 96 kt.

The appropriate altitude or flight level must be determined using the magnetic track (not heading).

Near coordinates N49°00, E012°30, the navigational aid depicted according to the chart’s legend is the VOR/DME RDG (Roding) with frequency 114.70 MHz. Near coordinates N48°30ı, E12°30' there are two navigational aids depicted: TACAN/DME END with frequency 115.40 MHz. NDB EGG with frequency 393 kHz. Near coordinates N49°00ı, E014°00 apart from the airfield symbol and the ATZ boundaries symbol, not any navigational aid is depicted. Therefore, the only option which represents a correct type, identifictaion and frequency of a navigational aid is VOR/DME RDG 114.70 MHz (near N49°00, E012°30).",
