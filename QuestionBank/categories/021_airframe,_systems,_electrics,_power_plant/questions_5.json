As both would actually be covered by the same correct answer, there is no problem. We strongly believe that it is talking about pressure control, but we can cover all bases here anyway. Temperature control of the air conditioning system in a jet transport aircraft comes from controlling the mixing of two streams of air - hot and cold - whch come from different stages of the bleed air conditioning packs. Some aircraft have automatic valves to control the internal temperature of the air, if this does not work, the valve can sometimes be manually controlled from the flight deck. This all depends on the aircraft type of course. PRESSURISATION SYSTEMS Cabin pressurization is achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. The operation of the outflow valves is governed by the pressure controller when in automatic control => as the cabin pressure changes, the controller automatically transmits a signal to the outflow valves. If the automatic control fails, the position of the outflow valve can be controlled by the flight crew in manual mode => the outflow valve position can be varied by means of the main outflow valve control and with reference to the cabin altitude gauge and the valve position indicator.",

So the difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure. With a drop in cabin pressure the difference between the cabin pressure and ambient pressure will decrease. Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10000ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500ft/min for the climb and 300ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

Therefore, the usual (and very easy) answer of the bleed air duct leak indicator light is no longer correct, because there is no such light in the cabin, only in the flight deck. The bleed air in the pneumatic system is usually fed from a \"bleed air source\" in a gas turbine engine, which is effectively just air that has already gone through some of the compressor stages and is siphoned off to pressurise the system (not burnt). It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. Thankfully, it is usually kept far away from passengers, for just this reason, so the first sign of a duct leak in the cabin would likely be reduction in airflow coming through the vents. This is because less air is fed into the air conditioning packs (as some of it has leaked out), so less air is able to be cooled and sent to the cabin vents. The cabin pressure will not drop rapidly as the loss of pressurisation is small, depending on the location of the duct leak, and the outflow valve will close naturally to keep the remaining pressure inside. It could be argued that the cabin temperature could rise above normal limits, but this is highly dependent on the location of the leak. The majority of the bleed air lines exist in the wings and underbelly of the aircraft (mostly unpressurised areas) so the chance of the passenger cabin being heated by this is quite slim, but some aircraft equipment could certainly be damaged.",

Additionally, engines can require alternate sources of intake air or ice protected inlets. WINDSHIELD ICE CONTROL. Most aircraft are equipped with a defroster consisting of vents that direct heated air across the windshield on the inside of the cabin. To prevent ice formation, most windshields are electrically heated: small wires or electrically conductive materials are embedded in the windshield or in a panel of glass installed over the exterior of the windshield. By passing electric current through the windshield or panel, sufficient heat is produced to prevent ice formation. OTHER ICE CONTROL SYSTEMS. The pitot tube and static port openings, fuel vents and stall warning sensors, typically contain electrical elements to prevent ice formation. These elements can be checked during a pre-flight inspection by touching each component when the heat is on",

Hot air anti-ice systems are installed on most turbojet and some turboprop aeroplanes. This is because a turbine engine has an easy source of hot air that can be used to heat aerofoil leading edges or engine cowlings. This is \"bleed\" air, which is taken from the high pressure, hot air in the engine compressors. Engine cowlings: On a turbojet/turbofan engine, the leading edges of the cowlings are usually heated with hot bleed air as an \"anti-icing\" system, which prevents ice from forming in the first place. Wing leading edges: These can be fed by hot bleed air, but require much greater volumes of bleed air than the engine cowlings, so are more commonly used as a \"de-icing\" system, where ice that has already formed can be removed.",

The different parts of the aircraft that require ice protection are the wing leading edges, the tail leading edges, any probes or vanes, the windscreen, the engine inlets and the propellers (if fitted). All these components can be de-iced when ice is detected, except for the engines, which have to be anti-iced, as any ice build up could fall into the engine when dislodged and potentially cause a flame out or even damage. On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. Anti-ice systems in turbine-type engines often use engine bleed air to prevent ice formation by heating or otherwise managing the temperature of critical components to ensure safe and efficient engine operation.",

Piezoelectric sensors are very interesting. They create a linkage between movement and electric signals via the stress of a particular \"piezoelectric\" crystal. In this case, they are used to measure vibrations of an ice detection sensor. This is usually a small rod that sticks out from the aircraft fuselage and vibrates at the natural frequency of the rod, but any ice buildup will cause that natural frequency to change, and this change will be sensed by the piezoelectric crystal, triggering a warning for the pilots that ice buildup has been detected.",

AEROFOIL ICE CONTROL To protect wing and tail surface leading edges from icing, most aeroplanes use pneumatic devices. On many reciprocating-engine and turboprop airplanes, de-icing boots are pneumatically inflated to break the ice, which allows it to be carried away by the airstream. In another system, primarily used by turbine-powered aeroplanes, heated air is directed through ducting in the aerofoil leading edge, to thermally prevent ice from forming. This is referred to as thermal anti-ice system. Thermal Anti-ice Systems Thermal anti-ice systems heat the surfaces on aeroplanes to prevent ice formation. Hot air anti-ice systems are installed on some turbojet and turboprop aeroplanes. This is because a turbine engine has a ready source of hot air that can be used to heat aerofoil leading edges. In this system, air is diverted “bled” from one of the later stages of the compressor section of the engine and piped through ducts to the leading edges of the aerofoil to be protected. Engine inlets can also be protected with hot bleed air, or can be electrically heated.",

They are quite simple to remember, de-icing is the process of getting rid of the ice that has already formed, whereas anti-icing is preventing the ice from forming at all. The different parts of the aircraft that require ice protection are the wing leading edges, the tail leading edges, any probes or vanes, the windscreen, the engine inlets and the propellers (if fitted). All these components can be de-iced when ice is detected, except for the engines, which have to be anti-iced, as any ice build up could fall into the engine when dislodged and potentially cause a flame out or even damage. On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. As for this question, the answers beginning with \"prevents\" are correct (anti-icing rather than de-icing), and the ice does not form on the trailing edge of a wing (it can flow over the trailing edge in extreme cases but does not \"form\" there), so therefore the correct answer has to be that it \"prevents the formation of ice on engine inlets.\"",

Some aircraft are fitted with ice detection systems which show the pilots a warning when ice acccumulation has been detected, often on a small probe. Some aircraft rely simply on visual references, such as the buildup of ice on the windshield wipers, or other items within view of the pilots. This is a design consideration of the aircraft, and the pilots must be able to see indications of ice accretion as they occur, particularly in large jet aircraft where the pilot cannot see the wing easily. As the ice warning is a design consideration, the indications of icing should be visible when the pilot has the correct eye reference position. If they do not have the correct eye position, then they may not be able to see the ice build up, preventing them from performing the correct procedures.",

This compressed air driven from the compressor is known as bleed air. When selecting the bleed air ‘ON’ some of the air will be sucked out of the normal flow inside the engine and will induce some inconveniences and risks. In fact, the mass flow of air will be reduced, which will increase the engine’s overall temperature, especially the turbine temperature since less air is available for cooling. It also increases specific fuel consumption and the EGT and the power output (or thrust) will be decreased, in other words, aircraft, and more precisely engine performance will greatly be decreased. Because of all this, it is normal to see PACKS OFF take-off, since all the available power is needed during this critical stage of the flight.

Hot air anti-ice systems are installed on some turbojet and turboprop aeroplanes. This is because a turbine engine has a ready source of hot air that can be used to heat aerofoil leading edges. In this system, air is diverted “bled” from one of the later stages of the compressor section of the engine and piped through ducts to the leading edges of the aerofoil to be protected. Engine inlets can also be protected with hot bleed air, or can be electrically heated.",

Modern systems use leading edge panels that are either laser drilled with thousands of small holes, or fitted with fine stainless steel mesh. In operation, a pump forces a mixture of ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and water through the holes. This fluid runs back over the surface, forming a thin liquid film that prevents structural ice from forming.

Many large and high-performance turbine aircraft use a resistance type electric fuel temperature sender in a main fuel tank for this purpose. Fuel Pressure. Monitoring fuel pressure can give the pilot early warning of a fuel system related malfunction. Verification that the fuel system is delivering fuel to the fuel metering device can be critical. Simple light reciprocating-engine aircraft typically utilize a direct reading Bourdon tube pressure gauge. A more complex aircraft may have a sensor with a transducer located at the fuel inlet to the metering device that sends electrical signals to a cockpit gauge. Fuel Quantity. All aircraft fuel systems must have some form of fuel quantity indicator. These devices vary widely depending on the complexity of the fuel system and the aircraft on which they are installed. Simple direct reading indicators is possible only on light aircraft in which the fuel tanks are in close proximity to the cockpit. Other light aircraft and larger aircraft require electric indicators or electronic capacitance type indicators.",

            "explanation": "Engine failures are not always emergency situations. In a 4-engine aircraft, the loss of one engine means you now have a little thrust assymetry and 75% of the aircraft's maximum thrust avialable. If at cruising level, this might not be enough to maintain altitude, and a drift-down procedure may be required. Remember that this is a lot less bad than losing one engine out of two. One thing to think about is that the right hand engines are usually fed from the right hand wing tanks, and the left hand engines from the left wing tanks. If an engine fails and the aircraft is not going to land immediately, then it is a good idea to make sure all available fuel pumps are on and open up the crossfeed valve (if available) to make sure that the engines all have access to fuel, and that one tank does not run dry before the others. This also helps to keep the aircraft balanced. None of the other options are really necessary in the situation, and descending would make the engines less fuel efficient (though would allow for higher thrust output).",

The sealed skin and structural members provide the highest volume of space available with the lowest weight => this is otherwise unused space inside the wings. Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have wet wings. RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. As you can imagine, the area of the plates and the distance between is not going to change over time, they’re fixed. So, the only variable is going to be the dielectric.

Jet fuel is kerosene based, and is very similar to diesel fuel in many ways, but lacks the same lubricating effect of motor diesel, so the diesel piston engines are specially modified or developed to remove this issue. In terms of which jet fuels can be used in a diesel aero-engine, please see the above annex for the generic AFM for a Diamond DA-42 which uses diesel based aero-engines. You will note that there are different fuel names and specifications for different world regions, but in Europe and the US, Jet A-1 is by far the most common. Even diesel itself can only be used in the DA42 if certain modifications are in place. The inclusion of AVTUR in the options is a little troubling. Please understand that Jet A-1 is certainly most correct, both theoretically and in reality when flying around Europe, but AVTUR (aviation turbine fuel) is a word that can mean a few different things. It can be an umbrella term for all aviation turbine fuels, but its first use was as a term for JP-1, an early jet fuel developed by the US military, which is not still used today.",

These filters are typically installed at the fuel tank outlet. Subsequently, the HP fuel pump elevates the fuel pressure to fulfill the requirements of the engine-driven fuel pump and fuel injectors. Meanwhile, the FUEL CONTROL UNIT (FCU) acts as a precise fuel metering device, regulating fuel flow to the engine. Due to their high precision, it's crucial for the fuel supplied to them to be clean and free of contaminants. Micronic filters, positioned before the FCU, ensure this cleanliness. These fuel filters are positioned upstream of the FCU to safeguard the delicate components within both the HP fuel pump and the FCU.

            ],
            "explanation": "1. In a piston engine, the fuel supply must be gravity-fed fuel. - incorrect In piston-engine aircraft, fuel can be supplied to the engine through either gravity-fed or pump-fed systems. Gravity-fed fuel systems are typically found in high-wing aircraft, where the fuel tanks are positioned above the engine. Gravity allows the fuel to flow naturally from the tanks to the engine without the need for fuel pumps. However, many piston-engine aircraft, especially those with low-wing configurations, use fuel pumps because the fuel tanks are located below the engine. In these cases, mechanical or electric fuel pumps are essential to supply fuel to the engine. Therefore, it is not mandatory for piston-engine fuel supplies to be gravity-fed; the fuel supply method depends on the aircraft's design. 2. In gas turbine engines, fuel tanks must be in low wing configuration. - incorrect Gas turbine engine aircraft can have fuel tanks in various configurations, not exclusively in low-wing designs. While many jet aircraft feature low-wing configurations with fuel tanks integrated into the wings, there are numerous exceptions. High-wing aircraft, such as some turboprop and cargo planes (e.g., the C-130 Hercules), also use gas turbine engines and have fuel tanks located in the wings or fuselage. The placement of fuel tanks in gas turbine engine aircraft is determined by factors like aircraft size, purpose, and design requirements—not solely by the engine type. Therefore, it is not a necessity for gas turbine engine fuel tanks to be in a low-wing configuration.",

RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accomodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is almost exactly the same as question 218090, but the correct answer is very slightly different. The answer to question 218090 is slightly more correct in our opinion, but this one is also sufficiently correct, in comparison to the other options. The priming system consists of a priming pump that will deliver fuel to the induction manifold. Its whole purpose is to inject additional fuel in the cylinders intake ports to assist the engine start. As this extra fuel now lines the intake ports/inlet manifold to one or more of the cylinders, and is very volatile, it will evaporate into the air flowing into the cylinders, giving the necessary fuel/air mixture to start the engine. The \"inlet manifold\" is the area just before the intake air gets split up to each individual cylinder, so priming this area will prime the fuel to all cylinders, but we consider this to be almost exactly the same meaning as injecting fuel into the intake ports. In the absence of such a system, it is possible (but more likely to cause a fire hazard) to deliver more fuel to the cylinders by pumping the throttle lever which will act on the accelerator pump and deliver more fuel from the carburettor. Unfortunately, this method coats the earlier intake lines with fuel, and may therefore catch fire unintentionally if the excess fuel drips onto hot components, etc. The priming pump may be electrical or manual, and will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the nozzles at the inlet manifold/intake ports. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs. Whilst pumping the throttle can work, it is not really made for \"priming\", more providing extra fuel to the engine once running, and is therefore not preferred. There is no hole in the spark plug for fuel, and please, please don't rotate a propeller with the throttle wide open. If the magnetos are unintentionally on or the engine has a hot spot then a cylinder could fire and cause serious injury.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question isn't very good, and there are two slightly correct answers here (none that we consider fully correct), but we believe that one is more correct than the other. AIRCRAFT FUEL TANKS INTEGRAL TANKS: Integral Tanks are used on all modern large passenger aircraft and, as its name suggests, a tank is formed as an unit within the airframe structure by sealing part of the structure of the wings or fuselage with a fuel resistant two-part sealant. The sealed skin and structural members provide the highest volume of space available with the lowest weight => this is otherwise unused space inside the wings. Aircraft with integral fuel tanks in the wings are said to have \"wet wings\". RIGID TANKS: A rigid tank is a sealed metal container strapped into a compartment designed to accommodate the tank in the airframe structure. They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. They are common on light aircraft. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. So out of these options then, both mentioning maintenance are incorrect. Fuel bladder tanks are great for maintenance as they can be removed completely if necessary. Of the other two options, \"easily punctured\" is neither fully correct nor incorrect, as yes, they can be punctured, of course, but they are often made puncture resistant and may even be self-sealing against punctures. The wrinkles are the only potential problem here, and whilst they are relatively unlikely due to the fixing of the bladder to the aircraft structure, badly designed or incorrectly fixed tanks could easily wrinkle, at which point a few precious litres of fuel become unusable by the engines, and this is certainly a problem.",

Fuel flow meters can indeed measure the mass of fuel passing through them per unit of time. Mass flow measurement is often preferred in aviation because it provides more accurate information about the actual amount of fuel being consumed by the aircraft's engines. \"Fuel flow can be measured by using a fuel flow meter, which measures the volume of fuel passing through it per unit of time.\" This statement is correct. While some fuel flow meters may provide volume measurements, they are less common in aviation applications. Volume measurements are less accurate for fuel flow because the density of fuel can vary, particularly with changes in temperature and altitude. Mass flow measurement provides a more consistent and accurate indication of fuel consumption. In light aircraft with reciprocating engines, systems have been designed to measure fuel volume.",

To address the incorrect options: The fuel is not transferred between tanks, fuel balancing will usually be done by feeding an engine from the other side fuel tank to burn more fuel from that side. Unusable fuel being used for engine cooling would be a terrible idea, as the fuel could ignite and cause an engine fire.

Turbine engine Fuel Control Units (FCU) are extremely close tolerance devices. It is imperative that fuel delivered to them is clean and contaminant free. The use of micronic filters located before the FCU makes this possible. These fuel filters are located somewhere before the FCU (not after), controlling the delicate control components within the HP fuel pump and the fuel control unit.

Given the statements, we think the question will be laid out in this way, but this is not assured yet. It could also be a choice of which statements are correct (1, 2 and 4, etc.) with different wording for the statements. For a gravity fed fuel system to work, there is no pump needed to get the fuel to the engine from the tanks (booster pumps are often fitted for use during critical phases of flight), so the fuel is pressurised and fed from the tank(s) to the engine by gravity. The fuel must therefore be stored above the carburettor and engine, such as in a high wing aircraft like a Cessna 152. The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options; A fuel gauge is just as required as it would be in any fuel system. In fact, in some gravity fed aircraft, you can actually see the fuel in the tanks, so they act as their own fuel gauges. We're not sure if the examiner is saying that gravity fed aircraft don't need fuel gauges, or they don't need them any more that pump-fed aircraft do. As mentioned above, the engine could still be fuel injected. The fuel would be gravity fed from the tanks to the high pressure pump just before the fuel injectors. We would say that this is not \"true\" gravity feeding, but it seems to still count, particularly as a low pressure pump is not required to get the fuel out of the tanks. They don't need an electric fuel pump to operate (but may have a boost pump fitted for crucial phases of flight).",

This is particularly useful with multi-engine aircraft which can have engine failures, to allow fuel balancing in that eventuality. Pressure feed fuel systems are the opposite of purely gravity fed fuel systems, where the tank must be sufficiently over the engine to push the fuel through the lines to the engine. Pressure feed systems have a few advantages over gravity fed fuel systems: The aircraft can be more manoeuvrable as the fuel feeding will not stop if the local gravity changes (during harsh manoeuvres). The fuel flow is more consistent due to higher pressure, less chance of vapour lock and also during manoeuvring the fuel flow will not cut out. The fuel tanks can be anywhere in the aircraft and be pumped to engines which can be anywhere, unlike gravity fed systems which have obviously very strict requirements. Fuel can also be cross-fed, etc. to balance tanks. This makes the aircraft design much more flexible. Disadvantages of pressure feed systems include the fact that gravity fed systems are less complex and therefore reduce weight. They are also not reliant on electric or engine driven fuel pumps.",

Jet B is much rarer, but is used for aircraft that operate in very cold climates, and has a freezing point of -60°C. Jet B has a lower freezing point, but also a lower flash point, meaning that it could set on fire if lit at normal ground temperatures. This is why it is known as a \"wide cut fuel\", and it is not approved for commercial air transport in the EU.

As yet we are happy with this as the correct answer, but confirmation would be very useful, thank you! The wording of this question is very misleading in our opinion, as without type-specific knowledge, this is very difficult to answer, but we will try and give you the best information we can. Fuel jettisoning systems are required on an aircraft when there is a large difference between the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and the maximum landing weight (MLW). For a B737 for instance, there is a large difference between these two figures, however overweight landings are approved up to the MTOW of the aircraft if necessary, so no fuel jettison system is required, as any issues in flight, the crew can just perform an overweight landing as soon as necessary. On a larger aircraft, however, the maximum landing weight can be 100 tonnes less than the MTOW, so fuel jettison systems are necessary. Fuel jettison systems are obviously an inherent threat, as anything that removes fuel (and therefore airborne time) from the aircraft is at a high risk of a small error having big consequences. This is why there are protections in place. For starters, jettison systems are usually separate systems from those which feed the engines. Checking some aircraft types which have fuel jettisoning, the B777 has separate jettison pumps that go through specific jettison lines to the jettison valves, and the A340 has jettison valves placed on the refuelling/transfer system. This means that there is no single point of failure which causes unwanted jettisoning of fuel, as if the valves became fixed open, the pumps could be switched off, etc. We have been able to attach a replication of the fuel schematic for a 4 engine aircraft above, notice that the two fuel systems (refuelling/transfer/jettison vs the engine feed) are separate. Also, there is a further method of protection in the tanks, and there is usually a standpipe or other mechanical method that prevents fuel being jettisoned below a certain fuel tank level. This means that there is always enough fuel left for approach and landing (likely also a missed approach), even if the fuel jettison system got rid of everything. This protects for multiple system failures and some amount of human error.",

It vapourises because the fuel pressure is too low, and this allows the molecules to very easily break apart into a gas (remember that some types of fuel are very volatile and prone to becoming a gas anyway). This is effectively the same as the fuel \"boiling\", but due to low pressure rather than very high temperature. This is quite similar to how water boils at a much lower temperature at high altitudes, and you'll struggle to get a good cup of tea on top of Mount Everest, as the water never gets hot enough, boiling at around 65ºC. Low pressure reduces boiling points, as the molecules don't want to be together as much. To prevent vapour locking and cavitation, a low-pressure pump is fitted to the feed line and will supply fuel from the tanks at suitable pressure and flow. Under certain circumstances when the engine is very hot, vapor lock can also occur in the injector lines and prevent the fuel from being correctly delivered to the cylinders.",

They are simple and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. However, this type of tank adds extra weight. FLEXIBLE TANKS/FUEL BLADDERS: Flexible tanks are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of the aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. A bladder tank contains most of the features and components of a rigid tank but does not require as large an opening in the aircraft skin to install. It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks.",

            "explanation": "Often aircraft will have a CG that changes significantly during flight, mostly due to fuel burn. This has an affect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is oposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually tranferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Conversely, light aircraft gauge quantity by measuring volume (in liters and gallons) through the adjustment of resistance using a float. However, this method is susceptible to maneuvering inaccuracies and cannot adjust for density fluctuations. Further reading: The working principle of a capacitance-type fuel gauging system is based on the variation of the capacitor’s dielectric. The dielectric is the solution found between the two plates of the capacitor, so in our system, they are the fuel and the air. The plates of the capacitor can hold only a certain amount of electric charge. This amount depends on the distance between the two plates, the area of the plates and the insulating properties of the dielectric. The float-type fuel gauging system consists of a simple mechanical float sitting on the fuel level and linked via a mechanical arm to a gauge indicating the volume. One of the main limitations of the volume indicating systems is that temperature variations will impact the reading of the tanks’ actual fuel quantity. The reading will also be imprecise during maneuvers, accelerations, and turbulence; the reading will only be reliable in straight and level flight.",

The fuel must therefore be stored above the carburettor and engine, such as in a high wing aircraft like a Cessna 152. The weight of fuel on the rest of the fuel in the lines is what pushes it into the carburettor (for a carburetted engine). If the engine was injected, a high pressure pump would be required before the injector to provide the injection pressure, but the system could still be “gravity fed”. As for the other options, they are just as necessary (or less so) in a gravity fed system as in a fuel pump driven system. Fuel flow and pressure sensors are useful in some systems, but not required in most, and a pressure relief valve is much less required in a gravity fed system as the pressures involved are usually much lower.",

            "explanation": "The fuel system in the annex is from the Boeing 737, and is representative of many large commercial jet transport aircraft. This question poses the scenario of having low fuel in the left tank for some reason, and asks how to deal with this. Of course, as with any imbalance, crossfeed is usually the way forward. It is important to note that crossfeed does not transfer fuel between tanks, but instead allows both engines to be fed from the other tank. By opening the crossfeed valve, either engine can take fuel from either tank, so how do we stop the system from running out of fuel in the left tank? We have to make sure that the pressure of fuel being pumped out of the right tank is significantly higher than the pressure of fuel from the left tank. We do this by turning the Low Pressure AC fuel pumps from the left tank off completely, and leaving the fuel pumps on from the right tank, so the fuel is taken from the right tank as priority. None of this fuel can flow into the left tank due to the non-return valves, so just feeds both engines at once, burning down the amount of fuel in the right tank until the tanks are equal. Note that in the crossfeeding scenario, if the right tank pumps failed, then both engines could be fed from the suction of the HP engine pumps from either tank, without any AC pumps required, it is just less ideal and more prone to problems. Note: do not worry that the cross-feed valve is open in the question figure, it is just a figure to help you see the layout of the fuel system.",

Remark: For completion of list, please see 021.08 01.02 (02). Often aircraft will have a CG that changes significantly during flight, mostly due to fuel burn. This has an effect on the aircraft's flight characteristics, being that a forward CG requires more nose-up trim, which causes a downforce on the horizontal stabiliser, and therefore means that the main wing is lifting a heavier load. This leads to increased drag (sometimes called trim drag), increased stall speed, lower maximum altitude, etc. This is opposed to an aft CG, which reduces all those negative effects, for the trade-off of reduced stability. This makes it useful for us to be able to change the CG of the aircraft so we do not have to contend with as much trim drag. To do this, a trim fuel tank can be fitted in the rear of the aircraft, which is usually transferred and then burnt at the correct time to ensure peak efficiency, with the best possible CG position. This is the reason they are fitted in the tail of the aircraft, as that is the place furthest away from the CG, to have the greatest effect. An interesting side note, Concorde had such trim tanks in the tail of the aircraft, and fuel would be pumped to them to bring the CG backwards when accelerating through the transonic range, in order to counteract the effects of Mach tuck. This drastically reduced the drag of a conventional Mach trim system, and the reverse would occur when the aircraft decelerated back to subsonic flight again.",

Please send any further feedback to us via the comments, the question feedback section, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Vents in fuel tanks can hold two purposes. Some vents allow excess fuel to escape if the tanks have been overfilled or if the fuel has expanded due to heating. All vents provide atmospheric pressure to the fuel tank, so the space inside doesn't form a small vacuum as the fuel is burnt. Any such vacuum effect could cause problems with taking the fuel out of the tank towards the engines. Most vents provide slightly more than atmospheric pressure by pointing forwards and making use of the ram air to put a \"head of pressure\" on the fuel tank, helping the fuel pumps and reducing cavitation.",

It is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment.

Just before the engines are the high pressure (HP) pumps which provide the correct pressure to the fuel nozzles. The suction from these pumps can suck fuel straight out of the tanks, through the fuel lines, however, this is usually supplemented by the addition of low pressure (LP) fuel pumps to suck fuel out of the tank and push it into the fuel lines. This pressurises the fuel in the lines, preventing vapour lock and cavitation. Cavitation is where an object moves through a liquid too quickly, and \"tears\" the liquid, creating gas bubbles in the liquid, even when no gas is present. This can reduce the output pressure of the pumps and therefore reduce fuel flow to the engines. It is much harder to do when the liquid is under pressure, so is more likely at high altitude when the air pressure is not pushing down on the liquid as much inside the fuel tanks. As discussed above, cavitation is reduced by pressurising the fuel, in smaller aircraft by using ram air to push down on the fuel in the tank, and in larger aircraft with LP pumps to pressurise the fuel lines. The failure of LP pumps does not stop the engines from receiving fuel, but cavitation and vapour lock (gas bubbles in the fuel lines) can cause fuel interruptions to the engine.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on student feedback, the official question includes an attachment illustrating the conditions mentioned in the question text. However, we have not yet obtained access to this official attachment. Whenever there is an unexpected fuel quantity indication, a message related to fuel in the FMC or engine display, or an imbalance condition arises, it's essential to consider the possibility of a fuel leak. Detecting a fuel leak can be aided by maintaining a fuel log and comparing the actual fuel burn to the planned fuel burn as part of the flight. It's important to note that there is no specific onboard warning for a fuel leak; it must be identified through changes or discrepancies in expected fuel consumption. Before engaging in any crossfeeding operations, it's crucial to ascertain that a fuel leak is not the root cause of the issue, as it could lead to total fuel loss. Pay close attention to parameters such as fuel flow, fuel usage, and total fuel quantity indications before deactivating any pump switches. If there is suspicion of an inflight fuel leak, take the following steps: turn off the fuel pumps for the center wing tank and close the crossfeed valve. Monitor the fuel tank quantity for any unusual drops and be alert to signs of a fuel imbalance, as these indicators can help confirm the presence of an engine fuel leak. Once an engine fuel leak is confirmed, either through visual observation or flight deck indications, it's imperative to shut down the affected engine to halt the leak and preserve the remaining fuel. After shutting down the affected engine, resume normal fuel management procedures. All remaining fuel can be utilized to power the operational engine safely.",

Circuit breakers are special because even after the circuit breaker has blown, the circuit can be closed again. Therefore restoring the circuit and potentially powering important systems. Hence a circuit breaker is resettable. However, a Circuit Breaker should not be reset too often - If a circuit breaker trips, it means there is more current flowing through that circuit breaker than its trip current - if you keep resetting a circuit breaker, you basically keep allowing the overcurrent to flow, which could potentially damage systems. => Therefore, statement (3) is correct. FUSES: are a sacrificial device that is destroyed and needs to be replaced or rewired to be functional again when tripped. Therefore they are not resettable. When it’s time to replace the fuse, it’s important to find one that has the same amperage and voltage rating. => Therefore, statement (6) is correct.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.09.01.07.06: Explain the risk of fire resulting from excessive heat in a circuit subjected to overcurrent. Circuit overload protections exist for very good reason. If an electrical consumer ever attempts to pull more current that it should be allowed to have, then that should be stopped, by the blowing of a fuse (which has to then be changed) or the popping of a circuit breaker. This serves many reasons. If a consumer tries to pull much more power than usual, then it may be that the consumer has broken somehow, or a short-circuit has occurred somewhere, which is allowing all the electricity an easy path to ground. This will allow a high level of current through that circuit, which could heat up rapidly, and most circuits are not built for that level of heat or current, so could easily start an electrical fire. This may also remove so much of the available current in the system as well, potentially starving the other consumers of power. In this case, the circuit protection has not worked, so the circuit can overcurrent. This is why we have circuit breakers and fuses, so that if too much current passes through our circuit, the fuse would melt, breaking the connection, or, in a circuit breaker, the excess current would cause a solenoid to pop out the breaker, breaking the connection. Circuit breakers may be reset once (after a few seconds to let the circuit cool), but if they pop again, there is a problem with the circuit and they should not be reset again. There are \"slow blow\" fuses and circuit breakers, which take a few seconds of overcurrent to break the connection, for those circuits which are allowed to go over a certain current for a transient time only. Note: This is a very similar question to Q216001, but with different options.",

A typical starter generator is described. A motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy while generator converts mechanical energy into energy. This is because when current flows through the coil it induces a magnetic field and when its poles are identical to the permanent magnet at that instant of time which is placed inside the motor, the armature rotates. This law is invertible. i.e. when a coil is rotated between two permanent magnets of opposite polarity along the axis which is perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force, current is induced in the coil due to the change in magnetic flux associated with the coil. The starter generator of an aircraft first starts the aeroplane’s engine, functioning as a motor. After the engine has been started, it turns into a generator.",

            "explanation": "In the diagram you can see the most basic type of thermal circuit breaker. Thermal circuit breakers consist of two different types of metals, that are specifically chosen for their expansion rates for a certain temperature. Usually the top metal (shown in red) is copper, and the bottom metal (shown in blue) is iron. As the current exceeds a set maximum, the metals will start to expand due to the excess heat. Now, because of the different expansion rates of the materials, the metal strip will bend and disconnect from the circuit, hence preventing anymore current from flowing. Why is the correct answer “protects the system in the event of a prolonged overcurrent”: The overcurrent needs to be prolonged so that the materials have time to heat up and start expanding. Usually when an overcurrent occurs, the current is so much higher than the maximum current that it takes very little time (under a second) for the circuit breaker to trip. However, low over-currents can take minutes to cause the breaker to trip. The correct answer needs to contain overcurrent because thermal circuit breakers “protect” from overcurrent, they are not designed to trip at a specific surrounding air temperature. Even if a high temperature could trip the circuit breakers!",

There are a few different types of lithium batteries, Lithium ion, Lithium metal and lithium polymer. They all have slightly different characteristics, but share a similar level of danger. They are all susceptible to thermal runaway. This can come about in a few different ways, depending on the battery type. Lithium ion batteries, for instance, are most susceptible to thermal runaway through overcharging/overheating and damage, which can stop the battery controller from working correctly. Some of the batteries are also very susceptible to swelling with age and internal pressure, and internal short circuits can also cause thermal runaway. This makes lithium batteries dangerous goods, and the vast majority of them are \"forbidden\" on aircraft, except for certain amounts in hand luggage and as crew spares, which can be monitored and dealt with in case of a fire. This is important because a lithium fire burns incredibly hot and is almost impossible to put out without specialist equipment. This does mean that the scenario in this question is highly unlikely to occur, but as they are dangerous goods, the crew must be notified via a NOTOC, and of the options given, only the one stating thermal runaway is correct (Although some of the options are not verified so will likely be different in the exam).",

Circuit overload protections exist for very good reason. If an electrical consumer ever attempts to pull more current that it should be allowed to have, then that should be stopped, by the blowing of a fuse (which has to then be changed) or the popping of a circuit breaker. This serves many reasons. If a consumer tries to pull much more power than usual, then it may be that the consumer has broken somehow, or a short-circuit has occurred somewhere, which is allowing all the electricity an easy path to ground. This will allow a high level of current through that circuit, which could heat up rapidly, and most circuits are not built for that level of heat or current, so could easily start an electrical fire. This may also remove so much of the available current in the system as well, potentially starving the other consumers of power. In this case, the circuit protection has not worked, so the circuit can overcurrent. This is why we have circuit breakers and fuses, so that if too much current passes through our circuit, the fuse would melt, breaking the connection, or, in a circuit breaker, the excess current would cause a solenoid to pop out the breaker, breaking the connection. Circuit breakers may be reset once (after a few seconds to let the circuit cool), but if they pop again, there is a problem with the circuit and they should not be reset again. There are \"slow blow\" fuses and circuit breakers, which take a few seconds of overcurrent to break the connection, for those circuits which are allowed to go over a certain current for a transient time only.",

As an IDG is a self contained system, the fault light in the cockpit can tell us of any problems, and sometimes there is a temperature dial that can tell us of an overheat in the lubricating oil, etc., which might require the IDG to be disconnected from the engine gearbox. If a pilot has to manually disconnect the IDG, they must operate the IDG disconnect switch. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When operated, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reconnected by maintenance, after engine shutdown. Many IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers, so that electrical supply is unavailable for the remainder of the flight.",

A fuse is a thermal circuit protection device which protects distribution system cables and components against excessive electrical current when failures occur. Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accommodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. Any failures (such as short circuits) could cause a failure of the circuit and its components, which may even heat up enough to start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. In this case, a small overload of 4 amps, for instance, would not be protected against, and there is an increased risk of electrical fire. As for the other options: It is not completely safe to do. It will not cause the circuit to stop working. A fire will not immediately start, but is just more likely, in case of failure of other components.",

Housing lithium-ion batteries in a vented metal casing can help to prevent them from becoming a fire hazard by reducing the risk of thermal runaway, which is a condition in which the battery temperature increases rapidly, potentially leading to ignition. The vented casing allows for dissipation of heat and venting of any flammable gases that may be generated during thermal runaway. The other options listed are not effective in preventing lithium-ion batteries from becoming a fire hazard. Installing a fuse on the positive pole of the battery does not address the root cause of thermal runaway, and may not provide adequate protection against ignition. Placing a halon fire extinguisher in the compartment with the battery is not a proactive measure to prevent thermal runaway and may not be able to effectively extinguish a fire that has already started. Continuously charging the battery during flight also does not prevent thermal runaway, and may actually increase the risk of thermal runaway if the battery is overcharged or damaged in some way.",

An alternating current (AC) is passed through one of the wires, what will happen in the other wire. This is a question about magnetic fields and the motor effect. When a current is passed through a wire, it creates a circular magnetic field going around that wire, which affects any free electrons in the vicinity, movement of electrons (current) is directly linked to magnetic fields. The other wire nearby will feel this magnetic field and electrons will begin to move because of it, creating a current. It is not the physical presence of the magnetic field which causes the EMF (electromotive force) that creates the current though, it is the change in magnetic field. There are magnetic fields present all around us (notable that of the Earth which makes our compasses work), but these do not create electricity, unless they change. The question mentions an alternating current, which means that the current goes forwards and backwards in the wire, changing a few times per second (50 times per second is normal for mains power supply - depending on the country), this means that the magnetic field around the first wire is continuously created and destroyed, then created and destroyed in the opposite direction, then back to the first direction, etc. This creates a similar backwards, forwards, backwards, forwards current in the second wire, which is again called alternating current (AC)! This effect can be used to create movement in motors (by creating opposing magnetic fields) and to generate/transfer electricity, but remember, energy cannot come from nowhere, so there must be an opposite effect (called back EMF) somewhere in the system. Note: This came from feedback in RNAV a while ago, but it is certainly an AGK-electrics question, so any feedback about whether this question is still active, etc. would be very useful, thank you.",

The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swash plate. The angle of the swash plate will either limit or increase the oil flow towards the hydraulic and in turn affect the rpm of the engine. The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turned is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator.

Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accomodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. It could cause a failure of the device burn it up, start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a severe risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. If the circuit does encounter an overload condition then that part of the circuit that the fuse protects may become a fire hazard. Note: Some students have confirmed that the option \"Overcurrent might go undetected and cause a fire.\" was correct in their exams and confirmed that the option \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" was not within the available answers. However, we have also received a couple of feedback confirming the correct option to be \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" which makes us believe that there are at least two similar question.",

Both real and reactive loads must be matched to ensure correct load sharing between AC generators operating in parallel. When they are connected in parallel, the reactive loads are balanced by regulating the energizing current (exciter field current). On the other side, real load sharing is achieved by increasing the torque input to the lower speed alternator and vice versa. Real Loads – actual working load directly related to the mechanical power (torque) supplied to the alternator (the engine or the CSDU). It is called “real” because it is dependent on the torque at its output shaft available for supplying aircraft’s electrical equipment. Reactive Loads – vector sum of inductive and capacitive currents and voltages (in KVAR).",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOR gate – OR gate + NOT = inverted \"OR\" output, symbolized again by the small circle at the output of the OR gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOT gate – invert gate, used to reverse the state of the input. If input = 0, then output = 1.",

Both synchronising busses can be tied together using the SSB (split-system breaker) if required to balance a load with a generator failure.

As you can see, the Generator Control Unit (GCU) is responsible for isolating the generator in case of malfunction or deactivation by the pilots. The GCU control and protection functions are mainly performed by internal relays: The Generator Control Relay (GCR) controls the excitation of the generator, equivalent to what is called in this question as to the exciter control relay. The Power Ready Relay (PRR) that controls the Generator Line Contactor (GCL), equivalent in this question as to the generator breaker open. And the ServoValve relay (SV) that controls the IDG speed.

When the generator is running, the voltage regulator will send a DC field current to the excitor stator to supplement the magnetic field of the permanent magnets, and allow the generator's output to be controlled. The AC produced in the exciter armature will be converted into DC for the main rotor field supply in order to keep the polarity in the spinning rotor. This allows the motor to run without the need for brushes, thereby increasing lifespan. It also has a higher power to weight ratio than older methods of AC generation. There is a further addition that can be made to this system, where a third smaller generator exists on the same shaft, which has a set of spinning permanent magnets and a stationary armature. The current from the armature is rectified to provide power to the generator control systems, and to the stationary field coils of the excitation generator, and effectively takes the permanent magnets from the older style brushless AC generator, and puts them in a different place (a small thrid generator), serving a similar purpose. This can improve efficiency, and these more modern types of AC generators are also called Permanent Magnet Generators. Whichever type of AC generator that is being asked about, they both use permanent magnets for their intial excitation.",

Sources of magnetic disturbance vary and can include radio frequency transmissions, power lines, and other electrical equipment Magnetic induction describes the process whereby a magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor that either moves relative to the magnetic field or experiences a changing magnetic field passing through it. Bundling cables and wires together on an aircraft helps mitigate the risk of magnetic induction or disturbance.

It is sometimes useful to rearrange this equation to read: Energy Transferred = Power x Time In electrical terms, and this applies to any transfer of energy which goes through electrical energy (generators, motors, etc.), the power can also be calculated using the equation: Power = Voltage x Current The amount of energy transferred is therefore (putting the two formulas together): Energy = Voltage x Current x Time To address the other possible answers, voltage x current x time = energy, not power.

The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swashplate.

The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turn is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator.

Please try to remember which one you see in the exam so you can let us know in the comments if possible, thank you! Relays are widely used in aircraft electrical systems. They function as switches that use a small DC electrical current to open and close circuits carrying much larger currents (AC or DC), crucial for high-current systems operated by the crew. A small wire coil wound around a ferromagnetic core forms an electromagnet. When activated by a modest current, the electromagnet closes a switch with a hinged metallic arm that it pulls shut. When the current is switched off, the magnetic field disappears, and a spring forces the switch contacts to open. We are therefore using a very safe smaller circuit as a switch so we don't have to go anywhere near high current AC circuits, allowing them to be kept away from the flight deck, etc. The relay is physically separated (air gap/insulation) from the main circuit as otherwise the high current of the main circuit would fry the low rated relay circuit 2) The relay is not physically connected to the circuit. - Correct As mentioned above. 3) The control can be fed with DC and the high current circuit can be fed with AC. - Correct The relay’s contacts are isolated from the control coil, enabling them to handle different types of currents. DC is required for the relay (control circuit) as it needs to keep the electromagnet on at a specific strength. AC or DC can be used by the main circuit, but AC is more common.",

There are 2 equations that will tell us what we need to know here, the first is: 1. Power = Voltage x Current In essence, the energy used per electron (voltage) x the amount of electrons passing per second (current) = the energy used per second (power). 2. Power = Torque x RPM All we need from this equation is to know that power and torque (turning force) are directly proportional (RPM is not mentioned in this question, so it can be assumed to stay the same) Then a simple knowledge of how motors work, a current moving across (perpendicular to) an electric field creates force (torque): The stronger the current, or the stronger the electric field, the more the force (torque). Therefore, the torque is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. (There is an equation for this, Force = Field Strength x Current, but it is easier to just think it out than to remember the formula). Now to check each statement: 1) Mechanical torque is proportional to the voltage x current and is inversely proportional to the strength of the generated field. The first part is correct, Voltage x Current = Power, which is directly proportional to torque. The second part is incorrect, torque is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. 2) Mechanical torque is proportional to the voltage divided by the current and is proportional to the strength of the generated magnetic field. This is the exact opposite to the first one, and therefore the first part is incorrect; voltage divided by current will not be proportional to torque, but the second part is correct. Neither statement is completely correct, so both are incorrect. Note: E is used as the notation for voltage due to a thing called EMF, or electromotive force, and is the way voltage is referred to in motors. I is the standard notation for current.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.09.05.02.03: Explain the consequences of the following: rotor seizure; rotor runaway. An easy way to think about these questions is by thinking that the motor is always trying to correct for the change. Rotor seizes, current and torque increase to try and get it going faster; Rotor runaway, current and torque decrease to try and slow down. Torque is directly set by the current, so they always move in the same direction. Try to remember the diagram, that both the field coils and the armature coils are in series, so the current changes the same way in both of them at the same time. You are supposed to know a little bit more than just this, but that should be enough for the current questions we know about. Longer explanation A series wound DC electric motor is intended to have a certain torque demands put on it. A \"runaway\" is where that torque demand disappears, and all of a sudden, the armature will be spinning freely. This will initially speed the armature up, as there is no longer much resistance to spinning. This increase in speed will lead to an increase in back EMF, which is effectively the \"equal and opposite force\" on a motor, that restricts the current flow. An increase in back EMF will mean that the current flow decreases (more restriction on current flow) through both the field coil and the armature coil, which will subsequently decrease the torque in the motor. Due to the rapidly increasing speed of the motor under no load, the reduction in torque is often not at a fast enough rate to stop an overspeed, and even destruction of the motor. This depends on what safety breakers/cut-offs are involved of course.",

An integrated drive generator (IDG) consists of a Constant Speed Drive (CSD) unit and an electrical generator which are located inside one casing. As an IDG is a self contained system, the fault light in the cockpit can tell us of any problems, and sometimes there is a temperature dial that can tell us of an overheat in the lubricating oil, etc., which might require the IDG to be disconnected from the engine gearbox. If a pilot has to manually disconnect the IDG, they must operate the IDG disconnect switch. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When operated, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reconnected by maintenance, after engine shutdown. IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers, so that electrical supply is unavailable for the remainder of the flight.",

They consist of an automatic thermo-sensitive tripping device and a manually or electrically operated switch. Therefore, besides providing protection to any AC or DC circuit, they can be used to switch a circuit on and off under certain circumstances. Circuit breakers are special because even after the circuit breaker has blown, the circuit can be closed again, thus allowing to restore the circuit and potentially power important systems. We say that the circuit breaker is resettable The most common circuit breakers are the bimetallic and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too important, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch tripping the circuit breaker and break the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up there should be another solution that will be more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is correcting. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker and trip it immediately.",

This protects us aswell, as it stops current flowing through us (an electric shock) when handling wires, as we do not touch the wires directly, only the outer coating. Protecting wires is done in a similar way, but this time it is to stop any corrosion or physical damage to the internal wiring, for instance when your phone charging cable breaks at the ends due to the constant bending, leavng the wire exposed. This can be stopped by using heavier protection around the wires.",

Very low change in voltage during discharge, remains relatively the same around 1.2 volts. Low internal resistance Low maintenance Reliable Wide operating temperatures Thermal runaway: the heat generated in certain is more than what the batterie can dissipate, leading to a rapid increase in temperature. This higher temperature leads to a lower internal resistance causing an increase in charging current, therefore multiplying the effect even more.

            "explanation": "A fuse is a thermal circuit protection device which protects distribution system cables and components against excessive electrical currect when failures occur. Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accomodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. It could cause a failure of the device burn it up, start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a severe risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. If the circuit does encounter an overload condition then that part of the circuit that the fuse protects may become a fire hazard. Note: Some students have confirmed that the option \"Overcurrent might go undetected and cause a fire.\" was correct in their exams and confirmed that the option \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" was not within the available answers. However, we have also received a couple of feedback confirming the correct option to be \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" which makes us believe that there are at least two similar question.",

Back EMF is a backwards voltage that runs through a DC motor armature circuit, and increases with the speed of the motor. It acts like a motor speed regulator. EMF stands for electromotive force, and remember that EMF = voltage. Applied EMF - back EMF = net EMF Input voltage - back EMF = useful voltage Given that EMF increases with rotor speed, when the rotor speed is zero (the motor has yet to spin or has seized), there is no back EMF. Therefore, If a motor seizes, all the applied EMF is able to become net EMF, so applied EMF = net EMF. The opposite occurs if a motor suffers a runaway, where there is no load (therefore no net EMF) applied to slow the motor down. In this case, the high speed of the motor causes an increase in the back EMF, until the back EMF equals the applied EMF. This means the motor has a maximum speed that it can possible turn at, when the back EMF equals the voltage of the circuit.",

An increased resistance against rotation will result in a slower motor RPM. Consequently, back emf reduces. Such reduction will cause the current to increase. Power output = voltage x current Voltage remains constant, whilst current increases => therefore power will also increase. “2) The torque of an electrical motor can be calculated by dividing the power by the motor RPM.” Correct. In simple words, torque is the twisting force which makes a motor turn. An electrical motor’s torque can be calculated by dividing the power (voltage x current) by the motor RPM: Torque = (Voltage x Current) / RPM",

To explain this, we are going to work backwards, from what we want our final output to be, to how we get every component of that to work. A generator is made up of a magnetic field (either produced by permanent magnets or by an electric \"field\" coil which acts like a magnet) and an armature coil. One of those is spinning (rotor) and the other is stationary (stator), and which is which is decided by the input and outputs required. The armature is where AC power is generated, from the rotational energy inputted by the spinning shaft (often from an engine via constant speed drive). The basis of an AC alternator/generator (for AC output they mean the same thing) is that we wish to have the output armature windings on the stator of the main generator, so we can send the AC power straight to the bus bars. This means that the field windings on the main generator must be mounter to the rotor. This main generator is where we make the power to output to the aircraft distribution system. The voltage of the main generator is regulated by changing the strength of the magnetic field, which just means changing the voltage through the field coil. So we somehow need a way to feed voltage-regulated DC power to a spinning coil rotating at 400 Hz. We do this by having a second generator, the exciter generator, mounted on the same shaft, with the rotor this time being the armature coils (and the stator is therefore the magnetic field producer). The spinning armatures generate 3 phase AC current which is sent through a spinning rectifier to produce the field coil for the main generator. The magnetic field for the exciter generator is provided by a DC supply from the voltage regulator. If the voltage output of the main generator drops, the voltage regulator increases the voltage to the exciter field coil, and the voltage of the main generator field will increase, increasing the final output voltage. Initial excitement can be provided by a permanent magnet generator, a third generator on the same shaft, this time with a permanent magnet (field) mounter on the rotor, and the armature (stator) picking up an AC supply, then rectifying it and using it to power the exciter field or the voltage regulator, etc. When the shaft begins spinning, this will be the first thing to produce any current.",

Therefore, besides providing protection to an AC or DC circuit, they can be used to switch a circuit on and off under certain circumstances. Circuit breakers are special because even after the circuit breaker has tripped, the circuit can be closed again, thus allowing to restore the circuit and potentially power important systems. We say that the circuit breaker is resettable (which a fuse is not). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the bimetallic and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, good for some systems but not for others. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch to trip the breaker immediately.",

They are thick copper bars with holes drilled in, where wiring can be attached to be split to go to other locations/consumers within a network. They can run off one or multiple sources of power, and are much simpler and lighter than individual wiring to every generator/consumer. A short circuit is where electricity finds an easier way to flow from high voltage to low voltage. Usually, we want that electricity to flow through our consumer, which has some resistance, but if a significantly easier route exists, the amount of current running through a consumer will decrease, as an easier path exists for the electricity. If, for instance, a loose, uninsulated wire going straight to \"ground\" touched a bus bar, then all the electricity available to the bus bar would begin to flow through this wire, as it is the easiest path to go from high voltage to low voltage, completing the circuit. This would not only be a fire hazard, as the high current would heat all components up far too much, but would also mean that all connected consumers would not receive any electrical current, and would stop working. Think of it like a \"black hole\" for electricity, all the current will be sucked down the short circuit and will not feed other consumers. To avoid this eventuality, bus bars have circuit breakers that will disconnect above a certain current. This meant that the bus bar will become isolated from the other circuits in the aircraft, and no more electricity will be lost due to this short circuit. It does, however, mean that the consumers that only take power from that bus bar will be unable to receive power for the rest of the flight.",

External short circuit: Deformation of the battery cell causes an external short circuit. Overcharging the battery beyond the maximum voltage specified in the data sheet. Depending on the degree of overcharging, the battery may be damaged permanently and the service life of the battery decreases. Overheating/Excessive currents when charging.

Housing lithium-ion batteries in a vented metal casing can help to prevent them from becoming a fire hazard by reducing the risk of thermal runaway, which is a condition in which the battery temperature increases rapidly, potentially leading to ignition. The vented casing allows for dissipation of heat and venting of any flammable gases that may be generated during thermal runaway. The other options listed are not effective in preventing lithium-ion batteries from becoming a fire hazard. Installing a fuse on the positive pole of the battery does not address the root cause of thermal runaway, and may not provide adequate protection against ignition. Placing a halon fire extinguisher in the compartment with the battery is not a proactive measure to prevent thermal runaway and may not be able to effectively extinguish a fire that has already started. Continuously charging the battery during flight also does not prevent thermal runaway, and may actually increase the risk of thermal runaway if the battery is overcharged or damaged in some way.",

The armature is the spinning section of an electric motor. The field coils produce an magnetic field similar to that of a permanent magnet, only stronger, and able to be changed. The armature is the spinning coil(s) of wire that interact with that magnetic field to produce rotational movement. When the electric current in the armature increases, this increases the interaction with the magnetic field and increases torque. Therefore, the current is directly proportional to the torque produced. The magnetic field produced by the field coils also affects the torque. The stronger the magnetic field, the greater the interaction with the current flowing through the armature, so the greater the torque produced. Therefore, the magnetic field strength is also directly proportional to the torque produced. Both these statements are the same, no matter how the motor is wound (in series or in parallel).",

However, this rapid increase in speed poses a risk of motor damage. Instead of converting into shaft rotation, the surplus energy generates heat. As the mechanical load on the motor decreases, its speed increases, leading to a rise in back electromotive force (EMF). With a higher back EMF, the armature current decreases, thereby diminishing the torque applied to the motor. Torque, which represents the twisting force driving the motor, is measured in Newton-meters (Nm). It is influenced by the voltage, current, and magnetic fields within the motor. A decrease in current results in a reduction in the motor's torque output.",

They prevent the maximum power rating of a component to be exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High rupture capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it.",

In fact, modern computer components usually have very little variation between life expectancy at 80°C and at 30°C. Perhaps in older (a lot older) computers, this might be the case, but even then, I would be very sceptical that they would lose so much lifespan at such low temperatures unless 30°C is the maximum temperature for a particular component, where this could end up being true. That appears to be what EASA is saying though, a 10°C increase in temperature correlates to half the life expectancy. We have received this as feedback from an exam, so it is certainly one to remember and one to comment on in the exam, if possible.",

The basic idea of thermal runaway is that if the battery becomes too hot (usually during charging), its internal resistance will change, causing it to produce more heat, hence heating it up further, causing a positive feedback loop that ends in extreme overheating. Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. I would not refer to that as thermal runaway, but it is incredibly dangerous, and we don't think EASA knows the difference. Furthermore, damage can reduce a battery's charging capacity and circuitry that limits current flow, which can subsequently lead to overcharging/overheating, causing a true thermal runaway. The worst case scenario in a thermal runaway is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Ni-Cd fires are not as hot, but any fire is extremely bad, and these batteries are usually stored away from where people can contain the fires.",

Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0.

An amber FAULT light indicates an IDG oil outlet overheat or low oil pressure. When an IDG low oil pressure is detected, the pilot must operate the IDG disconnect push button. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When pushed, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reset on the ground by maintenance, after engine shutdown. IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers.",

They both use induction to make this happen, and therefore look very similar. This means that we can actually use one item to do both tasks, and just change whether we give it electrical energy, or rotational (kinetic) energy. We can actually use them for either piston or turbine engines, but most questions do ask about them in the context of turbine engines. They can be either AC or DC, with the smaller engines using mostly DC and larger engines (such as those on the B787) using AC. When the aircraft is being started, the starter-generator acts as an electrical \"starter\" motor, allowing the engine to get up to sufficient speed for it to have self-sustaining RPM (or idling in a piston engine). As soon as this is complete, the electricity input into the starter-generator is removed, and the generator (being still attached the spinning engine) is now generating electricity through the induction of the spinning coils, inducing current. It started the aircraft by doing the job of a motor, but then changed job, and is a generator for the rest of the flight.",

A small wire coil wound around a ferromagnetic core forms an electromagnet. When activated by a modest current, the electromagnet closes a switch with a hinged metallic arm that it pulls shut. When the current is switched off, the magnetic field disappears, and a spring forces the switch contacts to open. We are therefore using a very safe smaller circuit as a switch so we don't have to go anywhere near high current AC circuits, allowing them to be kept away from the flight deck, etc. The relay is physically separated (air gap/insulation) from the main circuit as otherwise the high current of the main circuit would fry the low rated relay circuit 1) The relay has physical separation from the circuit. - Correct As mentioned above. 3) The control can be fed with DC and the high current circuit can be fed with AC. - Correct The relay’s contacts are isolated from the control coil, enabling them to handle different types of currents. DC is required for the relay (control circuit) as it needs to keep the electromagnet on at a specific strength. AC or DC can be used by the main circuit, but AC is more common.",

            "explanation": "Paralleling generators is when two generators supply one bus bar. This allows the load to be shared between the two generators, and has the added advantage of maintaining power on the busbar in the event of one of the generators failing. When running the generators, it is necessary for each generator to provide half of the current required by the bas bar. In that scenario, they are load sharing. However to achieve load sharing the voltage output of both generators must be identical. If the voltage output of one generator was to exceed the other, then the current would flow towards the lower voltage generator. The scenario where the current flows from the generator with the higher voltage to the generator with the lower voltage output is known as recirculating current. In this case the higher voltage generator will be providing the current of the bus bar, and also the current demanded by the lower voltage generator. The reverse flow of the current to the generator will turn the lower voltage generator into a motor turning in the opposite direction of the rotation of the engine. Clearly this is a very undesirable situation therefore parallel systems have reverse current relays installs to prevent the reverse flow from occurring. Therefore the correct answer is that: In order for two generators to effectively load share in a parallel system, it is necessary to ensure that “their voltages are almost equal”. The other answers are incorrect because: “Equal loads are connected to each generator busbar before paralleling” Both generators supply the same busbar for there to be load sharing, therefore if they are supplying a load to the busbar they are already parallel. “Adequate voltage exists” As explained above, for there to be equal load sharing both generators must have the same voltage output, otherwise recirculating current will occur. Therefore this is incorrect. “The synchronizing bus-bar is disconnected from the busbar system” Each generator is first made to run at the correct voltage before closing its generator line contactor, therefore connecting to the busbar. This statement is therefore incorrect.",

Circuit breakers are circuit protection devices which can be \"reset\" if they trip (rather than a fuse which melts). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the thermal and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic (thermal) CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high for too long, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit, exactly like operating a switch. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, which is good for some systems but not for others. The higher the overcurrent, the faster the thermal CB will trip. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch (solenoid) to trip the breaker almost instantly. Obviously, it cannot be absolutely instant, as things take time to move and therefore a very short overcurrent will still be experienced by the circuit, so we have said that \"trips almost immediately\" is correct.",

            "explanation": "NOTE: This question is quite similar to Q215915. This question is quite narrow minded, as many different types of circuit breaker exist, some of which are designed to handle transient load spikes, etc. We using best judgement here and knowledge of other similar exam questions to answer this one. Please let us know if you see either question in the exam so we can verify them, thank you! When switching on an electric motor, there is an initial inrush current that is several times the motor's full load current. This is due to the high initial torque required to overcome the motor's inertia and start the rotation. This inrush current can cause a transient overcurrent that may exceed the rated current of the circuit breaker. Their circuit breakers are often built to handle these very short term overcurrents, but would trip if the overcurrent was sustained. Other heavy electrical consumers such as heating elements, ignition boxes, and strobe lights (intermittent loads) do not have the same inrush current as electric motors, and their startup transient spikes are not as severe. In that case, they may be fitted with circuit breakers with less ability to handle transient loads. Therefore, the design and rating of circuit breakers depend on various factors such as the type of load, application, and any other specific requirements. Therefore, the selection of the appropriate circuit breaker must consider the nature of the load and the operating conditions to ensure proper protection and reliable operation.",

            "explanation": "A Ram Air Turbine (RAT) is a small wind turbine that is installed in an aircraft to be used as a source of power during emergencies. In these cases, the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. The RAT generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump. Consequently, more power is generated when the aircraft is operating at a higher speed and less is generated when operating at lower speeds. For this question we have based our explanation off the Airbus A320, as is often the reference aircraft for EASA (sometimes they also use the B737 as a reference, but it does not have a RAT). The A320 has 3 main AC generators (one per engine and one for the APU), but if all of these fail (whilst airborne), then the RAT will deploy, and once spun up, it will pressurise the blue hydraulic system using a hydraulic pump. This system then drives a hydraulic motor which spins up the emergency AC generator. The emergency AC generator provides power to the AC ESS and (via the ESS TR unit) the DC ESS bus bars, in other words, essential AC and DC services. Therefore, essential AC services is the most correct answer here. As a side note, if this were to fail also, then the batteries would then be used to feed the DC essential services and (via a static inverter) the AC essential services, but would have a limited duration, of course. The AC emergency bus is not the correct answer as often this is not the name of such a bus bar and also, it also doesn't actually describe what services are being fed.",

            "explanation": "Inside an electrical motor, when the rotor seizes, it is a similar process to putting a very large load on the motor. If this occurs, then all of a sudden, the motor is not cutting any lines of flux (moving through the magnetic field), which means that the \"back EMF\" is removed completely. This back EMF is effectively the force which acts against the electricity in a motor, reducing the electrical energy due to it being turned into kinetic energy inside the motor. (Lenz's Law) If this back EMF (resistive force) is removed, that means that for the same voltage, the current can flow much more easily, so the current will increase through the armature, sometimes by a very large amount. This can be enough to melt fuses or wires in some motors. With an increased current, the available force from the motor per turn (which are no longer occuring) will also increase, and this is known as the torque. The seizure therefore creates higher torque, similar to when a motor is intially started up. We then have to consider what happens to the current within the stator, known as the field coils, which produce the magnetic field that the rotor turns within. The current through the stator will also increase when the rotor seizes, so would have a more powerful magnetic field. This helps towards the higher torque. (This question assumes that series windings are used, it being the most common in DC motors by far). Note: The feedback on this question is not perfect.

High current, often caused by these abusive conditions, exacerbates thermal runaway by increasing the rate of temperature rise within the battery. As the temperature climbs, it can trigger a chain reaction within the battery cells, leading to the release of more energy and generating even higher temperatures.

The APU will electrically supply the aircraft and other associated systems on the ground when the engines are not running, and the Ground Power unit (GPU) is not connected. As to why nowadays commercial aircraft generators are integrated with a CSD in an IDGU (integrated drive generator unit) and use mainly 400 Hz AC is because a higher frequency allows the manufacturers to make smaller and lighter generators that would allow increasing the payload instead of carrying extra weight from the generators. Because the frequency of an AC generator mainly relies on the number of pairs of poles and the speed of the rotor, it is sufficient to increase the generator’s rotational speed in order to provide a higher frequency, and thus decrease the generator’s size appropriately.",

One of the biggest threats to Ni-Cd (Nickel Cadmium) and Lithium Ion Batteries is the risk of thermal runaway. The basic idea of thermal runaway is that if the battery becomes too hot (usually during charging), its internal resistance will change, causing it to produce more heat, hence heating it up further, causing a positive feedback loop that ends in extreme overheating. Lithium Ion batteries are more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. The worst case scenario is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Ni-Cd fires are not as hot, but any fire is extremely bad, and these batteries are usually stored away from where people can contain the fires. Electrical failure could happen also, as the battery will become unusable as part of this process, and it could do significant damage to the electrical system eventually, but that is still not nearly as bad as any sort of fire.",

Please let us know if you get this question in the real exam, and differences you can remember, and if you know what the correct answer was, thank you! Learning Objectives 021.09.03.00 Generation. Remark: For standardisation purposes, the following standard expressions are used: DC generator: produces DC output; DC alternator: produces AC, rectified by integrated rectifying unit, the output is DC; DC alternator: producing a DC output by using a rectifier; AC generator: produces AC output; Starter generator: integrated combination of a generator and a starter motor; Permanent magnet alternator/ generator: self-exciting AC generator. You can read the full explanation of a brushless AC alternator/generator below, but specific to this question, the rotating field coils for the main generator get their DC current from another generator on the same shaft, which is then rectified from AC to DC by a spinning rectifier on that shaft (EASA would refer to this arrangement as a DC alternator, not a DC generator). The exciter generator gets its (DC) magnetic field from the voltage regulator, which usually receives its electricity from the final 3 phase output of the whole system, but initially gets its energy from a permanent magnet generator, with the magnets mounted on the same shaft, and producing unregulated voltage output just to start the system going. The system is completely brushless, which means that the only method of transferring electricity from a spinning component to a rotating component is without physical contact, so no brushes, slip rings, carbon contacts, etc. That removes 2 answers immediately. For the other two possible options: Permanent Magnet Generator: This answer is the most recent feedback, and is partially correct, but is usually just used for the initial excitation current. Smaller DC generator on the end of the alternator: This could also be correct, particularly if it said DC alternator, as that is effectively what the exciter and bridge rectifier are acting as. Brushless AC Alternators (PMG Type) Modern aircraft AC generators are predominantly self-exciting brushless alternators, and often incorporate a permanent magnet generator. To explain this, we are going to work backwards, from what we want our final output to be, to how we get every component of that to work. A generator is made up of a magnetic field (either produced by permanent magnets or by an electric \"field\" coil which acts like a magnet) and an armature coil. One of those is spinning (rotor) and the other is stationary (stator), and which is which is decided by the input and outputs required. The armature is where AC power is generated, from the rotational energy inputted by the spinning shaft (often from an engine via constant speed drive). The basis of an AC alternator/generator (for AC output they mean the same thing) is that we wish to have the output armature windings on the stator of the main generator, so we can send the AC power straight to the bus bars. This means that the field windings on the main generator must be mounter to the rotor. This main generator is where we make the power to output to the aircraft distribution system. The voltage of the main generator is regulated by changing the strength of the magnetic field, which just means changing the voltage through the field coil. So we somehow need a way to feed voltage-regulated DC power to a spinning coil rotating at 400 Hz. We do this by having a second generator, the exciter generator, mounted on the same shaft, with the rotor this time being the armature coils (and the stator is therefore the magnetic field producer). The spinning armatures generate 3 phase AC current which is sent through a spinning rectifier to produce the field coil for the main generator. The magnetic field for the exciter generator is provided by a DC supply from the voltage regulator. If the voltage output of the main generator drops, the voltage regulator increases the voltage to the exciter field coil, and the voltage of the main generator field will increase, increasing the final output voltage. Initial excitement can be provided by a permanent magnet generator, a third generator on the same shaft, this time with a permanent magnet (field) mounted on the rotor, and the armature (stator) picking up an AC supply, then rectifying it and using it to power the exciter field or the voltage regulator, etc. When the shaft begins spinning, this will be the first thing to produce any current.",

Temperature affected: the discharge rate of a lead-acid battery decreases with a decrease in temperature and vice versa. This is because the internal resistance increases at lower temperatures.

Very low change in voltage during discharge remains relatively the same around 1.2 volts. Low internal resistance Low maintenance Reliable Wide operating temperatures Thermal runaway: the heat generated in certain is more than what the batterie can dissipate, leading to a rapid increase in temperature. This lower temperature leads to a lower internal resistance causing an increase in charging current, therefore multiplying the effect even more. If not monitored, the battery may be completely destroyed during charging.

Split bus systems have a left AC bus and a right AC bus, and are fed solely by the single engine generator on that side. There is no connection between the two buses (in normal operation) as that would require the generators to be \"paralleled\" to each other, which means extra complexity. Parallel bus systems, on the other hand, are more useful when 3 or 4 engined aircraft are used, as each generator has its own AC bus bar to feed the aircraft electrical loads, but the generators are all paralleled to each other and there is a synchronising bus bar connecting all of the individual circuits. This is more useful for load sharing in the event of a generator failure, and general load sharing for unbalanced systems, meaning each generator produces the same load under normal operation. It does mean that some or all generators do have to be paralleled though, which is a bit of added complexity, matching their frequency, voltage and phase. That complexity is removed in the split bus system. Having a 4 engine-generator aircraft with a split bus system is still perfectly doable, but there are a few different ways it can be implemented, in terms of which bus bars get tied together in the event of a failure. \"Each pair of generators is connected to a common AC bus.\" This would require two generators to be paralleled on each side, which is sometimes called a partial parallel system (I believe the 747 has this), and is not a split bus system \"All 4 generators are connected to a common AC bus.\" This is a completely parallel bus system, not split bus. \"The AC buses are connected with bus-tie breakers.\" This is what happens in a split-bus system when a failure occurs, the failed generator is isolated from its bus bar, and the bus bar is then connected to a neighbouring bus bar to use it's electricity. This is not the case in normal operation. \"Each generator is connected to its own dedicated AC bus bar.\" Yes, as mentioned above, in the split bus system, each generator solely feeds its own AC bus bar in normal operation (maybe two if there is a generator failure somewhere else).",

Especially important is if in a FADEC controlled aircraft with no backup manual controls, such as a DA42, the engines will fail when the emergency batteries run out, and power is gone completely.

In this scenario, the pilot should promptly shut down the engine if either the starter motor warning light remains on or if the oil pressure fails to rise immediately after startup. Waiting for 30 seconds is quite a long time for the light to extinguish, according to standard procedures. \"The starter warning light is illuminated when the starter motor clutch is engaged\": Starters and starter-generator units often feature a warning light indicating when the starter motor clutch fails to disengage properly, indicating that the clutch remains engaged.

Therefore, they convert Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC) and also transform a certain voltage into another voltage. First, the transformation of voltage occurs whilst the current is in its AC state, then the unit gets to work turning the alternating current (which travels backwards and forwards within the circuit), into direct current which only flows one way. One problem then appears after this rectification stage as the output is now all in one direction, but is fluctuating. This fluctuation makes the direct current unusable. To make it a constant current, a filter, or smoothing circuit is used just before the output of the rectifier. This current should be made to remain the same, regardless of the load applied.

            "explanation": "Circuit breakers are circuit protection devices which can be \"reset\" if they trip (rather than a fuse which melts). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the thermal and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic (thermal) CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high for too long, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, which is good for some systems but not for others. The higher the overcurrent, the faster the thermal CB will trip. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch (solenoid) to trip the breaker almost instantly. Obviously, it cannot be absolutely instant, as things take time to move and therefore a very short overcurrent will still be experienced by the circuit, so we have said that \"trips almost immediately\" is correct. Note that we still require further feedback to confirm how the question was laid out, and what correct answer the examiner has chosen (the use of \"almost immediately\" is not exact and they could take a different view), thank you.",

Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. This is called an internal short circuit. It can cause a chain reaction (increased heat - increased resistance - increased heat, etc) and is incredibly dangerous. Furthermore, a lower amount of damage can reduce a battery's charging capacity and circuitry that limits current flow, which can subsequently lead to overcharging/overheating, causing a thermal runaway during charging. The worst case scenario with a damaged battery is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot, in the thousands of degrees Celsius.",

The other answer that we have feedback for is B: \"the busbar will be switched to another busbar\", which has a bad wording, but could be referring to \"connecting\" the two busbars together. Most modern aircraft with a twin engine design use a split bus system (rather than a parallel bus system), which differ in their distribution slightly. Split bus systems have a left AC bus and a right AC bus, and are fed solely by the engine generator on that side. There is no connection between the two busses (in normal operation) as that would require the generators to be \"paralleled\" to each other, which means extra complexity. This means that, if one generator fails, say the right generator for example, the right AC bus bar (and the right DC bus bar in most systems) would have no available power. This is when the generator circuit breaker (GCB) for the right generator would open, isolating the failed generator, and the bus tie breakers (BTBs) between the left and right AC busses would close, allowing the right AC bus to be fed from the left generator, via the left AC bus. This is just \"connecting\" the bus bars together. So far, this has all happened automatically, and the scenario is now stable, so the pilots can run checklists and decide what to do next. The left generator will be working hard at this point to feed all the onboard electricity, so the pilots would decide to start the APU (if it is available), and the right AC bus would likely be fed directly by the APU, and one of the BTBs opened to isolate the two AC busses from each other again.",

            "explanation": "Fuses and circuit breakers aim to protect every electrical circuit. They prevent the maximum power rating of a component or wire from being exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High Rupture Capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it. We can now go through the options: \"Upon reaching its nominal amperage, the fuse instantly melts.\" Incorrect. A fuse's \"nominal amperage\" is an amperage that it is able to handle continuously with no problem, as nominal operations are completely expected. \"Upon reaching its rated amperage, the fuse instantly melts.\" Incorrect. The rated amperage of a fuse is the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. Therefore, it should not melt at this amperage. \"The fuse must be as close as possible to the source to protect against short circuits.\" Correct. Whilst it may stray from the learning objectives a little, this option is correct as fuses are made to protect circuits from overcurrent, and therefore we wish to protect as much as possible of each circuit from overcurrent, particularly in the event of a short circuit, as they can happen anywhere on a wire or in a component and fry the source, wires or other components in the circuit. \"The fuse provides protection against voltage exceedances.\" Incorrect. Fuses protect from overcurrent, not voltage exceedances.",

            "explanation": "A differential fault exists when there is a difference between the generator output current and the bus bar input current, which suggests that there is an earth fault between the two. The generator is essentially the powerhouse that creates electricity. This electricity is then channeled to a busbar, which acts like a central hub connecting different electrical circuits. Think of the busbar as a meeting point where electricity from the generator is distributed to various parts of a system. When there's a big difference in the electrical characteristics (like current, voltage, or frequency) between the generator and the busbar, it's a sign that something might be wrong. This difference can indicate issues within the generator itself or in the wiring that connects it to the busbar. A differential fault specifically refers to this significant mismatch. It's a critical issue because it can lead to malfunctions or damage in the electrical system. To detect these faults, a special device called a differential relay is used. This relay constantly monitors the balance between the generator and the busbar. When it detects a large discrepancy, it triggers protective measures to prevent further damage or system failure.",

Learning Objective 021.09.04.03.02: Describe the following distribution consequences: power transfer between different power supplies; power transfer in the event of a supply failure; loss of all normal AC supplies. The two primary methods of distributing AC power in an aircraft are via the split bus and parallel bus systems. Split bus systems have each generator feeding its own load bus, which are not usually connected at all. They run independently of each other, and usually have a TRU (Transformer Rectifier Unit) each to provide DC electrical power. Parallel bus systems are naturally \"paralleled\" when possible, and have a synchronising bus (or sometimes 2) which means that many generators are all putting power into all the load busses. This system is most commonly used on aircraft with more than 2 engines, for simplicity. In the event of a generator failure in a split bus system, the generator is cut off from its load bus and the BTB (Bus Tie Breaker) is closed to allow the working generator to feed both load busses. The APU can then be used to take over the failed generator and return the system back to normal if it is available. As this happens after generator cut-off, there is no need to parallel the supplies in normal service. In a parallel bus system, a generator failure means that the failed generator will be cut off from the rest of the system, and the load busses will all be fed from the remaining generators that are already connected to it, so essentially the bus tie breaker is already closed, and the generator just needs to be disconnected via the GCB (Generator Circuit Breaker). The batteries provide DC power, which can be put through an inverter to feed the essential AC bus, but this would only occur in the event of a multiple generator failure, where the batteries are the only remaining power source.",

Direct current is the simplest to consider, charge flows from high potential to low potential (conventional) through electrical conductors continuously, all in the same direction. Alternating current is a little more complex, where the charge flows backwards and forwards through an electrical conductor, with the current increasing in one direction, then in the opposite direction, and so on. The majority of light aircraft simply use a DC electrical system (often 14 V or 28 V), as this is usually the simplest to generate and distribute through a simple aircraft with few consumers. Larger aircraft use AC systems (often 3 phase, 115 V, 400 Hz) as they require increased power generation and have consumers require high loads. They also have some loads onboard that require DC power, so have this capability also. Electricity can be transferred between the two different types (AC and DC) by the use of rectifiers and inverters. AC is \"rectified\" to turn it into DC (think of it that AC is too complex, and it has to be fixed [\"rectified\"] to turn it into simple direct current). In aircraft, we do not want to turn 115 V AC straight into DC, it would be far too much for the 28 V circuits, so first a transformer is used to bring the voltage down to 28 V, and then it is rectified. Aircraft use an integrated Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) for these job, to go from high voltage AC to lower voltage DC. DC can be \"inverted\" into alternating current, and this is quite intuitive, as AC is just DC, flipped backwards and forwards many times per second, and then smoothed into a sine wave. Aircraft will often have an inverter on board, for operations where the aircraft needs to use a DC power source like batteries to power it's AC consumers. As with the rectification process, the low voltage DC will create low voltage AC, which will need to go through a step-up transformer to reach the usual 115 V AC required.",

Nonetheless, if you do see this in the exam, you can still answer correctly of course. A capacitor is a form of short-term electrical storage device, which stores a small amount charge on one side of the capacitor, which can be rapidly gained or lost. They are used in disposable cameras to produce the flash (they have thousands of other uses, but this is one of the most easily understood). In an AC circuit, though, capacitors cause the current to shift in relation to the voltage. The current leads the voltage, by up to 90º phase difference. There is a mechanic that drives this, but we do not need to know it (we actually should not need to know any of this on the current syllabus). The difference between voltage and current causes a reduction in power called capacitive reactance, which causes inefficiency in the circuit. The effect of capacitive reactance reduces at higher frequencies (the alternating current alternates more times per second), and this allows the current to increase at these higher frequencies. theoretically, at infinite frequency, the capacitive reactance would have no effect, and the AC circuit would act as if no capacitor were present at all. Therefore, an increase in frequency causes an increase in current for the same voltage.",

For the ATPLs, as per the learning objective above, the examiner is talking about alternating current (AC), which has a varying voltage and current across it, going from maximum in one direction, to maximum in the other direction, many times per second. This looks like a sine wave, and can be measured in \"cycles\", with one cycle being from peak to peak, or from trough to trough. Frequency is the measure of how many cycles occur per unit of time. The SI (French - Système International - International system of units) for frequency is Hertz (Hz), which is \"cycles per second\". (Because \"cycles\" is a number without a unit, the derivation of Hertz from base units is actually just \"per second\", or s-1).",

Static wicks dissipate precipitation static that can develop as you fly through areas of uncharged particles. These particles can exist as you fly through solid or liquid particles such as rain, snow, fog, dust or ash. As the airplane flies through the particles, positive charges deflect and negative charges attach to the airframe, building up and eventually discharging at certain points of the airframe where the static wicks are generally attached.

The main function of this system is to maintain a constant frequency, sometimes referred to as speed. In other words, it is a hydromechanical unit that turns the physical motion of oil/fluid into an AC or DC current. The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swashplate. The angle of the swash plate will either limit or increase the oil flow towards the hydraulic and in turn affect the rpm of the engine. The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turn is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator. The CSD can be disconnected from the engine drive shaft at any time during the flight. However, only the engineers can reconnect the CSD, on the ground, with the engines off.",

Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. The worst case scenario in a thermal runaway is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Almost all lithium ion batteries are made up of separate cells packed next to each other, with a battery controller linking the cells together and providing balanced charging, discharge, etc. Any fire from one cell (which burns incredibly hot as we have mentioned) will almost certainly spread to the other cells, and there is no way that most battery cases are able to contain that fire, as they burn in the region of thousands of degrees.",

These units are used in situations where AC distribution system needs to supply a DC system. The other answers are incorrect: “Rectifiers and voltage reducing resistors” – Even though rectifiers are commonly used to convert AC to DC, using resistors to lower the voltage have many disadvantages. Firstly, resistors dissipate power as heat, therefore the system will lose energy to lower the voltage, this is something that transformers typically do not. Secondly, the voltage drop of a resistor is dependent on the load, therefore cause fluctuations in voltage. This is something that doesn’t typically happen with transformers. “AC-DC Regulators” – Regulators work very similarly to resistors, hence they lose energy by turning it into heat. Therefore they are much less efficient than transformers. “Portable batteries” – Even though portable batteries would be able to power the DC power, and it is required that batteries can power the main system in case of an emergency, they would not be able to power the aircraft for the entire flight. Therefore DC batteries would never entirely power the DC system unless in an emergency.",

This back EMF is effectively the force which acts against the electricity in a motor, reducing the electrical current due to the energy being turned into kinetic energy. (Lenz's Law) The back EMF acts against the armature coil, which is the set of spinning coils in the centre of the motor. If this back EMF (resistive force) is reduced, that means that for the same voltage, the current can flow more easily, so the current will increase. With an increased current, the available force from the motor per turn will also increase, and this is known as the torque. Therefore, to summarise, increasing the load on a DC motor decreases the spin speed, which decreases the electrical resistance (back EMF), thereby increasing the current, which increases the torque.",

If the system is degraded down to battery power only, where load shedding is essential to save battery power to get you on the ground safely. If the system is under very high load, and the operating power sources may not be enough to power everything. This likely means a bad system design, but this is what we think the correct answer is talking about. Therefore, non-essential loads are shed to reduce overall system load or save battery. This may be automatic or manual, and some aircraft have a \"shed bus\" or multiple of them, which automatically stop being powered when a generator fails, or the load becomes too high, etc. Manual load shedding can be done by removing systems such as IFE (in-flight entertainment) or galley power, which are the first systems to go.",

It works in the opposite sense to a motor, and turns the rotation into electrical energy. It requires the field coils to produce a magnetic field, which is then spinning (due to the rotation) and inducing a voltage on the fixed armature coils around the edge of the motor. The frequency of the AC output is governed by the constant speed drive, and the voltage is governed by the voltage regulator. The voltage (usually 115 V AC) is constantly produced by the generator, due to the voltage regulator modifying the amount of current that flows through the field coils. This voltage will change based on the electrical load applied within that circuit. If the electrical load increases, the current flow will increase, which will cause a drop in the voltage over the armature coils. You can think of this as the generator not being able to provide free extra power without making any changes. The voltage reduction is sensed by the voltage regulator, which then increases the excitation current through the field coils, increasing the strength of the magnetic field, and providing a higher output voltage to stabilise the change.",

They prevent the maximum power rating of a component or wire from being exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High rupture capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it.",

The APU will electrically supply the aircraft and other associated systems on the ground when the engines are not running, and the Ground Power unit (GPU) is not connected. As to why nowadays commercial aircraft generators are integrated with a CSD in an IDGU (integrated drive generator unit) and use mainly 400 Hz AC is because a higher frequency allows the manufacturers to make smaller and lighter generators that would allow increasing the payload instead of carrying extra weight from the generators. Because the frequency of an AC generator mainly relies on the number of pairs of poles and the speed of the rotor, it is sufficient to increase the generator’s rotational speed in order to provide a higher frequency, and thus decrease the generator’s size appropriately.",

(Lenz's Law) If this back EMF (resistive force) is reduced, that means that for the same voltage, the current can flow more easily, so the current will increase through the armature, sometimes by a very large amount. This can even be enough to melt fuses or wires in some motors. The higher current flow means that there is more power consumed (power = voltage x current), and also the motor will produce higher torque.",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOR gate – OR gate + NOT = inverted \"OR\" output, symbolized again by the small circle at the output of the OR gate along with the bar over the “C”.

AC (Alternating Current) electricity does not flow straight down the wires like DC does, it actually flows forwards and backwards, many times per second. In Europe, the mains electricity supply is AC, and the frequency of the AC is 50 Hz, meaning that the sine wave of voltage repeats 50 times per second (this is actually 100 \"flips\" per second, but we measure from peak to peak as 1 wave).

The static may build up unequally between aircraft parts and this could lead to sparks between the components. These sparks could lead to a fire. Therefore aircraft bonding between parts is installed to prevent the potential difference from being created between the parts, and therefore preventing any sparks from occurring. Bonding in itself is simply to connect all components of the aircraft with flexible wire strips, creating an easy path for electrons to pass between parts. On top of assuring a equal potential difference, the bonding system can also be used as a earth return system for a unipole circuit. Incorrect answers: “eliminate the need for grounding the aircraft during refuelling.” – The wires create a connection between the aircraft parts, but not to the ground. “prevent the aircraft being struck by lightning.” – Even though the grounding system will help the electrons from the lighting pass through the aircraft, it will not prevent the aircraft from being hit by a lightning strike. “ensure the electrical potential of the aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.” – The bonding system ensures that the potential difference between the components is zero, not that the entire aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.",

In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. We can now go through each option: \"A separate oil reservoir.\" Correct. A separate oil reservoir is part of a dry sump oil system. \"An oil filter with a bypass indicator.\" An oil filter will be in all types of engine oil system, due to the need to clean the oil and remove particulates before they are re-circulated through the engine. The bypass indicator shows clogging of the filter, and indicates when the filter is no longer being used, and the emergency bypass valve has opened to let oil past. \"An integrated oil reservoir.\" Wet sump oil systems use an integrated reservoir that stores the oil in the bottom of the engine casing. \"A pump to provide oil flow to the engine.\" Both types of oil system will include a pump to provide oil flow to the engine. In a wet sump system, it is the only oil pump. In a dry sump system, this is called the pressure pump (there is also a scavenge pump).",

            "explanation": "A turbocharger’s main task is to maintain power with increasing altitude as air density is decreasing, therefore making the power available less affected by altitude. The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than the exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

If the throttle is pulled back, the propeller pitch would automatically decrease (fine pitch) but the RPM will remain the same, and vice-versa. The governor controls a hydraulic servo system feeding high-pressure oil, via a pilot valve, to a piston in the pitch change mechanism (PCM). The CSU operates on the principle of balancing a spring pressure against the centrifugal force of rotating governor flyweights, driven directly from the engine or reduction gearbox. Usually, in a piston engine, the governor flyweights are tensioned by a speeder spring, which is controlled from the cockpit by setting the RPM lever. In a turboprop, however, the most efficient engine RPM is maintained by pre-tensioning the speeder spring to give the maximum engine RPM at all times.",

However, if the grounding wire is broken, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply. Caution! Maintenance action should be sought before touching the propeller since the engine can start at any time with one magneto still un-grounded.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.10.09.04.03: Describe the operating principle of a variable pitch propeller when feathering and unfeathering, including the operation of cockpit controls. When flying with a variable pitch propeller (the most common type being a \"constant speed propeller\"), there is often an extra lever in the cockpit near the throttles to control the propeller pitch. In the standard \"constant speed propeller\" systems, this extra lever (coloured blue) sets the speed of the engine (the RPM), and the black throttle lever then dictates how much fuel and air mixture is allowed into the cylinders, which sets the manifold pressure. Having a constant speed propeller (variable pitch), means that the engine/propeller can run at their best RPM all the time, whether that be at 0 kt at the beginning of the take off roll or at 150 kt in the cruise, for instance. The incoming airflow at 150 kt means that the propeller must be set much more coarse to still cut out the same sized \"chunks of air\", thereby maintaining the correct angle of attack with the airflow. Fine pitch is when the chord of the propeller is more inline with the plane of rotation, and is more efficient for low speed flying, take-off, go arounds, etc. Coarse pitch is used in the cruise. Going past the coarse pitch until the propeller is pointing directly forwards (near 90° blade angle) is called feathering. It is used to reduce drag when the engine stops. If the engine stops with the propeller in the normal operating range, the airflow actually tries to turn the engine, which is what we call windmilling. This is what we need for restarting the engine, but it is not good for drag. Therefore, to \"unfeather\" an engine (to try a restart), we need to move the blade angle from feathered to fine (best for windmilling), which will initially provide negative thrust (drag), but as soon as the engine is turning under its own power, will be able to produce forwards thrust, which is not possible when feathered. The way to remember whether to push or pull the blue prop lever is to think of a go around/take off. In these scenarios, we want all three levers forwards, throttle full, propeller fine, mixture rich. Therefore, this means that for the blue lever, forward is fine, so full back must be feathered. This means that to unfeather, we must push the lever forwards.",

The violence of detonation also causes a reduction in power. Mild detonation may increase engine wear, though some engines can operate with mild detonation. However, severe detonation can cause engine failure in minutes. Because of the noise that it makes, detonation is called \"engine knock\". Detonation and its resulting high heat is detrimental to piston engine operation. Its cumulative effects can lead to piston, ring, and cylinder head failure and place thermal stress on other operating components.

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.04: Describe the function and the principle of operation of the following main components of a turbocharger: turbine; compressor; waste gate; waste-gate actuator. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. Turbochargers (and any superchargers, really) increase the amount of air (and therefore fuel) we can ignite in the cylinders, and are measured by the MAP; the higher the MAP, the more air/fuel mixture we can burn in each power stroke. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for mixing with fuel and then entry into the cylinders (or sent straight into the cylinders where fuel injection takes place). All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use. The turbochargers we talk about are controlled by waste-gates, which are situated in the exhaust manifold, and decide how much exhaust gas to divert to the turbine; if the MAP is too low (for what has been asked for), then the waste-gate will send more air to the turbine to get a faster spinning compressor, and vice-versa. The movement of the waste-gate is powered by the oil pressure on the waste-gate actuator which is cleverly controlled by a system that measures the MAP and makes changes to the oil pressure accordingly, thereby moving the waste-gate actuator, and the waste-gate position. To go a little deeper, the waste-gate (as per its name) actually controls how much exhaust gas is allowed to bypass the turbine, and by closing the waste-gate and letting no gas escape would mean that all the gas would go through the turbine (to cause a high MAP) and vice versa (open waste-gate for slow turbine/compressor for lower MAP).",

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.05: Explain the difference between an altitude-boosted turbocharger and a ground-boosted turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same manifold pressure and power output up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. For this reason, most aircraft use altitude boosted turbochargers, not ground boosted turbochargers. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use. As for the other options: The power should not increase with altitude (in any meaningful way), it should either remain roughly the same or decrease above a certain altitude. The reducing temperature of the air increases air density so actually aids power output slightly. Again, the power output shouldn't increase with increasing altitude.",

To make it simple, the bigger the volumetric efficiency of a given engine, the bigger the power produced. Therefore, the simplest way to increase it, would be to increase the amount of mixture entering the cylinder, which is the exact purpose of the superchargers. Because in this question it is stated that the MAP is maintained CONSTANT, it means that the pressure, and therefore the density inside the engine is higher than in the outside air you’re currently flying in. Additionally, the decrease in temperature further increases the density of the air flowing through the engine. Moreover, in a simple piston engine without turbocharging, the volumetric efficiency only increases by increasing RPM (=increased momentum of the gases) and/or with increasing altitude where the drop in air density produces a drop in exhaust backpressure, which in turn will further increase the mass flow (and density) in the cylinder.",

The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce a minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

            "explanation": "Aircraft icing can be divided into two general types based on whether it affects power production or aerodynamics. Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the outside air temperature is between -10°C and +30°C and with a high relative humidity. Carburettor icing is particularly common, as the air cools down significantly inside the carburettor, not only due to the decreased static pressure in the venturi section (decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air. It is worse when the throttle is low, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect. As you can see by the graph above, the worst icing happens between about -1°C and +15°C, which shows that the second item is not correct. Fuel injection systems provide uniform and reliable fuel delivery, better icing protection, and quicker throttle response. They work on the principle of feeding fuel under pressure to the engine, therefore they don’t need a venturi in the air intake. Without any ducts that inevitably reduce the temperature by their nature, the fuel injection systems are less prone to air intake icing than the traditional carburetor fuel systems. However, icing still may occur due to precipitation that enters from the external environment and contaminates the ducts. Induction systems are prone to icing in the event of heavy precipitation during winter operations, as snow or freezing rain hitting the filters can block the induction system. The first item is not correct as well.",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

            "explanation": "The throttle controls the power output of the engine which is registered on the manifold pressure. The propeller control regulates the engine RPM and, in turn, the propeller RPM. - During take-off - when the forward motion of the airplane is at low speeds and when maximum power and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller sets up a low propeller angle (pitch). The low blade angle keeps the angle of attack, with respect to the relative wind small and efficient at the low speed. At the same time, it allows the propeller to \"slice it thin\" and handle a smaller mass of air per revolution. This light load allows the engine to turn at maximum rpm and develop maximum power. Although the mass of air per revolution is small, the number of revolutions per minute is high. - As the airspeed increases after lift-off, the load on the engine is lightened because of the small blade angle. The governor senses this and increases the blade angle slightly. Again => higher blade angle + higher speeds => keeps the angle of attack with respect to the relative wind small and efficient. - For climb (after take-off), the power output of the engine is reduced to climb power => by decreasing the manifold pressure (pretty straight forward) and lowering RPM by increasing the blade angle. (the angle of attack is kept small by increasing the blade angle with an increase in airspeed) - At cruising altitude, when the aeroplane is in level flight => less power is required to produce a higher airspeed than is used in climb. Consequently, engine power is again reduced by lowering the manifold pressure and increasing the blade angle (to decrease RPM). The higher airspeed and higher blade angle enable the propeller to handle a greater mass of air per second at still smaller slipstream velocity.",

This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. Each magneto is controlled by its own ignition switch. The switch isolates the magneto’s ignition circuit by connecting the circuit to Earth. In order to completely switch off the ignition system, the primary circuit needs to be grounded. In this condition, it is said to be ‘grounded’. However, if the grounding wire is broken, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. Note: If the primary circuit is grounded, it will automatically ground the secondary circuit as well.",

The 2 main types of propellers found in aviation reciprocating engines are the following: Fixed pitch propeller: which is the simplest type of propeller with no additional moving parts fitted to most light general aviation aircraft. The engine RPM, and so, the power generation is controlled by the throttle. The propeller’s pitch angle is fixed and designed to be efficient at the normal maximum cruising speed. Variable pitch propeller: designed to keep a set rpm throughout the entire flight range. The propeller controls the engine at this set rpm through a device called a Constant Speed Unit (CSU). Any variations in engine power output, which would normally produce a change in rpm, will be sensed by the CSU that will alter the propeller’s pitch angle to keep the rpm constant. To avoid an engine overboost the RPM will be increased before increasing the manifold pressure.",

The priming pump will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the inlet manifold. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs.",

It allows many hundreds of sensor inputs to be fed to the central computer, an EEC (electronic engine controller) or ECU (engine control unit), which then calculates the best outputs for performance and efficiency, and can automatically make such inputs. It has control over every available part of the engine, from fuel-air mixture to ignition timing and even the propeller controller for variable pitch propellers. Ignition timing is the point in the 4 stroke engine cycle where the air/fuel mixture is ignited, and as RPM increases, the ignition timing should get earlier in the cycle to provide the best efficiency. In a diesel engine, this is the point where the fuel is injected, as it immediately ignites. The advantages of FADEC on piston engines include: Reduced weight Optimum efficiency No possibility of exceeding engine limitations Easy engine diagnostics There are also disadvantages to FADEC, which include: High complexity 2 ECUs are required to avoid a single point of failure No ability to gain excess power out of the engine in a crisis (e.g. terrain escape) Complete electrical failure means an engine failure (or uncontrollable engines) This question is on the topic of piston engine FADEC, which is currently used in a few light aircraft, such as the DA40, DA42, etc., but FADEC has been used for many years on turbine engines, and modern turbine engines are almost exclusively FADEC these days.",

The biggest difference between the two is where the oil is stored when not in use. In a dry-sump system, the used oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the oil reservoir. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. For this question then, that means that a pressure pump is still required (to take the oil out of the sump and spray it into the correct engine locations) as well as the internal sump as it is both a sump and the oil reservoir, integrated into the engine block. The external sump and scavenge pump are therefore not required (they are dry sump items).",

            "explanation": "A piston engine operates using a cycle of induction, compression, combustion and exhaust. In the induction stroke, the fresh, unburnt air/fuel mixture enters the cylinder (is pulled in by the retreating piston). In the compression stroke, all valves are closed and the air/fuel mixture is compressed by the advancing piston. The combustion stroke is where the mixture is set alight by the spark plug, and the pressure generated by this combustion provides the power to push the piston downwards. The final stroke of a 4-stroke engine's \"Otto cycle\" is the exhaust stroke, where the piston advances one again and the burnt exhaust gasses are forced out through the exhaust valve. The combustion occurs at a higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, as the air/fuel mixture is compressed by the piston just before ignition. The amount of compression is known as the compression ratio (around 10:1 for petrol engines and around 20:1 for diesel engines), and this is a very important figure that dictates the combustion that occurs in the cylinder. The amount of fuel/air misture that is burnt in each cylinder can be increased also by various types of supercharger, which further increase the pressure above the atmospheric pressure, thereby increasing the power transfer of the combustion. Let's go through the options: \"Spark plug temperature and oil viscosity.\" Spark plugs provide a spark using an electrical arc, which by its very nature is hot enough to ignite the air fuel mixture. Oil should not be part of the combustion (and if it is, that is quite bad), so its viscosity isn't important to the combustion. \"Atmospheric pressure and carburettor compression.\" The atmospheric pressure affects the combustion, yes, but the carburettor simply mixes air and fuel and meters a certain amount of it to the engine, it doesn't compress anything. \"Atmospheric pressure and pressure within the cylinder.\" This is correct, as explained above, these pressures massively affect the combustion within the engine. \"Fuel viscosity and exhaust gas temperature.\" Fuel should be vapourised by this point so viscosity makes little difference. Exhaust gas temperature is an output, and doesn't affect the input or the pressures themselves.",

            "explanation": "Besides being one of the most relevant indicators to monitor the engine’s proper operation, the EGT also assists the pilot in adjusting the correct mixture. Let’s assume you have just arrived at your planned cruising level and you’re ready to lean your engine. Because you were climbing, your mixture was full rich, which was providing extra cooling to the cylinders. Now that you reached a higher level where the air density is much lower, you need to lean the mixture in order to achieve the perfect fuel/air ratio and achieve a better engine performance. You will therefore start to pull back (lean) the mixture control lever (red). Because you started to deliver less fuel to the cylinders, they will receive less cooling and the EGT will start to rise. The maximum EGT of a piston engine is theoretically associated with a fuel (mass) to air ratio of 1:15. As you will continue leaning, you will start noticing some roughness in the engine’s operation: the engine has been starved of fuel just enough to produce peak power, so the RPM will start dropping. Since the power produced is not enough, the EGT will also start to drop. If the mixture is enriched again by advancing the red lever, the power will surge again, and you will see an increase in RPM and you will reach an EGT that is lower to the peak you’ve found in step (2) and corresponds to the best power production mixture. It will also provide you a small surplus of fuel for cooling and safety buffer.",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than the exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

In terms of the other options, pressurisation and landing gear are not controlled by the FADEC engines, and whilst FADEC does take over the control of the fuel injectors for the most part, that was already a control that was available to the pilots before FADEC (a type of throttle), whereas ignition timing could not be controlled in flight before the invention of FADEC and ECUs.

The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at a much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from a higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow.

As the intake valve is open, it allows the air/fuel mixture in the intake manifold to flow into the cylinder. Normally aspirated engines do not have any superchargers fitted. A supercharger is a device after the air intake (but before the carburettor) that compresses the intake air, increasing the manifold air pressure to allow an increased density of fuel/air mixture to enter the cylinders. It is particularly important for aircraft as they fly at high altitudes where the air density is low, causing a low engine power, as there is less air/fuel to burn. A turbocharger is a special type of supercharger that uses exhaust gas to power the compressor. To answer this question then, the force which causes the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinders in a normally aspirated engine is simply the pressure difference between ambient pressure (manifold pressure) and the pressure in the cylinder, which is decreasing throughout the intake stroke. At altitude, the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level, so there is less of a pressure differential, and lower mass flow into the cylinder, but the system of air intake is the same.",

A dry sump engine is one where the oil is not allowed to sit in the engine sump for too long, and is instead \"scavenged\" back to a separate reservoir. This is the opposite of a \"wet sump\" engine, where the sump (within the engine casing) is the reservoir, and a lot less systems are required, but with reduced engine power due to energy losses, and inability to perform many aerobatic manoeuvres. With a dry sump engine, the oil enters from the \"external\" reservoir, where it is stored when not at work in the engine, via a pressure pump, getting it up to a suitable pressure to spray inside the engine. The oil then lubricates, cools and cleans the engine components, finally ending up at the bottom of the engine, where it gathers in the sump, and is collected up by a scavenge pump, which returns it to the reservoir. The oil is often quite aerated and foamy by this point, so is less dense, and the scavenge pump needs a larger volume to cope with this oil, and not let it mount up in the sump. In comparison to the wet sump system, dry sump oil systems have: Better control of cooling, as the oil does not have to stay sat in the bottom of the hot engine; The ability to perform aerobatics and keep the engine correctly oiled; Less oil oxidation and contamination; Higher capacity for oil, as it limited by the external reservoir, which can be made larger than the engine sump.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.10: Explain the purpose of a supercharger and the basic differences from a turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. In reality, a turbocharger is a particular type of supercharger. All superchargers compress the fresh intake air so more fuel/air mixture can be burnt in each power stroke, thereby making the engine more powerful (or allowing it to maintain its power to higher altitudes). Supercharger is technically the umbrella term that covers all such devices, but in reality, most people refer to power augmentation devices as follows. Supercharger: An engine driven compressor which allows an increase in MAP. Turbocharger: A device where the excess heat and speed of the exhaust gasses drive a turbine which drives the compressor, allowing for increased MAP. There are various reasons for using each; superchargers do not suffer from turbo-lag, but do take power directly away from the crankshaft, whereas turbochargers are more efficient by taking energy away from the otherwise wasted exhaust gasses. In aircraft, turbochargers are far more widely used, but the learning objectives do ask us to understand the key differences between the two. Turbochargers do cause a small power loss that is not often talked about, and that is due to exhaust back pressure. Essentially, in an non-turbocharged engine, the exhaust gasses are allowed to flow freely from the cylinders during the exhaust stroke, but when a turbocharger is added (and the waste-gate is closed, meaning that all air goes through the turbine), there is some back pressure from the more restrictive flow through the turbine. This means that exhaust gasses are not removed as effectively, and the engine does lose out on a small amount of power. It is not a lot though, as the extra MAP means that the power increases massively for this small loss. On normally aspirated and supercharged (not turbo-) engines, though, the exhaust gasses are allowed to leave the engine without restriction, and technically, the higher we fly, the lower the ambient pressure, so the lower the exhaust back pressure. This is a very small gain of course, but it can make a difference, especially when a supercharger makes the engine perform like it is at a low altitude, but with even better exhaust gas removal.",

This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. In order to break the gap between the sparking plug electrodes, the magnetos consist of a rotating permanent magnet surrounded by a U-shaped stator of soft iron, around which a thick primary and a thin secondary winding can be found. The thick winding (primary) is the low-tension element of the circuit and consists only of a few turns of thick wire. Whereas the thin winding (secondary) is the high-tension element of the circuit consisting of numerous thin windings that act as a step-up transformer. As a consequence of this arrangement, any electrical current in the primary circuit (thick winding) will induce a higher voltage in the secondary winding. Both windings will be supplied with alternating current from the permanent set of magnetos as they’re driven by the engine. Another important aspect you need to understand in the principle of magnetos operation is that the primary winding will be continuously broken and then restored by a contact breaker. The contact will be broken by a permanently rotating breaker cam which main task is to break the primary circuit. The reason why we need the primary circuit to get broken is because this will create a collapse in the primary’s winding magnetic field that will produce an increase in energy in the secondary winding. The second reason is that the normal AC produced in the primary winding will be converted into a series of pulses. The general outcome of this sequence of actions will result in a series of very high voltage, low current pulses of electricity that will be fed to a distributor. Distributor’s task will be then to spread these pulses through a high-tension leads to the spark-plugs.",

Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. The more air (and therefore fuel/air mixture) we can get into each cylinder, the more intense the flame, producing a much stronger power stroke. A turbocharger (or any supercharger, really) would run a compressor to increase the pressure of the fresh intake air, so more fuel/air mixture can enter the cylinders and provide more power during each power stroke. When an engine does not have one of these, it is referred to as being \"normally aspirated\", or \"naturally aspirated\". This means that the MAP will only ever be as high as the ambient pressure outside, and the mass flow (and power) through the engine depends completely on the density of the ambient air. The higher the aircraft flies, the lower the air density becomes, which means that the lower mass flow through a normally aspirated engine will produce less power. This is the same in hot conditions and also in high atmospheric humidity, where air density is low, and maximum power output is therefore reduced.",

            "explanation": "A magneto is a self-contained, engine-driven electrical generator designed to supply a high voltage to the sparking plugs. This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. In order to break the gap between the sparking plug electrodes, the magnetos consist of a rotating permanent magnet surrounded by a U-shaped stator of soft iron, around which a thick primary and a thin secondary winding can be found. The thick winding (primary) is the low-tension element of the circuit and consists only of a few turns of thick wire. Whereas the thin winding (secondary) is the high-tension element of the circuit consisting of numerous thin windings that act as a step-up transformer. As a consequence of this arrangement, any electrical current in the primary circuit (thick winding) will induce a higher voltage in the secondary winding. Both windings will be supplied with alternating current from the permanent set of magnetos as they’re driven by the engine. Another important aspect you need to understand in the principle of magnetos operation is that the primary winding will be continuously broken and then restored by a contact breaker. The contact will be broken by a permanently rotating breaker cam which main task is to break the primary circuit. The reason why we need the primary circuit to get broken is that this will create a collapse in the primary’s winding magnetic field that will produce an increase in energy in the secondary winding. The second reason is that the normal AC produced in the primary winding will be converted into a series of pulses. The general outcome of this sequence of actions will result in a series of very high voltage, low current pulses of electricity that will be fed to a distributor. The distributor’s task will be then to spread these pulses through a high-tension leads to the spark plugs.",

Oil pressure is a very important indication to monitor during engine start and in-flight. High oil pressure may indicate a blockage in the system, whereas a low oil pressure would likely indicate a loss of oil through oil leak or damage, but may also indicate a pump failure. Oil temperature (another very important indication to monitor as a pilot) actually affects oil pressure quite a lot. On a cold morning, you will often find that the oil pressure rises higher than normal during engine start, and may stay that way for a couple of minutes whilst the oil warms up. This is because the oil starts at a temperature much colder than its usual operating temperature, and is much more viscous when cold (leading to slower fluid flow and higher pressure buildup). For this reason, some engines use thinner oils in winter to counteract the colder oil temperatures and avoid oil overpressure. As for the other options, high oil temperature is obviously the opposite of the correct answer, an oil leak would cause a small reduction, and eventual loss of oil pressure completely. Cowl flaps are more interesting: They are fitted to some aeroplanes to change how much airflow is available to cool the engine. With them closed, there is less airflow to cool the oil, so the oil will be warmer, and will not give a higher oil pressure indication.",

When the pilot reaches the top of climb (especially when climbing at Max Continuous Power), they must reduce their power output and set the aircraft up for the cruise. This is usually done by bringing backwards both throttle and RPM levers (and sometimes the mixture lever also). Pilots who fly aircraft fitted with constant speed (variable pitch) propellers, will choose a power setting to fly at, which includes an RPM setting and a manifold pressure setting. When retarding the thrust from climb to cruise, the pilot will first reduce the MAP (manifold absolute pressure) by retarding the throttle, then reducing the RPM lever to the cruise setting after this (usually less than the climb RPM, primarily for the reason of better fuel economy at lower RPMs), then re-adjust the MAP if necessary. This order of operations avoids an overboost scenario. The answer to this question is therefore a decrease of both the MAP and RPM, and the RPM is decreased by increasing the blade angle of the propeller. The RPM is usually retarded more than the MAP is in this process (as this contributes to better fuel economy), so the increase in blade angle from reduced RPM outweighs the increased blade angle from decreased MAP, and the blade angle is increased overall.",

Next, knowing that the total pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure, we know that if one increases, the other must decrease to maintain a constant total pressure. Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! What this means for our question is that: Converging streamlines indicate a speed increase Diverging streamlines indicated a speed decrease A decrease in static pressure occurs with an increasing speed And an increase in static pressure occurs with a decreasing speed",

            "explanation": "The question is basically asking you how to check the proper operation of the pitch adjustment system (i.e. the CSU) of your variable pitch propeller just after engine start up. The engine is started with the condition lever (blue) in the low pitch-high RPM position in order to reduce the load on the propeller and facilitate the starting sequence and warm-up. While the engine warm-up, the constant speed unit of the propeller should be operated carefully and smoothly through its whole range to determine whether the system is working properly and as expected. It is also the right moment to distribute some warm oil through the CSU’s governor and warm it up before take-off. In a constant speed propeller piston engine, you will find 3 levers in the cockpit: the throttle lever, the condition lever, and the mixture control lever. The throttle lever controls the power output of the engine and is monitored on the MAP gauge (in inches of mercury). The mixture control lever varies the fuel flow and corrects for variations in the fuel/air ratio. Finally, the condition lever will control the pitch of the propeller to increase its efficiency and will be monitored on the tachometer as the RPM will change. Therefore, the pitch adjustment mechanism of the propeller will be checked by moving the blue lever to high pitch – low RPM, and then by moving it back to a low pitch setting, ready for take-off. All the RPM variations during this testing sequence will be monitored on the tachometer.",

            "explanation": "Each magneto is controlled by its own ignition switch. The switch isolates the magneto’s ignition circuit by connecting the circuit to Earth. In order to completely switch off the ignition system, the primary circuit needs to be grounded. However, if the grounding wire is broken for instance, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. This is because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a rough, rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply (many aircraft engines are normally shutoff by removing the fuel supply anyway). Caution! Maintenance action should be sought before approaching the propeller since the engine can start at any time with these conditions. As for the other options: A grounded switch wire in the magneto primary circuit will turn the magnetos off, so that is not a cause of the engine continuing to run. Fouled spark plugs are more likely to stop a running engine, and are unlikely to continue running an engine that has been switched off. A defective condenser will most likely make the engine run rough or stop in normal operations.",

These disadvantages can be reduced by creating redundancy within the system.

Turbocharger compresses the intake air when needed. Turbochargers are very useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which puts a lot of strain on the engine. A turbocharger works by using the speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then uses that energy to spin the compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. We cannot allow the turbocharger to run wild though, as too much pressure (MAP) can cause the engine to \"overboost\", and even fail quite spectacularly. The way we regulate the turbocharger is by varying how much air gets to the turbine, this is via a wastegate system. the exhaust gasses can go down two different tubes, one is a standard exhaust, straight out of the aircraft (bypassing the turbine). The other is a tube to the turbine, to spin up the turbocharger. The wastegate is a butterfly valve that can block the exhaust tube, so when it is closed, all the exhaust gasses go to the turbine, making the compressor/turbine spin fastest. As altitude rises, the waste gate gradually closes to enhance turbocharger boost. When fully closed, the turbocharger delivers maximum boost at the critical altitude.",

At a positive angle of attack, the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller, when viewed from the rear, is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade. If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment; a higher IAS (VMC) would be necessary to maintain directional control. At a given IAS, the situation would be more critical if the left engine failed. The rudder is used to prevent yaw, and the wings are maintained level with aileron. The fore and aft CG location has no effect on the yawing moment from a failed engine, but will influence the rudder arm, hence the rudder moment. CG on the aft limit will give the smallest rudder arm and the least ability to oppose the yawing moment from a failed engine. Video Explanation:",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

The cylinder walls, the piston head, the sparking plugs, and the exhaust valves are put under a sudden \"shock load\" when detonation occurs, and this will sound like a knocking inside the engine. Detonation puts an engine under intense shock loading which can quite quickly cause engine failures. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure, high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (the action is to retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

            "explanation": "A magneto is a self-contained, engine-driven electrical generator designed to supply a high voltage to the sparking plugs. This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. In order to break the gap between the sparking plug electrodes, the magnetos consist of a rotating permanent magnet surrounded by a U-shaped stator of soft iron, around which a thick primary and a thin secondary winding can be found. The thick winding (primary) is the low-tension element of the circuit and consists only of a few turns of thick wire. Whereas the thin winding (secondary) is the high-tension element of the circuit consisting of numerous thin windings that act as a step-up transformer. As a consequence of this arrangement, any electrical current in the primary circuit (thick winding) will induce a higher voltage in the secondary winding. Both windings will be supplied with alternating current from the permanent set of magnetos as they’re driven by the engine. Another important aspect you need to understand in the principle of magnetos operation is that the primary winding will be continuously broken and then restored by a contact breaker. The contact will be broken by a permanently rotating breaker cam whose main task is to break the primary circuit. The reason why we need the primary circuit to get broken is that this will create a collapse in the primary’s winding magnetic field that will produce an increase in energy in the secondary winding. The second reason is that the normal AC produced in the primary winding will be converted into a series of pulses. The general outcome of this sequence of actions will result in a series of very high voltage, low current pulses of electricity that will be fed to a distributor. The distributor’s task will be then to spread these pulses through a high-tension leads to the spark plugs.",

Under certain circumstances when the engine is very hot, vapor lock can also occur in the injector lines and prevent the fuel from being correctly delivered to the cylinders.",

Any further exam feedback is always useful, and can be put in the comments or emailed directly to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This question is similar to 213150, but asking about the other end of the spectrum. Also, this is a different question altogether from the similar looking question 219782, which is asking about yawing, where this question is more focused on maintaining continuous stable flight. They can be easily mistaken in an exam, but have different reasoning and answers. The critical engine part of the question does not really matter, either engine would have the same answer. Firstly, we are looking for anything that either increases the yawing moment caused by the engine failure (which we have to counteract using the rudder), or anything that reduces the effectiveness of our rudder, so we would have to use more of it to produce the same effect. Initially, we can say that the further forward our centre of gravity (CG), the larger the moment arm from the rudder to the CG, and the more effective our rudder is. Therefore, our rudder is least effective at an aft CG and we would need to put more stress through it to produce the same amount of moment. SIDESLIP Next, we have to consider the sideslip configuration of the aircraft, as well as how that is indicated on our instruments. Remember that the sideslip ball indicator is not useful in the usual sense when we have an engine failure, as it only really measures the direction of the \"local gravity\", the G-forces on the aircraft. 1) Wings-level flight The moment (turning force) of the asymmetric thrust must be counteracted by the rudder, which makes the aircraft maintain its heading, but causes it to track with a sideslip towards the dead engine (meaning that the airflow is coming at the aircraft from the side of the dead engine). This requires a lot of rudder to maintain, and leaves us in a sideslip condition with a lot of drag. Our sideslip ball indicator will be central in this configuration, therefore, even though this is a sideslip condition, it has \"no slip indication\". 2) Banking towards the live engine A small bank angle towards the operative engine (up to 5° AoB, \"five to the live\") can reduce or even remove the sideslip using the weight of the aircraft to counteract the tendency to fly away from the live engine. It is a commonly used configuration to acquire slightly more aircraft performance during an engine failure, but not too much bank angle, as that begins to negate the effect and reduce performance again. This reduces the required moment of the rudder (mostly because it is no longer having to fight the weather-cocking effect of the fin and aft fuselage) This reduces the aircraft's actual sideslip but a slip ball indicator would show approximately 1/2 a ball deflection to the operative engine. This is because there is no turning force and so the only G-force that the ball detects is straight down, and as we are banked, that means slightly towards whichever way we have banked (the live engine). Therefore, the correct answer to cause the most strain on the rudder is to have an aft CG and no slip indication (wings-level flight).",

For a gasoline (petrol) engine, the chemically correct air/fuel mixture to burn for maximum combustion efficiency is 15:1, so 15 grams of air for each 1 gram of fuel. This is called the stoichiometric ratio. This is not the best mixture to run a piston engine at though, as it leads to very hot combustion and can heat up the cylinders and pistons too much, causing damage. The weaker we run the mixture (more air, less fuel, for instance 16:1), the less fuel there is able to combust, so the engine runs slightly cooler, but produces less power. This is called running \"lean of peak\", and it is often the most economical way of flying piston engines in the cruise. Running an engine slightly richer than 15:1, say for instance 14:1, gives increased power (but less efficient combustion) due to slightly more fuel available for burning. It is still cooler than running at the chemically correct 15:1 ratio, though, as the extra fuel adds to cooling the engine. Running the mixture full rich, around 10:1 mixture, has a small reduction in maximum power, but gives increased engine reliability as the extra fuel not being burnt is used for engine cooling, and is very effective for keeping the cylinders and pistons cool. It is therefore what we use for take-off and landing, and any changes in power during flight.",

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.05: Explain the difference between an altitude-boosted turbocharger and a ground-boosted turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. Turbochargers (and any superchargers, really) increase the amount of air (and therefore fuel) we can ignite in the cylinders, so if we used full turbocharger at take-off, for instance, the forces on the engine would be enormous, and would put too much strain on an engine. We do this in road cars, because we can make engines stronger/heavier, and if they fail it is not life threatening, but with aircraft engines, we cannot afford to gain the extra power for fear of failure, so we simply use it to compensate for the reduction in air density. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use.",

Therefore, since the CSU also works on oil pressurized by the engine, it will become inoperative as well. Because of this, only two outside forces will act on the propeller’s blades: the centrifugal and the aerodynamic turning moment. The aerodynamic force will tend to move the blade pitch angle towards a coarse pitch, whereas the centrifugal force tends to turn the blade to a fine pitch. Since the centrifugal force is greater than the aerodynamic force, the propeller will be pushed to fine pitch by the centrifugal twisting moment and will create a solid resistive propeller disk that will resist against the relative airflow, creating a lot of drag. Additionally, the system also consists of a speeder spring that is directly linked to the RPM selection controller (blue lever). When there’s no more oil pressure, the spring will automatically move until the fine pitch stop by pushing all the oil out of the propeller hub and resulting in a drop in RPM.",

As long as you have visible moisture and the temperature is below +10°C (but also higher under certain conditions), the risk of icing becomes significant. “Low volatility of aviation fuel” – this property is not linked at all to carburetor icing. “Compression of air at the carburettor venturi” – compression will have the opposite reaction, the temperature and pressure will increase.

Any variations in engine power output (throttle pulled back or forward), which would otherwise produce a change in rpm, are sensed by the CSU which alters the propeller pitch angle to keep the rpm constant. If the throttle is pulled back, the propeller pitch would automatically decrease (fine pitch) but the RPM will remain the same, and vice-versa. The governor controls a hydraulic servo system feeding high-pressure oil, via a pilot valve, to a piston in the pitch change mechanism (PCM). The CSU operates on the principle of balancing a spring pressure against the centrifugal force of rotating governor flyweights, driven directly from the engine or reduction gearbox. Usually, in a piston engine, the governor flyweights are tensioned by a speeder spring, which is controlled from the cockpit by setting the RPM lever. In a turboprop, however, the most efficient engine RPM is maintained by pre-tensioning the speeder spring to give the maximum engine RPM at all times.",

Any further exam feedback is always useful, and can be put in the comments or emailed directly to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This is very similar to question 214523, but asking about the other end of the spectrum. CG CONSIDERATIONS Firstly, we are looking for anything that either decreases the yawing moment caused by the engine failure (which we would usually have to counteract using the rudder), or anything that increases the effectiveness of our rudder, so we would have to use less of it to produce the same effect. Initially, we can say that the further forward our centre of gravity (CG), the larger the moment arm from the rudder to the CG, and the more effective our rudder is. Therefore, our rudder is most effective at a forward CG and we would need to put less stress through it to produce the same amount of moment. SIDESLIP Next, we have to consider the sideslip configuration of the aircraft, as well as how that is indicated on our instruments. Remember that the sideslip ball indicator is not useful in the usual sense when we have an engine failure, as it only really measures the direction of the \"local gravity\", the G-forces on the aircraft. 1) First consider wings-level flight. The moment (turning force) of the asymmetric thrust must be counteracted by the rudder, which makes the aircraft maintain its heading, but causes it to track with a sideslip towards the dead engine (meaning that the airflow is coming at the aircraft from the side of the dead engine). This requires a lot of rudder to maintain, and leaves us in a sideslip condition with a lot of drag. Our sideslip ball indicator will be central in this configuration, therefore, even though this is a sideslip condition, it has \"no slip indication\" 2) Banking towards the live engine A small bank angle towards the operative engine (up to 5° AoB, \"five to the live\") can reduce or even remove the sideslip using the weight of the aircraft to counteract the tendency to fly away from the live engine. It is a commonly used configuration to acquire slightly more aircraft performance during an engine failure, but not too much bank angle, as that begins to negate the effect and reduce performance again. This reduces the required moment of the rudder (mostly because it is no longer having to fight the weather-cocking effect of the fin and aft fuselage) This reduces the aircraft's actual sideslip but a slip ball indicator would show approximately 1/2 a ball deflection to the operative engine. This is because there is no turning force and so the only G-force that the ball detects is straight down, and as we are banked, that means slightly towards whichever way we have banked (the live engine). Therefore, the correct answer to cause the least strain on the rudder is to have a forward CG and 1/2 ball slip indication towards the operative engine (aircraft banked slightly towards the live engine).",

A dry sump engine is one where the oil is not allowed to sit in the engine sump for too long, and is instead \"scavenged\" back to a separate reservoir. This is the opposite of a \"wet sump\" engine, where the sump (within the engine casing) is the reservoir, and a lot less systems are required, but with reduced engine power due to losses. With a dry sump engine, the oil enters from the reservoir via a pressure pump (along with filters, coolers, and some sensors), getting it up to a suitable pressure to spray inside the engine. The oil then lubricates, cools and cleans the engine components, finally ending up at the bottom of the engine, where it gathers in the sump, and is collected up by a scavenge pump (more filters as well), which returns it to the reservoir. The oil is often quite aerated and foamy by this point, so is less dense, and the scavenge pump needs a larger volume to cope with this oil, and not let it mount up in the sump. The scavenge pump also needs to be a higher volume than the pressure pump, as the other way around would force more and more oil into the engine, and would create a potential flooding of the sump, which is supposed to hold oil only for a short amount of time, potentially damaging the engine by having too much oil.",

Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply. Caution!

In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Wet-sump systems are quite common on ground vehicle engines and older aircraft engines, as they are less complex than dry-sump systems, and therefore are less prone to failure. They do have a fair few disadvantages, though. These include not being able to properly oil the engine during some aerobatic manoeuvres, and a reduced amount of oil capacity, and reduced cooling capacity, due to the oil only being stored in the bottom of the engine.

The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

This is why you have to perform a magneto check before departure, also called mag drop. You will perform this twice, at different power settings: idle and about 75% of maximum. After you set your engine at one of these power settings, you will switch off each magneto in turn and check that the RPM drops within specific limits (usually 100 RPM) and the engine runs smoothly. As a result you will find out that if one of the magnetos fails during flight, engine power is not significantly compromised. If, however, during the mag drop checks you notice that the engine stops it would indicate that one half of the magnetos isn’t properly working, whereas if there’s no drop in RPM it means that one half of the ignition system is not being earthed and maintenance support should be seek.",

It has control over every available part of the engine, from fuel-air mixture to ignition timing and even the propeller controller for variable pitch propellers. Ignition timing is the point in the 4 stroke engine cycle where the air/fuel mixture is ignited, and as RPM increases, the ignition timing should get earlier in the cycle to provide best efficiency. In a diesel engine this is the point where the fuel is injected, as it immediately ignites. The advantages of FADEC on piston engines include: Reduced weight Optimum efficiency No possibility of exceeding engine limitations Easy engine diagnostics There are also disadvantages to FADEC, which include: High complexity 2 ECUs are required to avoid a single point of failure No ability to gain excess power out of the engine in a crisis (e.g. terrain escape) Complete electrical failure means an engine failure (or uncontrollable engines)",

In fact, the rate of pressure rise will occur too early in the power stroke for the piston to move downwards. Therefore, most of the chemical energy created will be wasted as heat. The cylinder walls, the piston’s head, the sparking plugs and the exhaust valves are being hardly damaged when detonation occurs as this will cause a sudden knock. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure leading to a high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a toolow octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburetor heating at high power settings (takeoff/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (= retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which puts a lot of strain on the engine. A turbocharger works by using the speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then uses that energy to spin the compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. We cannot allow the turbocharger to run wild though, as too much pressure (MAP) can cause the engine to \"overboost\", and even fail quite spectacularly. The way we regulate the turbocharger is by varying how much air gets to the turbine, this is via a wastegate system. the exhaust gasses can go down two different tubes, one is a standard exhaust, straight out of the aircraft (bypassing the turbine). The other is a tube to the turbine, to spin up the turbocharger. The wastegate is a butterfly valve that can block the exhaust tube, so when it is closed, all the exhaust gasses go to the turbine, making the compressor/turbine spin fastest. When the engine reaches its maximum MAP, the oil system which regulates the wastegate begins to open it, letting some of the \"waste\" air straight out of the aircraft, so it does not continue to run the turbine, which might overboost the engine.",

In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the external oil reservoir and then pumped back to the engine to work again. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine crankcase, where the oil naturally drains to. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Wet-sump systems are quite common on ground vehicle engines and older aircraft engines, as they are less complex than dry-sump systems, and therefore are less prone to failure. They do have a fair few disadvantages, though. These include not being able to properly oil the engine during some aerobatic manoeuvres, and a reduced amount of oil capacity, and reduced cooling capacity, due to the oil only being stored in the bottom of the engine. There are also some small performance losses due to more oil splashing about in the bottom of the engine.",

For this reason, diesel engines are not fitted with spark plugs and are not heated (except in icing conditions), and require less maintenance and spare parts which ultimately reduces costs. The mixture creation is also different from the standard petrol engines as the diesel engines use direct fuel injection systems to mix the fuel and the air in a pre-chamber before supplying it to the cylinder. The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way, as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

It is connected in parallel with the turbocharger. A constant MAP at the diffuser stage (after leaving the impeller) can be maintained by controlling the amount of gas directed to the turbine. The waste gate hydraulic actuator is continuously supplied with engine oil and returns back to the engine through a variable restrictor. When the restrictor is closed, the actuator will be pressurized with engine oil pressure, that will force the actuator’s piston to move, and thus closing the waste gate. When the waste gate fully closes, it directs all the exhaust gases to the turbine, causing it to accelerate. This is exactly what will happen at a high cruising altitude. The waste gate will be fully closed, and the turbine will accelerate to its maximum causing an excessive increase in pressurized air, and thus, a potential exceedance of the maximum allowed MAP.",

We have chosen an answer, but are very aware that the correct option may be different in the exam, depending on what the actual question says, and what the examiner means. Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this so we can verify the question, thank you! There are two main types of oil system for engines, dry-sump and wet-sump. The biggest difference between the two is where the oil stored when not in use. In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the oil reservoir. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. In a dry-sump system, the engine oil is collected in the sump, then pumped back into an external reservoir, where it is stored when not in the engine. Wet sump systems are simpler and cheaper, but they have a smaller oil capacity than dry-sump systems, and often have problems cooling the engine during aerobatic manoeuvres, and reduce engine performance slightly due to splashing, etc. Therefore, this question is not describing any single type of oil system. The oil is kept underneath the engine (wet-sump systems keep it at the bottom of the engine, we do not consider this the same). There is no external reservoir (therefore it cannot be a dry sump system). The oil capacity is \"higher\", which is the characteristic of a dry sump, not a wet sump system. As mentioned above, the correct answer could also be \"wet sump\" if the question is different to what we have, but so far we do not have enough information to say for sure.",

The ram air is derived from the propeller slipstream and the aircraft’s forward movement through the air. In order to properly spread the cool ram air over each cylinder and reduce the drag generated the engine is cowled. Along with a cowl flap or gills, it will avoid having excessive cooling over the cylinders situated at the FRONT of the engine in comparison to those situated slightly backward. Because of the lower maintenance costs, ram air cooling is the preferred method to cool the simple general aviation aircraft.",
