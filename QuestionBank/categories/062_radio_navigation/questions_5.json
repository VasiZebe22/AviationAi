However, based on the information provided in the question (RMI Deviation), we can infer that the RMI readings will be relative to Compass North. Given that the ADF is tuned to an NDB, the ADF needle on the RMI works as follows: The Tip of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing to the NDB (300°). The Tail of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing from the NDB (120°). In this case, we assume that the RMI is subjected to electromagnetic interference and therefore, deviation is applied: -2ºW (westerly deviation) ⇒ Compass North is 2° West of Magnetic North. Let’s start by converting compass heading to magnetic heading: Deviation west, compass best; Deviation east, compass least Magnetic Bearing to the NDB = Compass Bearing to the NDB - 002° = 300° - 002° = 298° Since the question asks for true bearing, we need to correct for magnetic variation: Variation west, magnetic best; Variation east, magnetic least. Remember that for NDB/ADF bearings the bearings are taken at the aircraft, therefore the magnetic variation applicable at the aircraft's position is to be used: Variation at the DR position = 22° West ⇒ Magnetic North is 22° West of True North True Bearing to the NDB = Magnetic Bearing to the NDB - 022° = 298° - 022° = 276°",

This accuracy is particularly noticeable when the aircraft is at a low altitude and relatively far away from the DME station, within the line of sight. In this example, the pilot is following a DME arc during an approach procedure. Therefore, the pilot keeps a constant DME read-out in order to remain on the arc (i.e. 15 DME arc). This means that DME measured by the aircraft is not changing, and the rate of change in the detected distance from the station is zero.

The most extreme case of \"slant range error\" occurs when the aircraft passes directly over the station; instead of reading zero, the DME shows the altitude of the airplane above the station (in nautical miles). Slant range error also affects groundspeed and time-to-station displays when you're close to the station. Displayed DME groundspeed drops below actual groundspeed as you approach the station and then climbs back to normal after you pass it. Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station. The DME range (slant range) can be calculated using the following formula: True Range = √ ( Slant range 2 – Aircraft height 2 ) NOTE: Range and Height must be in same units e.g. Nautical Miles! In our case: 1 NM = 6 080 ft 6 000 ft correspond at 0.99 NM True Range = √ ( Slant range 2 – Aircraft height 2 ) True Range = √ (52 – 0.99 2 ) True Range = √ (25– 0.98 2 ) True Range = √ 24.02 True Range = 4.9 NM",

With these types of questions, you must look for which coordinates are the same. In this case, the 98ºE longitude is the same for both, meaning that the aircraft and the VOR/DME are on the same meridian. Looking at the coordinates again, the aircraft is directly south (True South) of the beacon. The question asks for the direction the aircraft must fly for the DME groundspeed readout to read correctly. As the DME groundspeed readout uses \"rate of change of DME distance\" as the method for calculating groundspeed, then the only way for it to read correctly is by flying directly towards or directly away from the DME. Technically, going directly away slightly reduces the errors due to slant distance vs ground distance, as the aircraft is getting further from the DME, which is more accurate. This does not affect this question though, as the radial is the same one no matter which direction we fly along it. As the aircraft is directly True South from the beacon, then the radial that the aircraft would be flying on is whatever is True South of the VOR, so we must simply work out what magnetic radial corresponds to True South at the beacon. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 167º 13ºE (+) 180 We need to use the variation at the VOR as that is where the radial directions were decided, and emitted. Therefore, the aircraft must fly along radial 167º",

The bearing can be used to navigate to or from the station or to help establish a fixed position. VDF bearing information will only be given when conditions are satisfactory and radio bearings fall within the calibrated limits of the station. There are 4 factors that affect the accuracy of a VDF: Propagation error and site error cause by aircraft’s transmissions being reflected from terrain as they travel to the site, or being reflected from buildings at the site. Aircraft attitude, the VDF system and VHF communications are vertically polarized, therefore the most accurate is when the aircraft flies straight and level. Poor accuracy is likely in the overhead of a VDF receiver. The reception of both direct wave and ground reflected wave can cause signal fading or loss. Together with other multi path signals this gives rise to bearing errors. Transmissions done at the same time by two or more aircraft will cause momentary errors in bearings.",

            "explanation": "The Difference in Depth Modulation (DDM) is a principle used by the ILS to define a position in an airspace. The deviation detection of the aircraft from the desired track is based on two different overlapping lobes. These lobes are radiated by both the localiser and the glide path antennas. These consist of a 90 Hz lobe and a 150 Hz lobe. For the glide path: When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 90 Hz lobe than the 150 Hz lobe, it means that the aircraft is above the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 150 Hz lobe than the 90 Hz lobe, the aircraft will be below the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When both signals are received at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the ‘ideal’ glideslope and the glideslope needle will indicate zero. Assume that you are on the centreline, if you move away from the centrelline/ideal glide slope the DDM will increase. DDM = AM (90 hz) - AM (150 hz) / 100 Therefore, once you go off centreline/ideal glide slope, either the 90 or 150 increases, causing DDM to increase (negative is also assumed to be an increase).",

Uneven terrain might interfere with the ILS. Multipath interference to ILS depends on the type of antenna used and any large reflecting objects in the area, like mountains. Moving objects can degrade the directional signals that the interference on the system will be too high to be tolerated.",

There is not much more to explain, except that NDBs are only properly usable when they travel as surface waves (radio waves which cling to the surface of the earth.). This is because the direction of the incoming beam matters to their accuracy by their very nature, and is much less accurate if it has been \"reflected\" off the ionosphere. It is for this reason that there is a \"night effect\", when the sky waves reflect much more from the ionosphere and return to the aircraft, interfering with the surface waves to cause difficulty in measurements.",

In general we can affirm that there is a difference between Ground Range and Slant Range but that difference is negligible and not worth considering until you are VERY close to the beacon, at which point plotting becomes quite immaterial and difficult owing to the relatively rapid changes in distance, i.e. 3 NM change in range is not significant when 150 NM from the beacon but it is significant when you are only 5 NM from the beacon. As a rule of thumb, discrepancies only start to appear within 1 NM per 1,000' of height, e.g. when flying at 10,000' the discrepancies only start to appear within 10 NM, at 20,000 within 20 NM, etc. Even then, they are very small and hardly worth worrying about, e.g. at 35,000' 35 NM Ground Distance = 35.6 NM DME Distance, and 10 NM Gnd Dist = 12 NM DME Dist. Note: In case you’ll find one of these two questions in our exam, the suggestion is to write a report explaining that ICAO Annex 10 does not contain a decisive definition and we have been unable to locate one anywhere, apart from the CASA publication which itself does not state 'SLANT' range but states 'DME' range, although these are popularly held to be the same.",

            "explanation": "All ILS Marker beacons operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the threshold. The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“• - • - • - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“• • • • •”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white)",

The first one provides information about how far an aircraft is horizontally from the correct inbound course, called azimuth guidance (similar to ILS localiser). The second one provides similar information about how far the aircraft is from the correct glide path, called elevation guidance. There is a third transmitter that is used to allow curved and segmented MLS procedures to take place also, called the DME/P, which is a more precise version of a standard DME. With this in use also, the aircraft can have the knowledge of its 3-dimensional position for much more complex (not straight-in) approaches. The azimuth and elevation transmitters work in the same way, they emit a beam that \"scans\" the sky, side-to-side (to and fro) for the azimuth guidance, up-and-down for the elevation beam. The aircraft then detects how much time passed inbetween the beams being detected, (between the \"to\" and the \"fro\" beam, for instance), and can very accurately detect its angular distance from the inbound course/glide path. The azimuth beam does not constantly scan to-fro-to-fro., but has a break whilst the elevation beam does it's own scan, and they alternate with each other. (with data being passed also through the frequency at set intervals).",

Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echoes appear on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. => Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence and wind shear directly, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water. In more modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence. => This function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence. The mention of Doppler techniques makes this the correct answer immediately. This very useful function can provide inputs that are computed alongside the Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs) and the air data computer to provide localised windshear warnings, which are then usually annunciated by the EGPWS system.",

Airborne Weather Radars work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Usually, this blocking return is a very heavy cumulonimbus cloud, full of large rain and hail.",

The secondary use consists of tilting the AWR more downwards below the horizon, where it will look for reflections from the nearby land. This is the \"mapping\" mode, and the AWR actually has a separate beam transmission pattern that is best suited to receive accurate ground returns.

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Here we can see that the very intense cell above aerodrome A is blocking the vast majority of returns in a corridor of shadow behind it. Therefore, Aerodrome B's precipitation is unknown. Aerodrome C, however, is not shadowed by a huge cell, and the low intensity green cell in front of it is not enough to block the majority of the pulses. \"Fly straight ahead\" Incorrect. If the pilots continue straight ahead, they will come across an area of intense activity. \"Fly straight ahead to avoid A, turn left to B and then go back on course.\" and \"Direct to B and then go back on course.\" Incorrect. \"A\" is a very intense cell which is blocking the weather behind it. \"Direct to C and then go back to course.\" Correct. Turning to \"C\" seems to be the safest option.",

Consequently, a false response is triggered. To overcome this issue, a P2 pulse is added to the signal. which is used between pairs of pulses as a control pulse to prove response validity. The spacing between P1 and P2 is fixed at at 2 μs. This causes the P2 polar to be superimposed onto the pulse pair signal. The only time the P2 signal strength is smaller than that of P1 and P3, the signal is received in the main lobe. Reception in the sidelobe results in a higher signal strength of P2. The receiver compares the magnitude of the pulses and if the P2 pulse is larger than the interrogation pulse, the response is denied. Therefore, it only replies to interrogation by the main beam - this is called Side Lobe Suppression (SLS). If the combined P2 signal is stronger => aircraft in a side lobe. If the combined P2 signal is smaller => aircraft in a main lobe.",

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) have been created so that the pulses the emit reflect best off objects that are the same size as large water droplets hailstones. One of the primary tasks of an AWR system is to detect upcoming turbulence and bad weather, so that the pilots can take necessary precautions or avoiding action. The largest areas of turbulence come from cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, which contain large droplets of water, ice crystals, and hail stones. Modern AWRs are set up to have a wavelength of approximately 3cm, so they bounce off these types of precipitation the most. The radars have been tuned this way to make sure that more radar returns means that there is a higher chance of turbulence in that area. Usually, the bigger the hail/droplets, the worse the turbulence. The radar pulses will always reflect off wet hail and large water droplets better than they will off smaller water droplets, dry hail and ice crystals.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self-stabilising at a particular attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, then reduced during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (such as developing thunderstorms) that could affect the aircraft. It should be kept low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display.",

Whilst the learning objectives do not specify the frequency band of airborne weather radars, it is a very common question, and the answer is that AWRs operate in the SHF band (Super High Frequency). This can also be calculated using the formula; speed of light = frequency x wavelength rearranged is; frequency = speed of light / wavelength frequency = 3x108 (m/s) / 0.03 (m) = 1x1010 (Hz) The frequency is therefore around 10 GHz, which is between 3 and 30 GHz, and is therefore in the SHF band, as shown in the annex above. As it turns out, the exact wavelength used is 3.2 cm and therefore the selected frequency for AWR is 9.375 GHz (9375 MHz). AWR must be optimised not to detect very small particles such as thin fog but to accurately identify rain and hail particles within storms. Too small wavelengths will result in reflection from very small particles. Larger wavelengths result in the waves bending around particles of interest.",

Airborne Weather Radars have 2 main functions, weather detection and ground mapping. Pilots look ahead using their AWR to pick the a route using areas of best weather and least turbulence. Turbulence can be detected by modern AWRs, but not ALL areas of turbulence, as CAT (clear air turbulence) has no associated particles which can reflect radar pulses; it is invisible by definition. Standard turbulence within clouds can be detected, as the movement of the precipitation within the cloud causes a doppler shift on the returning radar pulses, so the radar can form an idea of the air movement patterns in that area. If they are erratic, then turbulence exists in that region. This question is not referring to the mapping mode. For one, the mapping mode has been used for over 70 years, so is not only used in \"modern\" weather radars. Also, the mapping is not very good at displaying mountainous terrain, and would never be used for such applications. It would also be very difficult to navigate via ground feagtures using it over the clouds, as the clouds would reflect many pulses, making it innacurate.",

Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

            "explanation": "Power is defined as the rate of energy transfer per second. The higher power an antenna is, the stronger its signals, and therefore the further the signals will be able to travel before being fully absorbed by the atmosphere. A pulse radar fires a pulse for a short time, then waits a much longer time to look for any reflected signals from any potential objects in its path. We do not want to measure the radar’s power when it is waiting, as there is no power output during that time. This is why we measure the energy emitted over the period of the pulse width only, and then we can average that power over the pulse width to find the power of the radar pulse. The big problem with this question is that there are two answers which are correct. As the radar fires a pulse of near enough continuous energy (for that short time), the peak power can be referred to as the pulse power, as they are usually the same value. This is the same as \"power measured over the period of the pulse width\", as a radar pulse should produce a continuous amount of power during the pulse width. The big thing to remember is that the average power output of the radar is much less than the pulse power (peak power), as this value has then been averaged out over the whole pulse cycle, which is mostly filled with no power output (see annex above). Note: There has been recent feedback from two authorities that the correct answer is \"peak pulse power\", but if the option \"power measured over the period of the pulse width\" also appears, then an appeal (and certainly a comment - if possible) could be made, as we believe this is an equally correct answer. Any exam feedback on this would also be useful, thank you.",

The tilt depends on the flight altitude and the altitude of the next flight phase. In mountainous regions, for instance, high peaks may trigger the AWR to show solid echoes even though they are produced by the ground. For this reason, when the aircraft descends to a lower altitude, a higher tilt setting is more beneficial to avoid reflections from the ground (\"ground clutter\"). The opposite is also true and when climbing to a high flight altitude, the tilt setting should be lower to ensure the scanning beam is not above the significant weather and detection is possible.",

Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets.

The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. For example, a water particle is five times more reflective than an ice particle of the same size. Good returns are ensured on heavy rain-bearing clouds (cumulus type).

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear. * Green: light precipitation, slight turbolence * Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation,light turbolence * Red: heavy precipitation, medium to severe turbolence * Magenta: Extremely high precipitation, severe turbolence Conventional weather radar cannot detect wind speed or turbulence directly, it only detects solid and liquid objects above a threshold size. The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice. Note that the areas in which the concentration of droplets decreases rapidly (which are marked on the radar screen by a sharp fall in signal intensity) are normally areas in which the most severe turbulence can be encountered. These are areas in which the strong up-going air currents are in close proximity to downward flowing currents and there is a strong risk of severe vertical wind shear. These areas will be identified on the radar screen by a rapid change in appearance of the cloud return - steep change in colors of the return (steep color gradient). If you identify this area on your radar screen, avoid that area! So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water. It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence. Clear air turbulence (CAT) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar. There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft.",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Airborne weather radar is typically Xband, pulse modulated and operating in the 8-12 Ghz range (wavelenght approx. 3 cm). The shape of the radar beam is very important in the design of a radar. For purposes of airborne weather radar, a narrow beam is the most desirable because it concentrates more energy on the target, which means more energy will come back in the echo. Flat Plate antennas are better than dish antennas and larger antennas are better than smaller antennas for concentrating the beam. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a radar will determine its maximum range. The PRF must be long enough to allow the echo pulses to return from the maximum range target. The longer the required range, the lower the PRF Scanning speed comes into play with the PRF since a high scanning speed and low PRF would cause targets to be missed. At least one pulse should be transmitted per a beam width of scan. Pulse width will determine the minimum range of the radar and also the resolution size of the target. If a target is close and the echo is reflected back to the radar while the transmitter pulse is still being transmitted, then obviously that target will be missed. Most radars I have worked with had a pulse width of less than 4 microseconds so this isn’t a problem. Also, many radars will shorten their pulse width in map mode allowing a higher degree of resolution for ground targets such as shorelines or islands.",

            "explanation": "PRF ( Pulse Recurrence Frequency ) is the number of pulses trasmitted in a second. PRF is one of the main factors that determine the maximum theoretical unambiguous range of a pulse radar. The trasmitter must remain “silent” while the receiver is “listening” for echoes. If the design maximum range is 200NM the receiver must be allowed to “listen” for the period of time fro when a pulse has been trasmitted untill it can go to 200NM and than return. That is a round trip of 400 NM, which would require a longer “silent period” than a radar whit a range of 100NM where the pulses have to travel only 200NM. Therefore we can say that a lower PRF enables a longer maximum theoretical range: max therorical range is inversly proportional to the PRF. The following formula may be used to calculate the max theoretical unambiguous range : Range (in Km) = 300 000 ÷ ( PRF x 2 ), or if we need to find the required PRF based on a specific unambiguous range needed, we can rearrange the formula: PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( Range (in Km) x 2) In our case we can apply the second one. 1 NM = 1.852 km so 200 x 1.852 = 370.4 Km PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( 370.4 x 2 ) PRF = 404.97 pps = approx. 405 pps",

Instead of waiting for pulse reflections, SSR sends out specific interrogations to aircraft SSR transponders. These interrogations are transmitted at a frequency of 1030 MHz. In response, the aircraft transponder emits its own series of reply pulses on a separate frequency of 1090 MHz. This causes SSR range to increase due to the active participation of the airborne equipment, since only a quarter of the power is required to travel half the distance. So with the same power output, an increased range can be achieved. In Mode A the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. In Mode C the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting Mode S are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

Mode S transponders are a natural continuation of the Mode A and Mode C transponders. The mode A transponder is able to sent a 4 digit squawk code, of which there are only 4096 individual identities, Mode S can handle 16 million different ICAO 24 bit aircraft addresses (AAs). These AAs are unique addresses registered to a particular aircraft. There is also a much larger ability for transfer of information through mode S, with many different aircraft parameters able to be transferred to the ground through ELS (elementary surveillance) or EHS (enhanced surveillance) systems, and even a capacity of communications via datalink. Mode S transponders use the same frequencies as Mode A/C transponders, so are backwards compatible, and the SSR ground station produces different interrogation pulses to require a response from a particular mode S transponder (or can \"all-call\" mode S transponders). The Mode S transponder also receives information from TCAS interrogations from nearby aircraft, and replies with information such as range, bearing and altitude to aid TCAS separation. Mode S transponders are key to TCAS operation, and are very closely linked. The other options in these answers could not be correct. In primary radar, there is a reflection, not a reply. ADS-B is a system which relies on un-requested output signals from the aircraft's transponder, called squitters. These squitters also aid TCAS identification.",

The system's effectiveness depends on the moisture content and size of the precipitation, with wetter and larger precipitation yielding more favorable reflectivity and stronger radar returns. Notably, radar returns are most robust when encountering wet hail, while radar returns from ice crystals and dry snow tend to be less distinct. On the radar display, stronger returns typically appear as red, while weaker returns are depicted in green, and yellow represents returns of intermediate strength. Magenta colour may be used to indicate areas of turbulence. The Airborne Weather Radar (AWR) system autonomously maintains a specific attitude by utilizing the IRS (Inertial Reference System) attitude system. Consequently, it remains unaffected by changes in the aircraft's pitch. Moreover, the AWR system offers flexibility in setting various vertical tilt angles, allowing the flight crew to tailor its functionality to their requirements. Recommended tilt settings are: high tilt at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into reduced tilt during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (i.e. developing thunderstorms) low tilt in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around the aircraft tilt raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns",

Turbulence is displayed in magenta. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence. Activating the turbulence mode means the radar will not just be looking at where the return pulses come from and their distance, but also any frequency shift in the returning pulse. If the frequency has changed, then the thing the pulse bounced off must itself be moving - which in turn, implies movement of the air, and turbulence. Note that pulses must have something to bounce off (ideally, large droplets) - they cannot detect clear air turbulence.",

MODE S (Selective Addressing) Enables data exchange using communications protocols. Mode S data link can serve as an alternative or supplementary method for various ATC services that are traditionally carried out using VHF voice communications. This utilization of data link technology enhances the safety and reliability of the ATC system by minimizing errors associated with voice-based communication.

The pilot may manually transmit a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse when the \"IDENT\" button on the pilot's transponder is pressed. The benefit of the squawk \"IDENT\" function is a manual identification of the aircraft. The controller may ask via the radio communication frequency to \"IDENT\" in case of any doubt of identification on the controller's display. Upon acquisition of the SPI pulse, the indication of that aircraft begins to flash on the display of the controller. This produces a distinctive display so that a controller can pick out a particular aircraft by asking the pilot to “Squawk Ident”. It is one of the many ways that controllers can link an aircraft on frequency to one on their RADAR display.

The wetter and larger the precipitation, the better the reflectivity, the stronger the returns. Wet hail gives the best returns, whereas ice crystals and dry snow do not give good radar returns. Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The thin pencil beam of the radar scans the area ahead of the aircraft horizontally, and the pilots can choose to manually adjust the vertical tilt of the beam. This can be used to detect the tops (or even bases) of clouds, given a small diagram and a basic knowledge of trigonometry. The AWR will only display returns when it is pointed at an area containing precipitation, in this case a storm cloud. When we tilt the radar beam high enough, it will no longer see the cloud, at which point the returns in that area of the screen will stop, and this is the angle between the aircraft and the top of the cloud. Given that we know the range from the storm, which is already on our AWR display, we can calculate the relative height of the top of the cloud, and therefore the approximate altitude of the top, using the following formula: Cloud Tops = Range(ft) x (Radar Tilt Angle -1/2 Beam Width)",

Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale. A typical three-color system will be green, yellow and red, with red being the most severe. A typical four-color system will be green, yellow, red and magenta, with magenta being the most severe.",

Please let us know if you get this question in an exam, as the current feedback is limited and we would like to verify it, thank you! Whilst this is a bit of an odd question, it is answerable. an aircraft's altitude can be expressed a few different ways in flight. It could be expressed as height, either over the terrain (using radio altimeter) or over an airport (using the airport QFE pressure setting). It can be expressed in altitude, using a QNH pressure setting from a nearby airport or the regional pressure setting. It can also be expressed as a flight level, which is when the altimeter is set to standard pressure (1013.25 hPa), whilst above the transition layer. In this question, for whatever reason, the student pilot has set 1013.2 hPa in their altimeter subscale before departure, this means that they will be receiving height information in the form of pressure altitude, or their \"flight level\" (when divided by 100, from ft to FL). Some may argue that they could just be setting the airport's QNH, and therefore the altimeter would read out their \"altitude\", this is not the case, as a QNH value is never decimal, only ever a whole number (and is always rounded down for safety), so 1013.2 hPa must be for the standard pressure setting.",

It uses a ground-installed transmitter and receiver that is the interrogator component of the system and the aircraft is also equipped with a transmitter and a receiver. There is therefore a two-way communication, unlike the echo principle. The Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) has several advantages over the primary radar. The major advantage being less power is required for the aerial. Since the minimum transmission power requirement is based on the distance to the aircraft, power echo creation is not necessary. The transmission completed by the transponder also results in stronger signals compared to the primary radar, meaning that the receiver sensitivity may be lower. These two factors combined lead to a smaller aerial requirement with lower installation costs.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR): The radar antenna rotates (usually at 5-12 rpm) emits a pulse of radio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the antenna. The PSR output data uses polar coordinate system: it provides range and bearing of the targets found in respect of the antenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from the antenna and not the horizontal distance. The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse (the speed of propagation is the speed of light) and the bearing is obtained from the antenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the antenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. The antenna radiation patern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, whith some approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) requires an airborne transponder which responds to the receipt of a pulse from a ground-based antenna by transmitting a return signal. Because the transponder transmits a much stronger signal than that which is reflected off an aircraft in primary radar systems, reater range and reliability can be achieved with secondary radar and cheaper and more efficient ground equipment can be used. Additionally, information such as altitude and a code can be added to the returned signal from the transponder which is then displayed on the operator’s screen. In Mode A the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. The code system is octal; that is, each of the code digits may be any of the numbers 0-7. There are thus 4096 possible four-digit codes. In Mode C the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting Mode S are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. This reduces problems of garbling between SSR returns from aircraft in close proximity. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

That is why all large aircraft are equipped with an airborne weather radar. The Airborne Weather Radar (AWR) system fitted on large aircraft uses a primary radar system to look for reflections from precipitation in clouds. The wetter and larger the precipitation, the better the reflectivity, the stronger the returns. Wet hail gives the best returns, whereas ice crystals and dry snow do not give good radar returns. Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence). Convective weather has bigger, wetter precipitation, which makes for stronger radar returns. The Radar works the same as any other pulse radar, by pointing in a particular direction and firing off a pulse of electromagnetic radiation (in the microwave band), then waiting for a reply from any potential reflections in that area. It then measures the time of arrival of the reflection, and uses this to calculate the distance from the target (as the pulses travel at the speed of light). Collision detection such as TCAS is usually provided through secondary radar, with pulses and replies, rather than reflections.",

            "explanation": "Note: this was supposedly removed from the learning objectives for the 2020 syllabus, however, there are numerous counts of feedback that this question is still being asked. The feedback is currently conflicting as to the options and the correct answer (in EASA's eyes), so we cannot currently give an exact representation of the question and required answer. We are aware that currently, there are 2 possible correct answers present, which would be somthing to comment on in an exam (and appeal after if necessary). Any further exam feedback would be very useful, and can be put directly in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. The slotted planar array was developed to reduce the reflectivity and the side-lobes associated with parabolic antennas. Slotted planar array antennas use a flat receiver (compared to the concave receiver of a parabolic antenna) with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, so that the reflected radar energy is gathered in a more efficient way. The advantage of such a radar is that there is less energy lost through sidelobes and a narrower beam (typically 3º rather than 5º with older systems). The annex above is a slotter planar array, which would then be mounted in the nose cone of an aircraft (sometimes under the wing for large single engine aircraft). Almost all airborne weather radars have a mapping mode, and in the past it was a very useful tool for navigation, especially when it comes to navigating around the regions of coastlines. These days, it is not nearly as well used, as the common use of moving maps and GNSS/FMS navigation have made it a little unnecessary. AWR mapping can be done by simply tilting the AWR downwards towards the ground, but it produces quite a broken/cluttered display of terrain. The better way to do it in the past was to use a cosecant squared beam, which is a different radiation pattern to the standard pencil beam used for picking up weather returns. The cosecant squared beam uses different amounts of pulses in different directions to prioritise the ground better than the pencil beam, and allows for a better (less broken) view of the ground ahead. The AWR does still need to be tilted downwards from the horizontal for this to work, but on some systems the use of the \"MAP\" mode will do that automatically. Weather radars point forwards (and a certain degree left and right of the nose) so are not omnidirectional.",

The 4 answers below should each be individually explained; SELCAL - SELCAL is the shortened form of \"selective calling\", which is used by ATC to inform a particular aircraft to begin monitoring the frequency. It is primarily used for communication over long distances, when HF radio is in use. It allows an aircraft to turn the radio down and not listen so intently on frequency to the potentially bad HF signal, as the aircraft will get an indication when ATC are trying to reach them. It uses a 4 digit code which is entered on the flight plan, and does not require any such \"log on\". CPDLC - Controller-Pilot Data-Link Communications. This is a method of using datalink to establish text based communications between the aircraft and ATC. It does require a log on phase - also known as the notification phase - which allows identification to take place, and the aircraft to be connected to the network. D-ATIS - Digital ATIS or Data-link ATIS, This is a broadcast that our aircraft can pick up, which gives a text-based readout of the standard ATIS at an aerodrome. It does not require a log on, and any suitably equipped aircraft can pick it up. ADS-B - Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast, This is a system which broadcasts an aircraft's position (along with many other pieces of information) to other aircraft and to ATC. As this is the B type of ADS, meaning broadcast, the aircraft will continuously output information bursts known as \"squitters\", and any suitably equipped ADS-in aircraft or controller will be able to receive this information.

It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth.

Learning Objective 062.03.01.01.01: Name the different applications of radar with respect to air traffic control (ATC), weather observations, and airborne weather radar (AWR). RADAR is an incredibly useful tool to aviation, and is used in many forms, for multiple different jobs in civil aviation. For starters, it is split into primary and secondary radar. Primary radar is where a transceiver sends out electromagnetic pulses or waves that are reflected off items in the environment, back to the transceiver, and the time taken to travel to and from the object is measured, to give an indication of its range. The radar scans back and forth to figure out the direction of the object, and in doing so, gets a direction and distance, so can plot the location on a display. Secondary radar is where an interrogator sends out an interrogation signal, transponders pick this signal up, then send a reply signal, which is good as it can carry more information, such as squawk codes and altitudes, as used in SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar). ATC can use primary radar to track aircraft and weather, and use secondary radar also to track aircraft and gain extra information about an aircraft (SSR). Pilots can use primary radar to track weather and navigate (Airborne Weather Radar) as well as in the radio altimeter, and can use secondary radar to detect other aircraft for collision avoidance (ACAS/TCAS), as well as for DME (which is technically a secondary radar system, the aircraft is the interrogator).",

This is simply the direction the antenna is pointing when it receives the radar return. Therefore, the answer is \"the orientation of the antenna\". Radars work by sending out pulses of electromagnetic waves and timing when they get returns back that have reflect off certain objects. This allows them to calculate how far away the object is, and by spinning continuously and sending out a new pulse in each direction, they can work out where the object is in relation to the radar antenna, by both direction and distance. As for the other options: The pulse pair interval is set by the radar designer to choose the maximum range of the radar (how long does it wait for a return before sending the next pulse). The frequency shift of the received pulse can be used to calculate the speed of the object relative to the antenna (only towards or away from the antenna) due to doppler shift. This is used in some primary ground radar systems, but more often for pilots, we use this in airborne weather radars to spot areas of windshear. The time measurement is what allows the radar to work out how far away the object is, so is half of the data needed to plot the object's position (distance + direction).",

A pulse-coded interrogation message is sent from the ground to the aircraft. The transponder responds in accordance with the pulse-coded interrogation in the form of a pulse train that is a series of pulses, which carry the appropriate information. The transmissions are achieved in the UHF band where all ground interrogation pulses are processed at a 1 030 MHz carrier frequency and all transponder responses are completed on the 1 090 MHz carrier channel. The two main modes of operation (excluding Mode S) are: Mode A. An interrogation to identify an aircraft. Mode C. An interrogation to obtain an aumatic height read-out of an aircraft. Three pulses (P1, P2 and P3) are always transmitted to diferentiate between interrogations. The spacing between P1 and P2 is fixed at at 2 μs. The spacing between P1 and P3 is 8 μs for a Mode A and 21 μs for a Mode C interrogation. The transponder detects the time interval between the pulses P1 and P3 that determines the mode of interrogation.",

            "explanation": "Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear. Weather radars send directional pulses of microwave radiation, on the order of a microsecond long, using a cavity magnetron or klystron tube connected by a waveguide to a parabolic antenna. The wavelengths of 1 – 10 cm are approximately ten times the diameter of the droplets or ice particles of interest, because Rayleigh scattering occurs at these frequencies. This means that part of the energy of each pulse will bounce off these small particles, back in the direction of the radar station. Shorter wavelengths are useful for smaller particles, but the signal is more quickly attenuated. Thus 10 cm (S-band) radar is preferred but is more expensive than a 5 cm C-band system. 3 cm X-band radar is used only for short-range units, and 1 cm Ka-band weather radar is used only for research on small-particle phenomena such as drizzle and fog W band weather radar systems have seen limited university use, but due to quicker attenuation, most data are not operational. Radar pulses spread out as they move away from the radar station. Thus the volume of air that a radar pulse is traversing is larger for areas farther away from the station, and smaller for nearby areas, decreasing resolution at far distances. At the end of a 150 – 200 km sounding range, the volume of air scanned by a single pulse might be on the order of a cubic kilometer. This is called the pulse volume.",

Manual Tilt Management The tilt refers to the angle between the antenna beam centreline and the horizon. The flight crew should regularly scan the area ahead of the aircraft. In order to identify the strongest weather returns, the flight crew should tilt the weather radar antenna up and down. To obtain a correct display of a storm cell, the flight crew must use the tilt knob to point the weather radar beam to the most reflective part of the storm cell. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. We believe this is the point they want to get across in this question. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

            "explanation": "The radar can has two modes, weather and mapping. The weather beam is used for detecting clouds and is a conical pencil beam with a width of 5 degrees and the mapping is for ground features and uses a fan shaped or cosecant squared beam. The directional properties of the radar produce side lobes. One side lobe goes vertically down to the ground and is received back by the weather radar receiver. This received signal produces a height ring on the display. The ring indicates that the radar is working and appears at the approximate height of the aeroplane above the gound. An aeroplane flying at 12000ft will have a permanent return at approximately 2nm. Weather radars produce a wide fan shaped beam (cosecant square beam) by placing parasitic elements in front of the radar dish to deflect the beam. It is also referred to as the spoil beam. The Cosecant square beam provides a wider coverage than the conical beam at short range and its transmission pattern has the effect of compensating for range by sending more power to the top part of the beam which hits more distant objects. The cosec beam works out to between 60NM and 150NM (depending on type!! This is probably an old question that’s why the correct answer is “from 50NM to 60 NM” only). Beyond that range there is not enough power in the beam to produce reasonable returns so the more concentrated conical beam should be used instead in the weather mode. The radar display of ground returns does not always look like the terrain would look like on a map. Hills can cause \"shadowing\" at low altitude, masking the terrain behind them and giving a false impression of water. In arctic regions returns from ice can mask the true shape of the coastline.",

Radar modes: weather (WX) or weather + turbulence (WX + T). Source: safetyfirst.airbus.com/ The \"gain\" of a radar adjusts the sensitivity of the receiver. A high gain (high sensitivity) means that even very small reflected pulses will show up as returns on the radar screen, but this means that the radar screen can easily get too cluttered with very small returns that we do not want to see. A low gain will make the radar less sensitive, and so only large returns will actually show up on the display. Changing the gain also changes the sensitivity of the different colour bands, which is very useful. The gain can be changed in flight, for instance when looking at a cumulus cloud that does not look too violent, we might be happy to proceed through it if we know which bits are worst within it. With standard gain, the whole cloud might be green, but with the gain set a little higher, it may be possible to see the worst patches within it. The same goes for a thunderstorm that is huge and all red on the display, reducing the gain can give more detail about the weather within.",

The most turbulent areas of thunderstorms are also those areas that contain the most water and ice. Note that the areas in which the concentration of droplets decreases rapidly (which are marked on the radar screen by a sharp fall in signal intensity) are normally areas in which the most severe turbulence can be encountered. These are areas in which the strong up-going air currents are in close proximity to downward flowing currents and there is a strong risk of severe vertical wind shear. These areas will be identified on the radar screen by a rapid change in appearance of the cloud return - steep change in colors of the return (steep color gradient). If you identify this area on your radar screen, avoid that area! * Green: light precipitation, slight turbolence * Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation,light turbolence * Red: heavy precipitation, medium to severe turbolence * Magenta: Extremely high precipitation, severe turbolence So the weather radar is merely detecting the presence of water. It is the pilot interpreting the picture who is really detecting the turbulence. Clear air turbulence (CAT) does not have condensated water in it and is therefore undetectable by conventional radar. There are systems such as LIDAR that can detect CAT but they generally not installed on aircraft.",

The pilot may manually transmit a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse when the \"IDENT\" button on the pilot's transponder is pressed. By pushing the “IDENT” button, the transponder transmits an additional pulse at the end of the normal response pulse train. The benefit of the squawk \"IDENT\" function is a manual identification of the aircraft. The controller may ask via the radio communication frequency to \"IDENT\" in case of any doubt of identification on the controller display. Upon acquisition of the SPI pulse, the transponder indication changes/begins to flash on the controller's radar display for approximately 20 seconds. This produces a distinctive display so that a controller can pick out a particular aircraft by asking the pilot to “Squawk Ident”.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

It provides bearing and distance information of detected objects. The radar relies on reflected signals but is not aware if they are received from aircraft or from other objects (e.g. terrain, buildings, clouds). Such reflections are called clutter. Moving Target Indicator (MTI) technology is able to eliminate echoes from stationary objects such as terrain, buildings, etc. while leaving only relevant information displayed on the screen (aircraft). A target is therefore discriminated against clutter. MTI takes advantage of the Doppler effect: A moving target will be at different distance from the radar over a period of time. The reflection of radar pulses from a moving target will therefore occur at a varying distance with time - each successive pulse will be reflected from a different distance to the radar. The result will be a varying phase shift of the pulses due to a doppler effect. Stationary objects will reflect pulses at a constant phase shift.",

Manual Tilt Management The tilt refers to the angle between the antenna beam centreline and the horizon. The flight crew should regularly scan the area ahead of the aircraft. In order to identify the strongest weather returns, the flight crew should tilt the weather radar antenna up and down. To obtain a correct display of a storm cell, the flight crew must use the tilt knob to point the weather radar beam to the most reflective part of the storm cell. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. We believe this is the point they want to get across in this question. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

This is why we would set the tilt further downwards after making such a climb. It is important to remember that there are other questions asking about the tilt setting during take-off and climb out. Well of course, the setting at that time of flight would be quite high, to see the weather the aircraft is climbing towards and avoid clutter from ground returns. After that, though, the tilt setting should gradually be reduced until the cruise, and then in the descent, gradually increased again to avoid ground returns. Remember also that the radar is automatically stabilised so it follows the horizon plus/minus any tilt, not the aircraft attitude plus/minus tilt.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! RADAR is an incredibly useful tool to aviation, and is used in many forms, for multiple different jobs in civil aviation. For starters, it is split into primary and secondary radar. Primary radar is where a transceiver sends out electromagnetic pulses or waves that are reflected off items in the environment, back to the transceiver, and the time taken to travel to and from the object is measured, to give an indication of its range. The radar scans back and forth to figure out the direction of the object, and in doing so, gets a direction and distance, so can plot the location on a display. Secondary radar is where an interrogator sends out an interrogation signal, transponders pick this signal up, then send a reply signal, which is good as it can carry more information, such as squawk codes and altitudes, as used in SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar). Aircraft are fitted with a primary radar to track weather and navigate (Airborne Weather Radar) as well as in the radio altimeter, and can use secondary radar to detect other aircraft for collision avoidance (ACAS/TCAS), as well as for DME (which is technically a secondary radar system, the aircraft is the interrogator). For this question, we are just talking about primary radar, so TCAS and SSR are not correct options, and the only correct option is weather radar, which is a common item to have on board a commercial aircraft. Radio altimeters are also primary radars fitted to an aircraft, but none of the options correspond to that. Weather radars can also show terrain nearby in a way, but this is not their primary purpose at all, and is very rarely used these days.",

Therefore, SSR systems have a greater range than PSR systems, on the order of 250+ NM from the radar site. In addition, unlike PSR, which relies on reflected pulses, SSR's operation is not affected by ground interference due to its unique transmission and reception methods. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder.",

AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR An airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. AWR detects drops of precipitation such as rain and wet hail. At high altitude, a storm cell may contain ice particles that have low reflectivity. If the tilt setting is not correct, the ND may display only the upper (less reflective) part of the storm cell (over scanning). As a result, the flight crew may underestimate or not detect a storm cell at all. The pilot would normally keep the tilt at 0º to 0.5º down during high altitude cruise. However, if there is a thunderstorm in front, the pilot would want to turn the tilt down (significantly, about 5º down) to see where the worst part of the storm is and how severe the core of the storm is. Use of the Weather Radar in Accordance with the Flight Phase Flight Phase Tilt Control Taxi Away from ground personnel, set the ND to the lowest range – as a rule, set 15º up. Take-Off In the case of suspected adverse weather conditions, manually and gradually tilt up to scan weather (maximum 15º up). In all other cases, set the tilt to 4º up. Climb Adjust the ND range as required and decrease the tilt angle as the aircraft climbs. Generally, set the tilt 5º to 7º up initially, possibly steadily reducing with altitude. Level flight/Cruise Adjust the ND range as required. Regularly modify the tilt to scan weather ahead of the aircraft. When the weather scan is completed, adjust the tilt so that the ground returns appear on the top of the ND. At high altitude, tilt is set to 0º to 0.5º, except under adverse weather conditions. Descent Set the tilt to about 5º up. Approach Set the tilt to 4º up – which prevents the display of too many ground returns.",

It refers to a system which emits pulses of electromagnetic energy, then waits for any of those pulses to return, and if/when they do, it measures the time between emitting the pulse and receiving the reflected pulse, which it can then use to calculate the distance from the target, as the electromagnetic waves all travel at the speed of light. It does this whilst scanning the sky from side to side, so each pulse targets a different area of the sky horizontally, and by sending pulses many hundreds of times per second, the radar can scan the region and get both a bearing and a distance to each target. This can then be plotted on a display for the radar operator to see. With primary radar, you can therefore only see locations of targets, and can extrapolate their movements over time to get a rough idea of their speed, if the operator is skilled. Other radar systems can provide more information than this (SSR - Secondary Surveillance Radar), which use a different method of radar operation",

When these pulses encounter an aircraft or object, some of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. The PSR uses a polar coordinate system to provide information on the detected targets. It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING The measurement of bearing is achieved using the searchlight principle. This involves concentrating radio pulses into narrow beams, which can be accomplished by either shortening the wavelength or increasing the size of the aerial (in advanced systems, this is done electronically). The narrow beam is then rotated at a constant speed. When an echo is received, the direction of the object is determined based on the direction of the beam at the time of receiving the echo. This direction is measured from a fixed reference point or datum. Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

PRF is one of the main factors that determine the maximum theoretical unambiguous range of a pulse radar. The trasmitter must remain “silent” while the receiver is “listening” for echoes. If the design maximum range is 200NM the receiver must be allowed to “listen” for the period of time fro when a pulse has been trasmitted untill it can go to 200NM and than return. That is a round trip of 400 NM, which would require a longer “silent period” than a radar whit a range of 100NM where the pulses have to travel only 200NM. Therefore we can say that a lower PRF enables a longer maximum theoretical range: max therorical range is inversly proportional to the PRF. The following formula may be used to calculate the max theoretical unambiguous range : Range (in Km) = 300 000 ÷ ( PRF x 2 ), or if we need to find the required PRF based on a specific unambiguous range needed, we can rearrange the formula: PRF = 300 000 ÷ ( Range (in Km) x 2)",

Thunderstorms can produce airframe-shattering turbulence, damaging hail, sudden and dramatic wind shear, strong, gusty winds—sometimes as much as 20 miles from the edge of a cell. Never regard any thunderstorm lightly. According to ICAO AC 120-88A Appendix 1: AVOID any convective activity (CBs) en route by at least 20 nautical miles. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. Generally speaking, you'll find the best chance for clear, smooth air on the upwind side of a thunderstorm. Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear.

The wetter and larger the precipitation, the better the reflectivity, the stronger the returns. Wet hail gives the best returns, whereas ice crystals and dry snow do not give good radar returns. Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self stabilising at a chosen attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch/roll changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high in the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and high again during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display. On modern aircraft, there is often an auto tilt setting that is used to relieve pilot workload, but can be overriden for manual tasks. In this question, the best feature is the ability to scan other levels for more/less precipitation, potentially to choose a better level to penetrate precipitation at. It would not be useful to scan clear air above a developing thunderstorm as the CB cloud will continue rising, so this data becomes useless very quickly.",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) : a surveillance radar system which uses reflected radio signals. Source: ICAO Doc 4444 PANS-ATM Principle of operation: The radar antenna rotates (usually at 5-12 rpm) emits a pulse of radio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the antenna. The PSR output data uses polar coordinate system: it provides range and bearing of the targets found in respect of the antenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from the antenna and not the horizontal distance. The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse (the speed of propagation is the speed of light) and the bearing is obtained from the antenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the antenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. The antenna radiation patern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, whith some approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. The advantage of Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) is that it operates totally independently of the target aircraft (no action from the aircraft is required for it to provide a radar return). The disadvantages of PSR are that, firstly, enormous amounts of power must be radiated to ensure returns from the target. This is especially true if long range is desired. Secondly, because of the small amount of energy returned at the receiver, returns may be easily disrupted due to such factors as changes of target attitude or signal attenuation due to heavy rain. This may cause the displayed target to 'fade'. Thirdly, correlation of a particular radar return with a particular aircraft requires an identification process. When PSR was the only type of radar available, this was typically achieved by the Controller instructing an aircraft to turn and observing same on their display, or by correlating a DME distance report by the aircraft with the position of a particular return along a known track. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) requires an airborne transponder which responds to the receipt of a pulse from a ground-based antenna by transmitting a return signal. Because the transponder transmits a much stronger signal than that which is reflected off an aircraft in primary radar systems, greater range and reliability can be achieved with secondary radar and cheaper and more efficient ground equipment can be used. Additionally, information such as altitude and a code can be added to the returned signal from the transponder which is then displayed on the operator’s screen. The great advantages of SSR are three: firstly, because the reply signal is transmitted from the aircraft it is much stronger when received at the ground station, thus giving the possibility of much greater range and reducing the problems of signal attenuation; similarly, the transmitting power required of the ground station for a given range is much reduced, thus providing considerable economy; and thirdly, because the signals in each direction are electronically coded the possibility is offered to transmit additional information between the two stations. The disadvantage of SSR is that it requires a target aircraft to carry an operating transponder. Thus SSR is a 'dependant' surveillance system. For this reason, PSR will operate in conjunction with SSR in certain areas for the foreseeable future so that 'non-cooperating' targets, such as some light aircraft, can be detected. SSR has several modes of operation, the basic civil mode being Mode A. In this mode the aircraft's transponder provides positive aircraft identification by transmitting a four-digit code to the ground station. The code system is octal; that is, each of the code digits may be any of the numbers 0-7. There are thus 4096 possible four-digit codes. Another principal SSR mode currently used is Mode C. In this mode the aircraft's altitude, derived from on-board instruments, is transmitted to the ground station in addition to the identity. The use of Mode C was introduced in Australia in the late 1980s with the acquisition of ground systems, such as ATCARDS, capable of processing the information. A further mode, Mode S (or 'Mode Select'), is also used. Aircraft equipped with transponders supporting this mode are assigned a permanent identification which can be selectively addressed by the ground radar. This reduces problems of garbling between SSR returns from aircraft in close proximity. Mode S also offers a wider range of data to be transmitted, including potentially an uplink of data from the ground station to the aircraft.",

Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) work by transmitting microwave pulses forwards from the aircraft, in a standard sweeping radar pattern, then waiting for any reflected pulses to return, measuring the time taken to return, and plotting the position of the reflector (raindrops, hail, suspended water in a cloud of all types - some better reflectors than others) on the screen. The amount of returns from a particular area dictates the colour of the return on the screen. This is an excellent system, but can sometimes have an issue called shadowing, where a large number of hailstones or water droplets can reflect back all of the pulses sent out, not allowing any of the pulses to get through to potential weather behind them. This creates a false shadow on the display, and the pilots may believe that the weather is better there, when in fact, there is no way of knowing what weather is there without going around the first large return. Here we can see that the very intense cell above aerodrome A is blocking the vast majority of returns in a corridor of shadow behind it. Therefore, Aerodrome B's precipitation is unknown. Aerodrome C, however, is not shadowed by a huge cell, and the low intensity green cell in front of it is not enough to block the majority of the pulses, so therefore the radar image at C is correct, little to no precipitation.",

Learning Objective 062.03.03.06.04: Explain how wind shear can be detected by a modern weather radar. This question has to be very specific in order for it not to have 2 correct answers. The fact that it says \"modern aircraft\" certainly means that they are referring to the learning objectives above. These refer to the turbulence and wind shear detection capabilities of modern airborne weather radars (AWRs), not the precipitation detection which has been around for over 70 years. Between windshear detection and turbulence detection, they are almost the same process, but windshear detection involves input from the Air Data Computer (ADC), via the GPWS system to produce windshear alerting (and it is not an available answer option). Therefore the correct answer can only be turbulence detection. We look ahead using our AWR to check our planned routing, and occasionally choose a better one. Turbulence can be detected by modern AWRs, as the movement of the precipitation within the cloud causes a doppler shift on the returning radar pulses, so the radar can form an idea of the air movement patterns in that area. If they are erratic, then turbulence exists in that region. This cannot detect CAT (clear air turbulence), as that has no associated radar returns, as it is invisible by definition.",

There is also a much larger ability for transfer of information through mode S, with many different aircraft parameters able to be transferred to the ground through ELS (elementary surveillance) or EHS (enhanced surveillance) systems, and even a capacity of communications via datalink. Mode S transponders use the same frequencies as Mode A/C transponders, so are backwards compatible, and the SSR ground station produces different interrogation pulses to require different responses from the transponders in the area. For example, the interrogation station can send out Mode A/C only \"All Calls\", with a short fourth pulse (P4), which means nothing to the older Mode A/C transponders (they will reply normally), but means that the mode S transponders will reply with only their mode A/C information. This backwards compatibility means that theoretically, the interrogation signal could ask for mode A responses only, so the transponder (even though it is fully mode S capable) will just respond with its 4 digit squawk code.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

Transponders in mode A can only provide response including the aircraft identification (4-digit transponder / squawk code). Transponders in mode C, in addition to the identification, can also provide an altitude information in the response. Transponders in mode S can provide all of this information and multitude of additional data, such as: • Callsign • Specific aircraft identification / registration address • Altitude information in 25 ft increments (as opposed to 100 ft increments for mode C) • Datalink information, allowing exchange of ATC and flight operations related info between the ATC and the aircraft.

Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) is the number of occurrences (pulses) each second. The PRF has a large significance on maximum range. Depending on how far the radar wishes to search for objects and what the visible range is, the Pulse Repetition interval has to be set in a way to always allow the pulse to reach the range limits and return, before the next pulse is sent. The maximum theoretical unambiguous range is calculate by the formula: Range [km] = 300 000 ÷ (PRF × 2) In the above formula, the range is given in kilometres and the PRF is in pps. The formula includes \"300 000\" which represents the number of km the light travels every second (speed of light). The minimum detection range of a pulse radar is determined primarily by the pulse length/width. Longer pulses are better for long range detection, as there is more energy available to be reflected, similar to using a higher power radar, but with very slightly less accuracy on the exact distance. The problem is that longer pulses do not allow short range radar reflections, as the pulse is still being emitted whilst the first reflections are returning. This is why we cannot have the best of both worlds, long maximum range and short minimum range, and compromises have to be made. Therefore, a lower PRF (longer gap between pulses) means longer maximum range. A lower Pulse Length allows for shorter minimum range.",

Why the question has been written in the first place is confusing, as the question is lacking information about the exact issue, and we should not need to understand cathode ray tubes as part of the syllabus. A cathode ray tube is an old style of visual display, commonly seen in old TVs (before flat screens), with large boxes behind the screen. It was very common to have CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays in older aircraft whenever a screen was required in the flight deck. They are heavy, draw quite a lot of power, and break easily. They operate by firing electrons through the tube and using electromagnets to bend the electrons either up or down to a point on the screen. When the electrons hit the photoluminescent coating at the end of the tube, it lights up, and by scanning a beam backwards and forwards along a horizontal line very quickly, this forms an image, which can even be made in colour. If there is just a bright line on the screen, it likely means that the electromagnetic coils in the CRT display are broken, or that the electron beam scanner does not work (depending on whether the line is vertical or horizontal), and all the electrons are ending up in a single line. The other options here to do with broken weather radar equipment would at least show the usual information on the screen (range of scan, tilt setting, etc.). Possibly, a vertical line could show up if the scanner was not rotating and many returns were being picked up from directly ahead, but the question seemed to say that the line was the only thing on the screen, which would not seem right if everything was working except the rotation. The feedback also indicated that a faulty cathode ray tube was the correct answer. Again, this should be appealed, it is ridiculous.",

The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. => Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water. In some modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence. => This function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.03.03.06.01: Describe the navigation function of the radar in the mapping mode. There are two possible answers for this question. However, the option \"By selecting a suitable echo from the display, obtaining the relative bearing and distance, and converting it into a true bearing to plot on the chart.\" has been confirmed by feedback to be correct in official exams. The pilot may take a relative bearing from an AWR display and would then use the aircraft heading to turn the relative heading into a magnetic or true bearing to. Thereafter, the reciprocal from the ground feature can be back-plotted as true or magnetic. On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

CAL – rotate to the CAL position for automatic gain control. The CAL position results in a calibrated map or weather radar display. Gain control does not affect turbulence or windshear. Manual – rotating the knob out of CAL varies gain between MIN and MAX. VAR is shown on the display, indicating that the gain has been changed from the calibrated position. MIN – position reduces gain approximately 16 dBz below the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward min reduces precipitation intensity thresholds, requiring greater intensity precipitation levels to display in red. MAX – position increases gain 10 dBz over the CAL setting. Rotating the selector toward MAX increases precipitation intensity thresholds allowing lesser intensity precipitation levels to display in red. Max gain should only be used at cruise altitudes to help see less reflective frozen storm tops. (Increasing the GAIN, increases the sensitivity of the receiver.)",

            "explanation": "Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR): Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) operates by emitting radio wave pulses from a rotating antenna. When these pulses encounter an aircraft or object, some of the energy is reflected back to the antenna. The PSR uses a polar coordinate system to provide information on the detected targets. It calculates the range, which is the slant distance from the antenna to the target, and the bearing, which is determined by the antenna's azimuth. RANGE The range is determined by comparing the time it takes for the pulse to be emitted and received, utilizing the speed of light as the propagation speed. It's important to note that the range provided is not the horizontal distance, but the slant distance from the antenna to the target. BEARING Bearing measurement in radar systems utilizes the searchlight principle, where radio pulses are focused into narrow beams. This can be achieved by reducing the wavelength or electronically enlarging the antenna in advanced systems. The narrow beam is then rotated at a consistent speed. By analyzing the direction of the received echo, the bearing of the object can be determined based on the azimuth of the antenna at the time of receiving the echo. This directional information is measured from a fixed reference point or datum Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) calculates bearing (antenna's azimuth) and range (time difference) of a target providing a two-dimensional position.",

Unlike a Primary Radar System, which sends out pulses and then waits for any of those pulses to be reflected off an item such as an aircraft, a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) sends out pulses, which are interrogations of aircraft SSR transponders. The interrogation is sent out of frequency 1030 MHz, and the aircraft transponder then emits its own string of reply pulses on 1090 MHz, a different frequency. This method of radar usage has many benefits, as the signals only need to be a quarter as powerful to travel half the distance, primary radar signals have to travel to and object and then return to the station, whereas with SSR, the reply signals are freshly produced by the aircraft transponder, so cover the air to ground journey, reducing the required power of the Radar. SSR also has the benefits of being able to transmit a series of encoded pulses, giving a 4 digit transponder squawk code of an aircraft in mode A operation, and a pressure altitude readout when also using mode C. More data can be sent out by mode S also, and this is all encoded into strings of reply pulses emitted by the aircraft transponder. SSR positively identifies an aircraft’s primary response by displaying its code and call sign alongside.",

When in Autotilt mode, the radar uses the EGPWS terrain database and automatically adjusts the antenna tilt based on the aircraft position, altitude, and the selected ND range (fig.6). The next generation of radars (fully automatic radars) optimize weather detection and decrease significantly the pilots’ workload necessary to understand the complete picture of the weather ahead. They included automatic functions, which: Scan airspace ahead of the aircraft with multiple beams Feature a three dimensional (3D) buffer to store weather data Automatically compute and adjust the antenna tilt Offer independent pilot control and display selection. This kind of radars automatically adjusts the gain and tilt based on various parameters (aircraft altitude, geographical area, season, time of the day) to obtain the best weather display in each geographic region.",

            "explanation": "In SSR Mode S, transponders in aircraft are selectively interrogated by sensors (SSR ground stations) to perform ranging and bearing as well as to provide enhanced situational awareness with the exchange of binary-encoded surveillance information. Information from Mode S transponders can be received from SSR ground stations which have the capability to interrogate a Mode S transponder. TCAS systems also rely on the the Mode S data link to detect collision hazards and exchange resolution advisories among each other. In ADS-B, the new standard that has become mandatory in most airspaces by 2020, Mode S transponders elicit the periodic or event-driven transmission of extended squitters (ADS-B messages) in order to provide position, velocity and identity reports to aircraft and ground stations in range. Important note: We have received multiple feedback supporting the option \"SSR and ADS-B\". However, latest feedback (Feb-22) states that the current correct option is \"SSR and TCAS\", which possibly indicates that this question has been recently updated by EASA. Please, let us know if you come across this question.",

Stronger returns show up in red, whereas weaker returns are green, and yellow returns in the middle. (Sometimes magenta is used to show areas of turbulence.) The AWR is self-stabilising at a particular attitude, using the IRS attitude system. It therefore does not respond to aircraft pitch changes, and can be set at a range of desired vertical tilt angles, depending on what the crew want to detect. The tilt settings are usually set high at take-off and the beginning of the climb, to detect weather that is about to be climbed into, then reduced during the climb, to spot the more violent cores of weather (such as developing thunderstorms) that could affect the aircraft. It should be kept low in the cruise, to detect the main cores of weather around, and raised gradually during the descent, to reduce the amount of ground returns that show up on the display.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate GNSS corrections over a wide-area. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches, to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft. To tune into a GNSS approach with SBAS augmentation, a 5-digit channel is entered into the guidance system, which then accesses the correct information to augment the GNSS signal as required. This 5-digit code will be given on any relevant approach plate, along with the SBAS that is to be used, such as EGNOS for Europe.",

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas.

Because the PRN sequence is generated by the on-board clock, the precise start time of each sequence is known and can be transmitted along with the sequence. The GPS receiver compares and matches these codes with the corresponding PRN codes stored in its memory. This comparison reveals the satellite's identity and the time when it transmitted the signal. By aligning the received signal with the reproduced signal, the receiver calculates a time of arrival (TOA), representing the measured time elapsed between signal transmission and reception from the satellite.

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors through the many ground stations and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections, and detect any errors with the GNSS signals as soon as they occur. Whilst the answers do contain multiple correct statements, the one that we believe most applies to the question (integrity alerting within 6 seconds) is the answer mentioning just the one required geostationary satellite, as only one SBAS satellite is required to relay the loss-of-integrity alert message from the master station to the aircraft (although EGNOS does indeed have up to 4 geostationary satellites). It does appear that some feedback (particularly from the Polish ULC) states that the answer mentioning 4 satellites is the correct answer under that authority. Note: this question has multiple answers that are correct, and we have had to use the most recent feedback to choose the correct answer in our database. Any further feedback on this question would be very useful.",

The basic GPS service provides users with approximately 7.8 meter accuracy, 95% of the time, anywhere on or near the surface of the earth. To accomplish this, each satellite emits signals to receivers that determine their location by computing the difference between the time that a signal is sent and the time it is received travelling at 300,000 km/sec. The receiver uses the time difference between the time of signal reception and the broadcast time to compute the distance, or range, from the receiver to the satellite. With information about the ranges to 3 satellites and the location of the satellite when the signal was sent, the receiver can compute its own three-dimensional position. Pay attention: the clock on the GPS receiver might not be as accurate as the atomic clock on the GPS satellite, creating a very slight accuracy problem (clock error). GPS satellites broadcast two codes the coarse/acquisition (C/A) code which is unique to the satellite and the navigation data message. The codes contain information the receiver needs to determine latitude, longitude and altitude, and to synchronise its quartz clock with GPS time used through the GPS system. Current approvals for the use of GPS equipment in IFR operations require GPS-derived data to be in the WGS-84 coordinate system, or worldwide geodetic datum standard 84. Summary: using range from 3 satellites accurate 2D position fix is obtained ( Lat, Long, Time) using range from 4 satellites accurate 3D position fix is obtained ( Lat, Long, Altitude, Time)",

This can allow our aircraft to notice any suspicious GNSS position data and notify the pilots that it may not be correct. RAIM is a system which uses extra GNSS satellites to effectively verify the working order of the usual 4 required for a 3D position fix. 1 extra satellite (5 in total) can give the ability to notice when a fault occurs (Fault Detection). 2 extra satellites (6 in total) gives the ability to detect and identify which satellite is faulty (Fault Detection and Exclusion). This can have the issue (as in this question) of not enough satellite coverage, hence requiring another system to provide the integrity monitoring. GBAS (Ground Based Augmentation System) can provide integrity monitoring, but the airport has to be fully equipped with a GBAS system (which is still quite rare), the aircraft must be correctly equipped, and it only reaches out to approximately 30 km, which would not be suitable for the arrival phase of flight.

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, which receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate corrections to each GNSS satellite's pseudo-range. These corrections can then be used to refine GNSS measurements over huge areas, via the geostationary satellites above those areas. Geostationary Satellites are those that orbit exactly once every day, meaning that they stay over the same point on Earth. To do this they also have to be over the equator. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches (and massively increase integrity monitoring), to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

When the satellites are close together in the view of the GPS receiver antenna, the angles at which the position surfaces intersect become less favorable.

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS works by placing a few GNSS receivers around an aerodrome, each with an exact known location. The receivers then compare their uncorrected GNSS position with their actual position to work out the GNSS error in that location. That is the calculate into pseudorange corrections for each individual satellite, and broadcast to aircraft within 30 nm via the VHF data broadcast. To be clear, the satellites do not know this is happening, and do not care either; the GBAS just helps the aircraft augment its final position calculation slightly. because of this very localised correction, GBAS can make position accuracy extremely accurate, often much below 1 m accuracy.",

There are multiple different GNSSs, firstly created by the USA in the form of NAVSTAR/GPS (everyone knows this as GPS, and it is widely used). Then the USSR developed GLONASS, followed by more recently (and partly still in production), Europe's \"Galileo\" system and China's \"Beidou\" system. The other items listed in the questions are satellite based augmentation systems, which improve GNSS accuracy and integrity, but are not part of the GNSS systems themselves.

The technique is called Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) and it does not use external systems.

RAIM algorithms require a minimum of five visible satellites in order to perform Fault Detection (FD) and detect the presence of an unacceptably large position error for a given mode of flight. RAIM can maintain an accurate 3D fix by monitoring 5 satellites even if satellite signals become temporarily erroneous. When one satellite is excluded, the RAIM function is lost but accurate GNSS position is maintained. Newer GPS receivers incorporate Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) uses a minimum of six satellites not only to detect a faulty satellite but also to exclude it from the navigation solution so that the navigation function can continue without interruption.",

These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas and interpreted by a ground station, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. Errors in the receiver, multipath signals, and some small atmospheric propagation errors can still occur, but the intention is to get the accuracy below 1m for aircraft on final approach. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The GBAS positioning service is a terminal version of GBAS which exists around GBAS capable airports, and is useful for high accuracy navigation and fast integrity monitoring in the terminal areas close ot the airports.",

From our own knowledge on this, the two systems can be used together, but there is some \"translation\" that has to occur to make them interoperable. For instance, if you've used a non-aviation Garmin device before, you might have seen that you can choose to use GPS only or GPS + GLONASS. One of the problems is that they use different reference systems, GPS uses WGS-84 and GLONASS uses PZ-90. Theoretically, using them both side-by side and mathematically converting the final product between the reference systems seems like the best way to use them at the moment. So we think that they are somewhat interoperable currently, but we do not know if they are actually truly interoperable yet, such as one system that uses both signals in the same way (we know that something similar to that is the goal, from the learning objectives and various EASA documentation), so we think that perhaps an examiner may have jumped the gun a little and written a question that is ahead of its time. Note: We would also like some further information on why option B, \"are two separate systems and only GPS is covered by EU regulations so only that service can be used by European Operators.\" is wrong. Currently, we know that only GPS is used in European airspace, and they are separate systems, so we do not see what the problem is with this answer, other than the \"correct\" answer (from feedback) being more in line with the learning objectives. Perhaps the examiner is not talking about flying in Europe, but that seems also misleading.",

            "explanation": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) are navigational systems that employ the use of many satellites orbiting the Earth (24 is a technical minimum). Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times (trilateration), every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals. It will surprise nobody that this was initially created for military use, and therefore there are some differences between the civilian and military versions of GPS (which was the first GNSS system, created by the US military). Two different frequencies actually exist for use by GPS, L1 transmits on a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, transmitting both a P (precision) and a C/A (Course Acquisition) codes. L2 transmits on a frequency of 1227.6 MHz, transmitting only a P code. SPS (the Standard Positioning Service) is available to all receivers, and uses the L1 carrier wave only, whereas PPS (the Precision Positioning Service) is available to authorised users (the military), using both the L1 and the L2 carrier waves. The use of 2 separate carrier waves (on 2 separate frequencies) is very useful, as the 2 different waves will be affectedly differently by ionospheric propagation effects as they travel through the atmosphere (which is a large source of GNSS error), and the difference between the two waves can used to extrapolate a very accurate range sphere from the satellite, causing very accurate positioning from the GNSS system by almost completely removing one of the largest errors, ionospheric propagation. This is not something that the SPS can do, using only the signal on L1 frequency, there is no opportunity for signal comparison, so the receivers use a standard model of ionospheric propagation, which can correct for ionospheric errors somewhat, but is not as precise as having two signals to compare. Note: This is quite old technology now, and civilians have access to other frequencies also these days such as L2C and L5, not just L1. EASA, however, only recognise this old system, described above, which is useful for us as the modern usage is far more complex to understand.",

LNAV/VNAV uses GNSS plus a barometric VNAV (or SBAS) system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower, as low as 200ft (ILS CAT I) due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - is gained by using SBAS augmentation to the GNSS signal, it is also a 3D approach standard with vertical guidance. SBAS CAT I approaches are precision approaches according to the more recent documents from ICAO. We are currently unsure as whether the examiners have caught up with these changes, so be on the lookout for the older questions which refer to LPV approaches as APV (Approach with Vertical Guidance). Classification into precision and non-precision approaches is no longer operationally useful in the current age, instead it is better to use 2D and 3D SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) operations use an extra geostationary satellite and a wide network of ground antennas with a master station to calculate the signal errors of GNSS location data, then apply a correction depending on the user's location to reduce measurable GNSS errors to a very small error margin. They also increase integrity monitoring so an alert of any unsuitability is issued within 6 seconds. Commonly confused is the GBAS Landing system (GLS), which is actually not a form of RNP APCH, and is a separate type of precision approach, that just happens to use ground based augmentation on GNSS signals, a localised version of SBAS.",

            "explanation": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error. In this question, the dilution of precision is the largest factor in accuracy reduction, as tropospheric propagation is usually a small effect, and not mentioned in the LOs. Also, receiver clock error is usually removed by the iterative process of resetting the receiver clock during stellite acquisition.",

This can tell us within a few seconds if a satellite that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) and there is a further feature called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) if another extra satellite is available. RAIM prediction is used to find out whether the current satellites in the constellation are expected to be plentiful enough to provide RAIM at a particular place and time. The prediction software has orbital data which it can use to calculate the RAIM availability for the expected approach time at the destination, for example. If the RAIM prediction shows an error or negative message, this will be most likely due to insufficient satellites within line of sight of the position at the expected time, meaning there is unlikely to be enough satellites to provide this type of integrity monitoring.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objectives Reference 062.06.01.03.04: State that ionospheric delay is the most significant error. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric and Tropospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay causes the most significant position error. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. Consequently, both ionospheric errors and satellite clock errors induce position inaccuracies, but ionospheric delay creates the most significant NAVSTAR GPS position error.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, which receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate corrections to each GNSS satellite's pseudo-range. These corrections can then be used to refine GNSS measurements over huge areas, via the geostationary satellites above those areas. Geostationary Satellites are those that orbit exactly once every day, meaning that they stay over the same point on Earth. To do this they also have to be over the equator. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches (and massively increase integrity monitoring), to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.07: State that errors in the satellite orbits are due to: solar winds; gravitation of the Sun and the Moon. The sum of errors that the slightly incorrect pseudo-ranges bring to the position error is called the User Range Error (URE), and then when the receiver errors are added onto the URE, the User Equivalent Range Error (EURE) is given. The only main GNSS error that is not included in the EURE is geometric dilution of precision error. See the details highlighted in the full explanation below. FULL EXPLANATION Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. Multiple pseudoranges allow a process called trilateration to give a receiver its location. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Multipath error Receiver quality Dilution Of Precision (DOP) *Errors in Bold above are part of the URE (User Range Error) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. The navigation message includes ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. The almanac also gives the rough expected positions of the satellites in the future. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas, then interpreted and distributed by a ground station via a VDB antenna, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. There are still some errors that cannot be accounted for, but these are small. GBAS also provides integrity information about the GNSS satellites. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The VHF datalink (called the VDB) sends a signal that corrects the GNSS position, so that the onboard navigation system can guide the aircraft accurately on the approach, in both azimuth and glidepath. Note: For this question, the examiner is mostly asking \"what signals are sent in the VHF data broadcast?\". The correct answer is \"correction data\", as this is exactly what the GBAS system does, it corrects the GNSS position. The GBAS system does not send glidepath and azimuth data to the aircraft, like an ILS or MLS would. This is the primary objective of this question. The GBAS ground station does not tell the aircraft that it is 2 m right and 4 ft above the correct position, it tells it to adjust its GNSS position by a certain amount, then the aircraft makes sure it follows the approach correctly. It also does not matter whether the VDB antenna is classed as part of the ground station or not, that is not the defining difference in this question. The ground station transmits VDB signals via the antenna to the aircraft, which still means that the ground station sends signals to the aircraft.",

RAIM is a technique by which a receiver checks the reliability of the signals it is receiving and can detect if one of the signals is incorrect. It monitors more than 4 satellites in view and excludes the one providing an inaccurate signal when necessary. With this technique, RAIM can maintain an accurate 3D fix by monitoring 5 satellites even if satellite signals become temporarily erroneous.

This can tell us within a few seconds if a satellite that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). The amount of required satellites can be reduced by 1 for 2D fixes, but these are uncommon, unless barometric altitude is fed to the GNSS system, which can allow an extra \"range sphere\", and effectively acts like another satellite. This is an Air-Based Augmentation System and occurs in a different place in the learning objectives.

It will surprise nobody that this was initially created for military use, and therefore there are some differences between the civilian and military versions of GPS (which was the first GNSS system, created by the US military). Two different frequencies actually exist for use by GPS, L1 transmits on a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, transmitting both a P (precision) and a C/A (Course Acquisition) codes. L2 transmits on a frequency of 1227.6 MHz, transmitting only a P code. SPS (the Standard Positioning Service) is available to all receivers, and uses the L1 carrier wave only; whereas PPS (the Precision Positioning Service) is available to authorised users (the military), using both the L1 and the L2 carrier waves. The use of 2 separate carrier waves (on 2 separate frequencies) is very helpful, as the 2 different waves will be affectedly differently by ionospheric propagation effects as they travel through the atmosphere (which is a large source of GNSS error), and the difference between the two waves can used to extrapolate a very accurate range sphere from the satellite, causing very accurate positioning from the GNSS system by almost completely removing one of the largest errors, ionospheric propagation. This is not something that the SPS can do, using only the signal on L1 frequency, there is no opportunity for signal comparison, so the receivers use a standard model of ionospheric propagation, which can correct for ionospheric errors somewhat, but is not as precise as having two signals to compare. Note: This is quite old technology now, and civilians have access to other frequencies also these days such as L2C and L5, not just L1. EASA, however, only recognise this old system, described above, which is actually very useful for us as the modern usage is far more complex to understand.",

            "explanation": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a 10 ns timing error might imply a 3m pseudorange error. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric and Tropospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 75 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors are caused by temperature, density, pressure or humidity changes. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building ( The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error.",

Learning Objective 062.06.01.02.25: State that the different GNSSs use different data with respect to reference systems, orbital data, and navigation services. GPS and GLONASS are both GNSS systems, so operate in pretty much the same way, by using timed signals from satellites at known locations to work out multiple distance spheres, and thereby allow a receiver to work out its location. For aviation purposes, GPS is usually used in Europe and the Americas, but GLONASS is mostly used by Russia and their allies. They both operate over the whole world as they are global navigation systems, and they are NOT compatible with each other, neither by acting as extra satellites for the other, nor by augmenting the signals of the other like SBAS might. From our own knowledge on this, the two systems can actually be used together, but they will not \"work together\". There is some \"translation\" that has to occur to make them interoperable. For instance, if you've used a non-aviation Garmin device before, you might have seen that you can choose to use GPS only or GPS + GLONASS. One of the problems is that they use different reference systems, GPS uses WGS-84 and GLONASS uses PZ-90. Theoretically, using them both side-by side and mathematically converting the final product between the reference systems seems like the best way to use them both together at the moment, but this is not an aviation application of the two technologies yet, as far as we can tell.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, detected by a network of ground antennas, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. This can bring the time of a loss of integrity alert from a potential 3 hours down to just 6 seconds. This is far more acceptable for precision approaches, etc. Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites; on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite.",

The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudo-range or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudo-range’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it difficult to predict the exact induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Within the NAV message of standard GPS, one of the pieces of data that is downloaded to the receiver is a ionospheric model, based on an 11 year solar cycle, which can help the receiver drastically reduce the ionospheric error that affects the position fix.",

            "explanation": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) are navigational systems that employ the use of many satellites orbiting the Earth (24 is a technical minimum). Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnet messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals. There are multiple different GNSS systems in use around the world, NAVSTAR/GPS was initially created by the US, followed by GLONASS by the USSR/Russia, and now Galileo for Europe, and Beidou for China. They all have variations on each other, but use the same basic principle described above. It will be no surprise to anyone that these systems were initially designed for military use, and then released to the general public for (albeit less accurate) global usage. For Instance, GPS and Galileo use the WGS-84 ellispsoid reference system for position referencing, whereas GLONASS uses PZ-90.",

Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. EGNOS is Europe's SBAS, and it contains up to 4 geo-stationary satellites (but deactivated one in 2019 so are running with 3 at the moment; 2 active, 1 in testing mode). These provide SBAS to Europe, and have the capability to provide it to Africa and the Middle East as well. Only 1 satellite is required to provide full coverage, hence the 2 active satellites in case of failure. Due to the other options here, it is best to go through the answers one by one: \"EGNOS uses at least 1 geostationary satellite to transmit to aircraft integrity and safety related messages.\" Yes, only 1 satellite is required, that section is correct. However, they don't transmit safety related messages other than integrity messages, therefore we would argue this is not completely correct. \"EGNOS uses up to 2 geostationary satellites to transmit ranging signals in the L2 frequency.\" No, it uses between 1 and 4 satellites, and transmits on L1 and L5. \"EGNOS uses at least 3 geostationary satellites to transmit receiver clock error and integrity data.\" No, same as above. \"EGNOS uses up to 4 geostationary satellites to transmit to aircraft integrity data and ranging signals.\" This is completely correct, EGNOS uses up to 4 satellites and does transmit integrity data and ranging signals to aircraft. As this is completely correct, we consider it the right answer, over option A.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through detection of errors and the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. An integrity warning is sent after just 6 seconds when using SBAS, but is up to 3 hours when using standard GNSS only. Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. This can then be turned into a distance measurement. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems. Not only this, but more modern GNSS receivers can also pick up very slight changes in signal frequency that occur due to the doppler effect. The doppler effect is where waves (electromagnetic in this case) have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart. As we know the exact frequency that the signal should be (L1 is 1575.42 MHz), and any expected movement of the satellites, our receiver can calculate its own ground speed using the combined doppler effect of all the satellites in view.",

Ephemeris: data which is used to correct the orbital almanac data of the satellite. Satellite clock correction parameters: Despite the high stability of the clocks carried by the GPS, differences in synchronization still exist between the time transmitted by the satellite and the GPS time.

UTC parameters is used to determine the correction the receiver needs to turn the GPS time which it works on into UTC time so it can display to the pilot.

Selective Availability (SA) is included in the User Equivalent Range Error (UERE). Selective Availability. Selective Availability (SA) was a deliberate measure introduced by the U. S. Department of Defense in the mid-1990s to intentionally degrade the accuracy of civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. This degradation reduced the precision of civilian GPS fixes to around 100 meters. SA was achieved by introducing random errors in the satellite clock times, known as dithering SV clock time. In 2000, the U. S. government discontinued SA, ensuring significantly improved accuracy for civilian GPS users and assuring that it would not be reintroduced. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Tropospheric Errors or Delays. Due to the inherent precision of satellite-based navigation systems, changes in tropospheric conditions have a notable impact on the transmission of radio waves. Fluctuations in factors like pressure, temperature, density, and humidity influence the velocity of signal propagation. Greater density and higher absolute humidity result in decreased signal propagation speed. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

The ionosphere is named for its abundance of ions, which are electrically charged particles formed when atoms in the atmosphere are stripped of one or more electrons by solar radiation. The ionosphere can cause the GNSS signals to slow down as they pass through it due to its varying density and composition. This delay leads to variations in the signal path length, which in turn can introduce errors in the determination of positions by GNSS receivers. These errors are particularly significant for signals traveling through higher frequencies, such as those used by GNSS systems that use the UHF frequency band. Receiver clock error, signal multipath, and Dilution of Precision (DoP) are influenced by other factors such as the accuracy of the receiver's clock, reflections of signals from surrounding objects, and geometric relationships between satellites and the receiver's position, respectively.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a pseudo-range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems, and does come with a multitude of errors, which can occur due to inaccurate time references, the Earth's atmosphere/ionosphere slowing down the electromagnetic signals, signal reflections, bad geometry of satellites, etc. Some of these errors can be fixed to a certain degree using methods such as various augmentation systems or extra signals.",

The commonly used frequency bands are L1 and L2, with frequency of 1575.42 MHZ and 1228 MHZ, where L1 is an open civil signal and the signal is circular polarization. Therefore, the GPS jammer in the market is mainly aimed at these two signal frequencies. The signal strength is -166dbw, which is a weak signal. These features determine the preparation of specialized antennas for the reception of GPS signals. The global positioning system (GPS) has been used to support a wide variety of applications, such as high-accuracy positioning and navigation. Differential GPS techniques can largely eliminate common-mode errors between the reference and the rover GPS stations resulting from ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and delays, satellite and receiver clock biases, and orbital errors. The ionospheric delay in the propagation of global positioning system (GPS) signals is one of the main sources of error in GPS precise positioning and navigation. A dual-frequency GPS receiver can eliminate (to the first order) the ionospheric delay through a linear combination of the L1 and L2 observations. Note: The most significant effect of ionospheric delay appear in case of using single frequency data.",

It is currently 18 seconds. 3) Satellite time - A little more complicated, satellite time is the timing within each individual satellite clock. GNSS satellites have 4 separate atomic clocks for immensely accurate time monitoring. These do have miniscule natural errors in themselves, but also have a much larger error due to special and general relativity. To try not to go into too much detail, as the clocks are travelling very fast all the time, a phenomenon called time dilation occurs which makes the satellite clocks tick slower than on Earth, however, the gravitational difference causes an even larger effect that makes the satellite clocks tick faster overall. (The film 'Interstellar' shows the first effect very well). The Satellite clocks tick about 38 microseconds faster than Earth based clocks per day. This error accumulates over time, and is corrected for by the Satellite Clock Correction, also sent in the error message. Microseconds and even nanoseconds are very important to GPS accuracy, as the whole principle is based on accurate time measurements. If the Satellite Clock Correction becomes more than 1 millisecond, the Control Segment resets the satellite clocks to the exact GPS time, and the drifting can begin again.",

These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas and interpretted by a ground station, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. Errors in the receiver, multipath signals, and some small atmospheric propogation errors can still occur, but the intention is to get the accuracy below 1m for aircraft on final approach. The GBAS can also give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect any such faults at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 20 NM (30 km according to the old syllabus) away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. SBAS - SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over a much wider area than GBAS can do. Their geosynchronous orbits mean that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. SBAS works in a very similar way to GBAS, but the reference antennas send their corrections to a master control station, which communicates the wide area corrections to the geostationary satellites for effective distribution over their large usable area. SBAS can also give integrity warnings in the same way that GBAS can, bringing the alerting time down from a potential 3 hours for standard GNSS to 6 seconds for SBAS users.",

GBAS (Ground-Based Augmentation System) is a ground-based system that enhances the accuracy, integrity, and availability of satellite-based navigation signals.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 20,000 km. The system was originally developed by the US government for military navigation but now anyone with a GPS device, be it a SatNav, mobile phone or handheld GPS unit, can receive the radio signals that the satellites broadcast. Wherever you are on the planet, at least four GPS satellites are ‘visible’ at any time. Each one transmits information about its position and the current time at regular intervals. These signals, travelling at the speed of light, are intercepted by your GPS receiver, which calculates how far away each satellite is based on how long it took for the messages to arrive. Once it has information on how far away at least three satellites are, your GPS receiver can pinpoint your location using a process called trilateration. This system consists of three segments: the space segment, the control segment, and the user segment. The U. S. Air Force develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments. Space Segment The space segment consists of a nominal constellation of 24 operating satellites that transmit one-way signals that give the current GPS satellite position and time. Control Segment The control segment consists of worldwide monitor and control stations that maintain the satellites in their proper orbits through occasional command maneuvers, and adjust the satellite clocks. It tracks the GPS satellites, uploads updated navigational data, and maintains health and status of the satellite constellation. User Segment The user segment consists of the GPS receiver equipment, which receives the signals from the GPS satellites and uses the transmitted information to calculate the user's three-dimensional position and time.",

Watch out on this question. It is asking about \"elements\" of satellite based augmentation system (SBAS), which the learning objective above states very clearly, are the ground infrastructure and the communication satellites. This can be confused with the \"segments\" of GNSS and SBAS, of which there are 3, the ground segment, the space segment, and the user segment. SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over very wide area. The satellites involved have geosynchronous orbits, meaning that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors through the many ground stations and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. Signal availability can be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of their other roles, each acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include monitoring stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station which processes the data. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections, and detect any errors with the GNSS signals as soon as they occur.",

GNSS has natural errors and problems which make it unsuitable for precise procedures such as precision approaches. It is fine for en-route navigation and departures/arrivals in most cases, but approaches are more demanding. For this reason, GNSS avionics used in IFR operations should augment the GNSS signal to ensure, among other things, its integrity. To accomplish this, on top of the raw GNSS signal, augmentation systems are employed, which usually are: Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). Often referred to as the Local Area Augmentation (LAAS), due to it's American origin. LAAS/GBAS systems measure the local GNSS signal and broadcast a signal which is used to fix any errors via a VHF datalink to nearby aircraft. LAAS enables ILS-like precision approaches to be flown by aircraft. These type of approaches are commonly called GLS (GBAS Landing system) approaches. It makes the aircraft GNSS systems extremely accurate and gives them excellent integrity monitoring. Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS). SBAS over the US is called the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). SBAS is a similar system to GBAS (above), which uses geostationary satellites to broadcast wide area GNSS signal fixes, provided by receivers and a control station on the ground. In Europe this is called EGNOS. => Given the American terminology used by this question, we assume that the question asks from a point of view of GNSS theory only, therefore WAAS and LAAS is the correct option. The question also is worded in a very misleading way, so is important to read properly and remember for the exam. The current feedback supports the wording and and answer we have shown. Any further exam feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or put in the comments. Thank you.",

AAIM uses additional on-board sensors (such as barometric altimeter and inertial reference system) to cross-check the GNSS position. It compares the 3D position with the navigation information from on-board systems and not with signals from other satellites. => If the Inertial Reference System (IRS) is lost, barometric altitude from AAIM and the RAIM function are still available.",

Each fix excludes 1 satellite, so the receiver knows if they are all correct or not, thereby noticing if any one satellite becomes faulty, as all the separate fixes will then be different from each other. This can tell us within a few seconds if a satellite that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD) If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). The amount of required satellites can be reduced by 1 for 2D fixes, but these are uncommon, unless barometric altitude is fed to the GNSS system, which can allow an extra \"range sphere\", and effectively acts like another satellite.

The GPS Control Segment is composed by a network of Monitor Stations (MS), a Master Control Station (MCS), a backup of the MCS and the Ground Antennas (GA). The Master Control Station (MCS) processes the measurements received by the Monitor Stations (MS) to estimate satellite orbits (ephemerides) and clock errors, among other parameters, and to generate the navigation message. These corrections and the navigation message are uploaded to the satellites through the Ground Antennas, which are co-located in four of the Monitor stations (Ascension Island, Cape Canaveral, Diego Garcia, and Kwajalein). The main tasks performed by the CS are the following: Monitoring and control of satellite orbital parameters; Monitoring health and status of the satellite subsystems (solar arrays, battery power and the level of propellant used for maneuvers); Activation of spare satellites; Update of parameters in the navigation message (ephemeris, almanac and clock corrections); Resolving satellite anomalies; Controlling Selective Availability (SA) and Anti-Spoofing (A/S) Passive tracking of the satellites.",

Each sub-frame takes 6 seconds to transmit, resulting in a total frame duration of 30 seconds for the receiver to capture. In detail: Frame 1 includes information about SV clock error. Frames 2 and 3 contain SV ephemeris data. Frame 4 provides details on the ionospheric propagation model, GPS time, and its correlation with UTC. Frame 5 is reserved for transmitting the current SV constellation almanac data. To acquire the complete almanac, a sequence of 25 frames must be received.

The commonly used frequency bands are L1 and L2, with frequency of 1575.42MHZ and 1228MHZ, where L1 is an open civil signal and the signal is circular polarization. Therefore, the GPS jammer in the market is mainly aimed at these two signal frequencies. The signal strength is -166dbw, which is a weak signal. These features determine the preparation of specialized antennas for the reception of GPS signals. The global positioning system (GPS) has been used to support a wide variety of applications, such as high-accuracy positioning and navigation. Differential GPS techniques can largely eliminate common-mode errors between the reference and the rover GPS stations resulting from ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and delays, satellite and receiver clock biases, and orbital errors. The ionospheric delay in the propagation of global positioning system (GPS) signals is one of the main sources of error in GPS precise positioning and navigation. A dual-frequency GPS receiver can eliminate (to the first order) the ionospheric delay through a linear combination of the L1 and L2 observations. Note: The most significant effect of ionospheric delay appear in case of using single frequency data.",

SATELLITE BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and spreads it over very wide area. The satellites involved have geostationary orbits, meaning that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. As previously mentioned, EGNOS is the european SBAS, and provides its service using the normal L1 frequency band, the same as the C/A signal for GPS, but obviously contains different data such as the range modifications for each satellite and any integrity and availability messages. SBAS also allows its geostationary satellites to provide another GNSS signal for extra availability, also on that frequency. The 5 digit code that is individual to each approach procedure is just an identifier code to tell the system which procedure you will be doing, it does not change the frequency band that is picked up. It is important to note that just because SBAS uses the same frequency band as GPS, receivers are not automatically capable of receiving and processing the extra information provided.",

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. This question, however, is much simpler than upon initial inspection, as it is just asking about how many satellites we require for a 3D position, which is 4 satellites. Standard GNSS relies on satellites transmitting a timing signal (called the PRN signal) with exact timing data included, so that the receiver can measure this against the known time, and calculate a distance from all the satellites within view. Then a process called trilateration is used to determine the exact position of the receiver from multiple ranges from satellites of known locations (which creates multiple range spheres around the satellites, and the receiver is where the faces of all spheres meet [annex 2 above]). The GBAS signal does not require any more or less satellite ranges than this, as 4 is sufficient to perform its job (RAIM and geostationary satellites are not required for GBAS). More satellites are usually more accurate, but with GBAS, the accuracy is extremely high anyway, so it does not make much difference.",

These are measurable errors, which are measured by multiple receiver antennas and interpreted by a ground station, usually located at an airport which can make use of this highly accurate GNSS. Errors in the receiver, multipath signals, and some small atmospheric propagation errors can still occur, but the intention is to get the accuracy below 1m for aircraft on final approach. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station, although there is the capability for a network of such stations in the future. The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently, and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The GBAS positioning service is a terminal version of GBAS, and is useful for high accuracy navigation and fast integrity monitoring in the terminal areas around airports.",

This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate wide-area corrections. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches, to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200 ft. To tune into a GNSS approach with SBAS augmentation, a 5-digit channel is enterred into the guidance system, which then accesses the correct information to augment the GNSS signal as required.

Because the speed of light is known, the time it takes for the signal to reach a ground-based receiver can be used to calculate the distance from the satellite. Galileo’s timing needs to be accurate to the scale of nanosecond so this distance can be derived to a very high degree of certainty. Combine inputs from several satellites simultaneously and the receiver’s place in the world is pinpointed: Galileo’s aim is to deliver accuracy in the metre range once the full system is completed. Each satellite is equipped with two indipendent, non-identical atomic clocks, all of them are based on regular oscillations (traditionally the swing of a pendulum, tick of clockwork or pulse of quartz crystal). Highly accurate atomic clocks rely on switches between energy states of an atom’s electron shell, induced by light, laser or maser energy – if you force atoms to jump from one particular energy state to another, it will radiate an associated microwave signal at an extremely stable frequency. Note: The passive hydrogen maser clock is the master clock on board each satellite. It is an atomic clock which uses the ultra stable 1.4 GHz transition in a hydrogen atom to measure time to within 0.45 nanoseconds over 12 hours.",

Within low and mid latitudes there are usually more than 4 satellites in view of any receiver, however, as you get closer to the poles, the satellites in view become fewer and quickly drop below the 4 required. Extra range can be gained when at high altitude, as the horizon is much less restrictive there.

The GPS receivers generate code pseudorange to determine the user’s position. They also monitor changes in signal frequency to produce a rate of change of range measurements to determine velocity. The time between the transmission of the signal and its arrival at the receiver is measured. The transmitter-to-receiver distance can then be obtained by scaling the signal transit time by the speed of light. Using the concept of trilateration, a GPS receiver can determine its position using the measured travel time along with the satellites’ locations that are obtained from the navigation message carried by the signal. Though three satellites can be used to determine the user’s position, at least four are required owing to an additional estimation of the receiver clock offset. Using four satellites to find the position improves the accuracy of the solution by eliminating the receiver clock offset. The first and second user-to-satellite range measurements define two spheres on two different satellites, and the intersection of these two spheres defines a circle of possible receiver positions. A third range measurement, intersecting with the first two, narrows those receiver positions to an ambiguous pair, while the fourth measurement resolves this ambiguity and determines the clock bias.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.04: State that ionospheric delay is the most significant error. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Receiver quality Multipath error Dilution Of Precision (DOP) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Ionospheric errors are the greatest errors affecting GNSS accuracy. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. The term \"User Equivalent Range Error (UERE)\" is the combination of all satellite and SiS (Signal-in-Space) errors, and includes all GNSS errors except for Dilution of Precision, which is a different type of error.",

Each fix excludes 1 satellite, so the receiver knows if they are all correct or not, as they will all be correct if all the positions are the same, thereby noticing if any one satellite becomes faulty, as all the separate fixes will then be different from each other. This can tell us within 6 seconds if one of the satellites that we are using becomes faulty, rather than waiting a potential 3 hours for it to be noticed by the master station and taken offline. This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD). If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which one is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). RAIM does not require anything more than a RAIM capable reciever and enough standard GNSS satellites to perform its integrity monitoring. It is a type of Air Based Augmentation System (ABAS), the other of which is called Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM), which uses onboard location data such as IRS and barometric altimeter information to verify the integrity of the GNSS position. AAIM can actually assist RAIM, if the two systems are suitably paired, and can allow for one less satellite to be required in some cases (2D fix).",

This RAIM feature is called Fault Detection (FD). It does not tell us which is the faulty satellite, as this is mathematically impossible to work out with so little data If we use a second extra satellite, (a total of 6 for a 3D fix), then we can also reliably calculate which is the faulty satellite and remove it from usage, called Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE). The amount of required satellites can be reduced by 1 for 2D fixes, but these are not used unless barometric altitude is fed to the GNSS system, which can allow an extra \"range sphere\", and effectively acts like another satellite.

Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) SBAS uses the idea of differential GPS (dGPS) and does a very similar job to GBAS, just over a much wider area. Their geosynchronous orbits mean that they stay over the same place on the Earth all the time, and can reduce GNSS errors and increase integrity over a very large area. This means that there are multiple around the world, WAAS for the USA, EGNOS for Europe, GAGAN for India, MSAS for Japan, etc. Accuracy is enhanced through the transmission of wide-area corrections for GNSS range errors, such as ephemeris, satellite clock errors and ionospheric propagation. Integrity is enhanced by the SBAS network quickly detecting satellite signal errors and sending alerts to receivers that they should not track the failed satellite. This means that SBAS can reduce the notice time of a failure from a potential 3 hours (standard GPS) to only 6 seconds (SBAS). Signal availability can also be improved as the SBAS transmits ranging signals from its satellites, on top of its other roles, it acts as an extra GNSS satellite. SBAS systems include reference stations, which are geographically distributed throughout the SBAS service area, receive GNSS signals and forward them to the master station. Since the locations of the reference stations are accurately known, the master station can accurately calculate GNSS range corrections over a very wide area. SBAS can be used to make aircraft GNSS systems far more accurate on approaches (1-2 m horizontally and 3-5 m vertically), to allow for lower minimums on instrument approaches using this system. They are able to give vertical guidance on approaches also, similar to the role of baro-VNAV on LNAV/VNAV approaches. They can even be used to refine the GNSS signal for LPV approaches (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) which have decision heights as low as 200ft.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. Any GNSS system (GPS/NAVSTAR in this question) has three segments, a control segment, a space segment and a user segment. This question asks about one of the main functions of the space segment, which is primarily there to transmit the signals that the receivers use to calculate their positions with. Not only positions, but also the exact time is sent in every transmission and the velocity of the receiver can be calculated by measuring the doppler shift of the frequencies. The satellites do not perform position calculations for us, and our receivers do not make any replies to the satellites. Nor do the satellites do their own orbital tracking and corrections, that is controlled by the control segment, and the master station on the ground.",

Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.01: List the most significant factors that affect accuracy: ionospheric propagation delay; dilution of precision; satellite clock error; satellite orbital variations; multipath. Learning Objective 062.06.01.03.02: State that a user equivalent range error (UERE) can be computed from all these factors. URE (User Range Error) is a collection of signal errors that cause GNSS inaccuracies. URE just contains all the errors except receiver errors and dilution of precision (DOP). There is another similar measure called UERE (User Equivalent Range Error) which also contains the receiver errors, but not DOP. LONG EXPLANATION Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is based on the pseudorange between satellites and receivers. The ‘time of flight’ of radio signals from several satellites to a receiver is used to calculate pseudorange or pseudo-distances. Multiple pseudoranges allow a process called trilateration to give a receiver its location. The term ‘pseudorange’ is used to distinguish it from true range, as it may be affected by various sources of error in time of flight measurement. Even the smallest timing errors can result in large position errors: for example, a millionth of a second timing error can create a distance error 0.16 NM. Various types of error may degrade precision, including the following: Ionospheric and tropospheric errors Satellite clock errors Ephemeris data errors Multipath error Receiver quality Dilution Of Precision (DOP) *Errors in Bold above are part of the URE (User Range Error) SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with theses ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The orbital errors arise through solar winds and varying gravitational forces, such as those of the sun and the moon. The navigation message includes ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. The almanac also gives the rough expected positions of the satellites in the future. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will create a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles.",

Airborne-Based Augmentation System (ABAS) To meet the ICAO requirements for navigation, the GPS system needs to be augmented by using ground-based and space-based augmentation systems. This improves accuracy and provides necessary integrity and timely alerts. A third augmentation system, the Airborne-based Augmentation Aystem (ABAS) is used at the level of the aircraft and comes in two types, which are used together. The first type is the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), which is a stand-alone integrity control by the receiver based on the redundancy and geometry of GPS satellite vehicles. Note that RAIM provides integrity but does not improve the stand-alone GPS accuracy. The second type is the Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM), which is also a stand-alone integrity control. It is based on the combination of GPS signals with other sensors such as radio navigation (Rad Nav) facilities and/or inertial navigation systems (IRS).",

Taking a look at the learning objective above, we can see that a 25 NM final is outside of the maximum 20 NM range of the minimum software designed coverage area of the GBAS landing system (GLS) approach. In fact, GBAS is only effective out to a range of 20 NM from the airport due to its highly localised augmentation. Therefore, accepting a vector to a 25 NM final is not technically allowed, as for a few miles, the aircraft does not have any approved navigation. In reality, the GNSS system would allow the pilots to intercept the inbound course themselves and then fully intercept the GLS approach once inside the coverage area, but from a technical and legal standpoint, this is not allowed.",

Therefore, the only possible GNSS error caused by the ionosphere is \"longer path length\". SOURCES OF ERROR Ionospheric Errors. The ionosphere is the layer of the atmosphere between approximately 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. This layer contains ions which are electrically charged. When the GNSS signal passes through this layer, its interaction with these ions reduces its speed and therefore introduces an error. These ions alter the transmission time of satellite signals and can cause significant satellite position errors (typically ±5 meters). Ionospheric delay may vary depending on solar activity, the time of year, time of day or location, making it very difficult to predict the induced delay. On the other hand, the troposphere is the layer closest to the earth surface. It is approximately 8 and 14 km deep, depending on the location on the Earth’s surface. Tropospheric errors can also exist, but are far smaller and due to temperature and density factors mostly, and are not mentioned in the Learning Objectives. Satellite Clock Errors. Although GNSS satellites use the most precise atomic clocks featuring nanosecond accuracy, the clock drift phenomena may cause minute inaccuracies which can produce errors that affect positioning. Ephemeris Data Error. These are errors induced by the satellite’s location. An ‘ephemeris error’ describes the difference between the expected and actual orbital position of a GNSS satellite. Because GNSS receivers use the satellite's location in pseudorange calculations, orbital error reduces GNSS accuracy. The navigation messages include ephemeris data together with information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac. Ephemeris are used to calculate the position and the clock deviation of the receiver; the almanac is used to check the visible satellites from a receiver according to the moment of time and its position. Receiver Quality. The hardware used within the receiver may limit precision by introducing inaccuracies in receiver timing. Multipath Errors. Multipath errors appear when a GNSS signal arrives at the receiver GNSS antenna after having been reflected from an object such as the surface of a building. The reflected signal clearly has to travel further to reach the antenna and so it arrives with a slight delay. This delay can cause positional error. Dilution Of Precision (DOP). DOP error may be caused by the relative positions in three-dimensional space of the satellites used to calculate a position. To get a better understanding, the concept of Geometrical DOP (GDOP) is often used. Poor GDOP values mean ‘bad’ positioning of satellites. On the contrary, ‘well’ distributed satellites produce good values. Satellites that are closer together will greate a less accurate position measurement, whereas satellites which are well spread around the sky will give a more accurate position of the receiver, as the spheres of pseudorange cut each other at better angles. Error characterization. Small timing errors may produce large positioning errors. The accumulative effect of GNSS pseudorange error is described by a factor known as UERE (User Equivalent Range Error, sometimes referred to as ‘URA’ in some GNSS documentation). This value expresses the individual error contribution to the global error.",

Each satellite transmits a constant coded electromagnetic message, called the PRN (Pseudo-random noise) as well as a navigation message which contains extra data useful to our receiver. The PRN code contains immensely precise timing data from when it was transmitted by the satellite. This timing data allows us to measure the time between when a message was sent and when it arrives at the receiver. As we know that these electromagnetic messages travel at the speed of light, we can calculate how far they have travelled between the transmitter and the receiver. This distance means that we can draw a 3D sphere around the satellite, called a range sphere, in the knowledge that the receiver is somewhere on that sphere edge. With multiple satellites in the sky above our receiver, this process can happen multiple times, every time giving us anther range sphere that narrows down a receiver's location further. For a 3 dimensional position fix to be made, we need 4 range spheres, and therefore 4 usable satellites in view. This is the basic principle of operation of all GNSS systems This timing data does also mean that our receiver always has the exact time reference. Not only this, but more modern GNSS receivers can also pick up very slight changes in signal frequency that occur due to the doppler effect. The doppler effect is where waves (electromagnetic in this case) have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart. As we know the exact frequency that the signal should be (L1 is 1575.42 MHz), and any expected movement of the satellites, our receiver can calculate its own ground speed using the combined doppler effect of all the satellites in view.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.01: State that radio waves in VHF, UHF, SHF and EHF propagate as space waves. Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like reflection from afar, and they may refer to it as such. Ground waves and sky waves both exist below the frequencies of VHF (30 MHz). Some strong ionospheric attenuation effects can affect the lower end of the VHF band, but in general, VHF, UHF and upwards all rely on space waves to communicate, and hence are reliant on line-of-sight.",

In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Interference is the phenomenon where waves meet each other and combine additively or substractively to form composite waves. In a sense there are similarities between interference and diffraction in the fact that both phenomena from a given wave produce other waves (with in general different frequency or phase and/or amplitude etc.). The main difference is the mechanism, diffraction involves a wave and some obstacle or object which deflects the wave or bends it and intereference involves a wave which combine with other waves.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed at the end, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) so FM (Frequency Modulation) is usually more clear, but has its own disadvantages.",

            "explanation": "A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation. APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it can only be figure 1 or 6 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for an ILS mode, where the frequency of the ILS is indicated at the bottom of the display. Figure 1 indicates ‘VOR’ and figure 6 indicates ‘ILS’ with its associated frequency on the right of the ND. Therefore, the correct ND is represented in figure 6.",

            "explanation": "Radio waves propagate as surface waves, sky waves or space waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. Surface wave propagation can be achieved in VLF, LF, MF and HF radio waves. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Space wave propagation is achieved at VHF frequencies and above. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Surface waves ⇒ VLF, LF, MF and HF Sky waves ⇒ HF Space waves ⇒ VHF and above",

If the turn is unbalanced, an aircraft either slips into, or skids out of the turn, thereby reducing the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds",

Monopole antenna: This antenna has a more complicated design. A monopole antenna, as seen in figure 2, consists of a single conductor, usually attached to the ground. Because of the use of only one conductor, the monopole antenna has twice the gain of a similar dipole antenna. Loop antenna: Loop antenna, as the name suggests, suggest of a loop of wire. Loop antennas, as seen in figure 3, correspond directly with the magnetic field of the radio wave, which means they are insensitive to electrical noise. Quadrupole antenna: As the name suggests, this antenna consists of 4 parts. This is the most complex form of antenna and therefore not much used. As seen in figure 4, it consists of 4 monopole antennas attached in order.",

These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Many RADARs are so-called \"Pulse RADARs\", as they operate by transmitting a very short pulse of a particular frequency, then they wait for a much longer time to receive a potential reflection off an object in that direction. Any such reflections are called returns, and the time between the pulse and the return can be used to calculate the distance to the object, as these pulses travel at the speed of light. This means that the pulse returns carry time data, which is information that the RADAR can use. These RADARs usually scan from side to side, and do this process hundreds or thousands of times per second, which allows obect locations to be plotted on a display. This is a modern usage of pulse modulation.",

It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. VORs use this principle in Doppler VORs (DVORs) which are the modern versions of VOR beacons. The variphase signal of the VOR is transmitted by a ring of antennas in a circle, and the signal transfers to each consecutive antenna, so the transmission point of the signal effectively moves round in a circle. This allows an aircraft to receive a frequency modulated signal due to the Doppler effect, to compare phase difference with the amplitude modulated reference signal, and calculate the aircraft's radial. GNSS (including GPS) systems use the Doppler effect to measure an object's speed, as the pseudo-random noise (PRN) signals are on an exact frequency, and the receiver knows the velocities of each satellite, so is able to work out the relative movement of the receiver with very small Doppler changes in frequency. MTI (Moving Target Indication) is less common to hear about, but this system allows a RADAR to know which objects are moving towards or away from the station due to the Doppler effect of their reflected pulses. It can be used to only show moving targets and remove radar clutter. Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) use the Doppler effect to judge the relative movements of moisture particles (raindrops, hail, etc.) based on the frequency of the reflected returns. If this movement is large and erratic, the RADAR system can then show it as an area of turbulence, which is useful information for the pilot. DMEs use a system of time measurement to measure distance from a ground station, and the \"groundspeed\" function uses the rate of change of that distance, not the Doppler effect. ILSs use difference in depth of modulation as a method of working out how far off localiser/glideslope the aircraft is, not the Doppler effect. AWRs have a mapping mode, but this does not use any Doppler measurements, as the ground is supposed to stay still.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 375 kHz, which is 375 x103 Hz or 0.375 MHz. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 375x103 = 800 m",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption. Note: The reduction in side lobes is the main improvement referred to in the question, but there is also an option which mentions the reduced beam width. Whilst the beam width is thinner for a modern flat plate antenna, the use of the word \"considerably\" does make that option more specific, and less likely to be correct. This is backed up with feedback showing that the \"reduced side lobe\" answer is considered correct by EASA.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 118.7 MHz, which is 118.7 x106 Hz or 118 700 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 118.7x106 = 2.53 m",

            "explanation": "HF propagation over long distances during day and night is by skywave propagation originated by the reflection and refraction of radio waves between Earth's surface and the ionosphere. HF Radio waves can be reflected by the ionosphere and the earth's surface and propagate long distance from the transmitter to the receiver with several hops. Path loss of sky wave propagation varies with different conditions of ionosphere and types of the earth's surfaces. The ionosphere is a consequence of radiation from the sun ionizing Earth's atmosphere, so it changes significantly with time of day and sunspot activity. The F layer is mostly responsible for the refraction of radio waves back to Earth, preventing them from escaping to space. The other layers interact in other ways. During the day, the D layer forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers. The D layer is present during the day and is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses ( for MF and LF power loss is so high that sky-wave propagation is not possible for them). Hf frequency can propagate like ground wave as well but their range is very small: as the wavefront of the ground wave travels along the Earth's surface it is attenuated. The degree of attenuation is dependent upon a variety of factors. Frequency of the radio signal is one of the major determining factor as losses rise with increasing frequency. As a result, it makes this form of propagation impracticable above the bottom end of the HF portion of the spectrum (3 MHz). Typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB more than one at 0.5 MHz dependent upon a variety of factors in the signal path including the distance. In view of this it can be seen why even high power HF radio broadcast stations may only be audible for a few miles from the transmitting site via the ground wave",

            "explanation": "Amplitude modulation is a process by which the wave signal is transmitted by modulating the amplitude of the signal. It is often called as AM and is commonly used in transmitting a piece of information through a radio carrier wave. Amplitude modulation is mostly used in the form of electronic communication. Currently, this technique is used in many areas of communication such as in portable two-way radios, citizens band radio, VHF aircraft radio and in modems for computers. Amplitude modulation is also used to mention the mediumwave AM radio broadcasting. In general, amplitude modulation definition is given as a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in some proportion with respect to the modulating data or the signal. As for the mechanism, when amplitude modulation is used there is a variation in the amplitude of the carrier. Here, the voltage or the power level of the information signal changes the amplitude of the carrier. In AM, the carrier does not vary in amplitude. However, the modulating data is in the form of signal components consisting of frequencies either higher or lower than that of the carrier. The signal components are known as sidebands and the sideband power is responsible for the variations in the overall amplitude of the signal. (refer to annex1) The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. (refer to annex 2) Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.02: State that radio waves in LF, MF and HF propagate as surface/ground waves and sky waves. This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both ground waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth - also called surface waves) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere). This can actually cause some interference when the two meet, especially at night when the ionosphere is thinner.",

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) produce a classification system for each type of radio wave, describing in 3 characters how a radio wave is modulated. Modulation is the act of putting information onto a radio wave, and includes pulse modulation, frequency modulation or amplitude modulation. The first letter is how the wave is modulated, the second character is what type of information is modulated onto the wave (digital, analogue, etc.) and the third is the information output (morse code, voice, etc.). The 3 character abbreviation for an old style NDB ident is A1A (These have keyed morse code modulation, BFO mode must be used to here the ident.), and a newer NDB ident is A2A (which has amplitude modulated morse code, so you can listen to it in any mode). The NDB carrier wave is N0N; it is not modulated and carries no information. The learning objectives also state that we must know the classification for VHF communication waves, which is A3E as per the above LO. This is the limit of the learning objectives on these classifications. You do not need to find and memorise the table.",

Mixing of low frequency signal with high frequency carrier signal is called modulation. The sinusoidal signal that is used in the modulation is known as the carrier signal, or simply \"the carrier\". The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal (or sinusoidal signal) is known as the \"data signal\" or the \"message signal\". A carrier wave is a pure wave of constant frequency, a bit like a sine wave. By itself it doesn’t carry much information that we can relate to (such as speech or data). To include speech information or data information, another wave needs to be imposed, called an input signal, on top of the carrier wave. This process of imposing an input signal onto a carrier wave is called modulation. In other words, modulation changes the shape of a carrier wave to somehow encode the speech or data information that we were interested in carrying. Modulation is like hiding a code inside the carrier wave. Recall that any wave has three basic properties: Amplitude – the height of the wave Frequency – a number of waves passing through in a given second Phase – where the phase is at any given moment.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.03.01: Define ‘space waves’: the electromagnetic waves travelling through the air directly from the transmitter to the receiver. As the aircraft in this scenario is communicating with the ground station via VHF radio, the radio signals will only propagate as space waves. Space waves are line-of-sight waves that go in straight lines only, and therefore cannot go around obstacles, including around the Earth's horizon. This means that there is a very well defined limit of how far VHF communications can be received from. It is calculated with the formula: Range (nm) = 1.23 x √(height of transmitter(ft)) + 1.23 x √(height of receiver(ft)) As soon as the aircraft is outside of this range, VHF communication will not be possible. Relays with other aircraft closer to land could be used, but the aircraft will usually change to HF radio and datalink communications instead. HF radio can travel as a sky wave, which requires ionospheric refraction to \"bounce\" the signal off the upper atmosphere, and as a short surface/ground wave (although this is not really used), so can allow transmissions that can go further than the line-of-sight limitations of VHF. VHF has a frequency too high to be affected much by ionospheric attenuation and refraction, and therefore will not be able to form a sky wave. Its frequency is also too high to propagate for any reasonable distances as a ground wave, as the attenuation due to obstacles, etc. is huge. Even HF radio struggles to propagate as ground waves for our uses, so VHF is ever worse. There is some diffraction of VHF radio waves around the Earth's surface, which extends range slightly, but it is not a huge effect. Note: The mention of dawn in the question is not necessary, VHF radio is not affected by ionospheric refraction which could create a sky wave, so dawn/dusk/night does not make a difference.",

Tropospheric refraction occurs because the refractive index of the atmosphere decreases as altitude increases, leading to a bending of waves back toward the earth. Conversely, ionospheric refraction occurs because of the electrical properties of plasmas that are formed in the ionosphere as a result of ionization of the atmosphere. Reflection off the ionosphere is also possible if the frequency is low enough. We will differentiate these two effects, and refer to the former as atmospheric refraction and the latter as ionospheric propagation. The atmosphere will also attenuate radio signals, due to absorption by air molecules, water molecules, and precipitation (rain) The most important thing to note is that refractivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to pressure and humidity. Hence, as we go higher into the atmosphere, the refractivity tends to drop somce the pressure is less, and the air is more dry. Temperature plays a role as well, and in reality temperature gradients can cause the refractivity profile to be non-monotonic.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed in the receiver, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) and it also produces two \"side bands\" of information, one wave at the top, on at the bottom, of which one can be removed to save on power and bandwidth, as is done with HF communications in aviation.",

Circular polarization can be applied into different uses. One of them is a helical antennae. In circular polarization the electrical field rotates at the frequency of the radiowave. Circular polarization is used in radar systems because when the energy is reflected from water droplets the circularity is reversed and therefore the so called ‘clutter’ of precipitation can be eliminated.",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption.",

            "explanation": "HF radio waves propagate as both surface waves and sky waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. IONISATION AND SKIP DISTANCE At a fixed frequency, if ionisation decreases, the critical angle increases. This causes an increase in skip distance. Ionosphere exists due to Sun radiation. During dusk and night, Sun radiation is less and ionisation decreases, causing skip distance to become larger. This means that, for a constant frequency, the first sky wave reflects further away during the night than during the day. The aircraft is following an East Track (090°) and the Sun has set. This means that dusk is experienced and the decrease in ionisation causes the sky waves to propagate with a larger skip distance. If the aircraft was receiving surface waves, the sunset would not affect their perception. Consequently, the aircraft was receiving sky waves and the ionospheric changes have affected their path. The aircraft has entered the skip zone between the skywave and the surface wave (dead space).",

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial. The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readingsi. This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

As mentioned in the above learning objective, \"phase\" is a way to measure the position within a wave cycle. For instance, the first quarter of a wave cycle (from equilibrium up to the first peak, for example) is a phase of 1/4, but as we measure phases in terms of angles, it is 90º (1/4 of 360º). This means that a whole wave cycle makes up 360º of phase, which would represent a full circle, which is correct as circles are closely linked to waves. Phase can either dictate a position within a wave, or a \"distance\" within a wave, for instance a peak and a trough are 180º different in phase. It can also, in the same way, compare the timings of two waves (of the same frequency), called phase difference. Phase difference can tell us that two similar waves are at different points during their wave cycles, so if two waves were 180º out of phase, one would be at a peak and the other would be at a trough at the same time. In this question though, we are talking about \"phase\" only, not phase difference, so it is the first of these, the position within a wave cycle, expressed as an angle from 0-360º",

Knowing this, it cannot be figure 1 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint.

Figure 4 indicates ‘VOR’, and on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.02.01.01: Define ‘antenna’: an antenna or aerial is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa. An antenna operates by converting electric power into radio waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation. When an alternating current (AC) flows through the antenna, it generates an oscillating electric field. This electric field, in turn, creates a corresponding magnetic field, resulting in the formation of electromagnetic waves. In other words, an electromagnetic wave is simply a constantly changing electric field and a constantly changing magnetic field travelling outwards from a source. Electric fields and magnetic fields are integrally linked, and happen perpendicular to each other. Take a simple dipole antenna as an example. When a current is applied in one direction, it causes electrons to flow towards one side of the antenna, generating an electromagnetic field that surrounds the antenna. If we then reverse the current direction, the electromagnetic field also reverses, creating a ripple effect that propagates outward from the antenna. This ripple is the initial formation of a radio wave. To generate a continuous radio wave, we repeatedly switch the direction of the current in the antenna. This continuous back-and-forth switching of the current creates a series of ripples that propagate through space at the speed of light. Within the antenna, the electrons move back and forth at a frequency determined by us, which corresponds to the frequency of the radio waves produced. This back-and-forth movement of current is known as alternating current (AC).",

            "explanation": "Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct). Higher frequencies receive less ionospheric attenuation, therefore refracting less, and not bending as sharply in the ionosphere. This means that higher frequency radio signals do not \"bounce\" off the ionosphere at steep angles, thus making the skip distance longer. See the second annex above. The height of the ionosphere also makes a difference, a higher ionosphere means that the signals will travel further before reaching the level where refraction begins, and will travel further on the way back down also. This means that a higher ionosphere contributes to a longer skip distance.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. Two sidebands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one sideband to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means to accept HF radio, our receiver has to be of the single-sideband (SSB) type. This question is a bit too ambiguous, as it does not mention that we are picking up a HF VOLMET broadcast in simple terms. Instead it hints at the HF part as it is a long-haul flight currently en route, and that it is a VOLMET as they are trying to pick up \"meteorological information\". The learning objective above is very clear on this though, and once that LO is known, it is obvious what the question writer is getting at.",

A parabolic antenna is an antenna that consists out of a parabolic reflector to direct radio waves. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is the capability of the high directivity of the radio waves. Parabolic antennas are mainly used for point-to-point communications which uses the so called ‘high-gain antennas’. They work as either transmitters, receivers, or both. As transmitters, they produce a signal from the central point, backwards into the reflector dish. The parabolic shape directs all those signals in one direction (the direction the dish is pointing). As receivers, they do the exact opposite, taking in signals into the dish from a certain angle, then reflecting those all onto the central point (located at the focal point of the parabola.",

Further feedback is therefore requested, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Long distance voice communications (outside the line-of-sight) in aviation are achieved by using HF radio. HF (High Frequency) radio waves travel as space waves, but are also low enough frequency to be suitably refracted in the ionosphere, and can return as sky waves. They do also travel as ground (surface) waves, but they do not have a long range in this propagation method, so are not usually used like this. In other words, they can do all 3 propagation types, but we use them as sky waves. In particular, we use HF radio via sky waves for long distance communication, but with this method comes some limitations and complexity. The biggest limitation is the fact that sky waves have both a maximum range and a minimum range. The minimum range is that of the \"first skip\". As sky waves effectively \"bounce\" off the ionosphere, but cannot bounce at too steep of an angle (think of skimming stones), there is a minimum distance at which each frequency first arrives back at ground level. (For those who are interested, it is closer for low frequencies, and further away for high frequencies). This is called the skip distance, and there is a large distance between the end of the ground waves and the start of the sky waves that we call \"dead space\" or the \"skip zone\", where no signal is received. This \"first skip\" distance increases massively at night, when ionisation from the Sun is removed, and the ionosphere becomes a lot less \"bouncy\" to our signals. Now to our scenario. Not only are we flying towards the ATC transmitter/receiver (and therefore getting closer to the \"dead space area\"), but the night effect is beginning and our region of dead space is getting further and further away from the ground station. This means that it is incredibly likely that \"10 minutes later\", we are now inside that first skip distance (but still way further away that space or ground waves), and are therefore in \"dead space\", sometimes called the \"skip zone\". For those who might like to see it: a quick explanation of each option: \"The aircraft is now inside the skip zone, between the ground wave and the sky wave, and therefore cannot receive the controller.\" As described above, not only is the \"first skip\" distance increasing, but also we are flying towards it, so it is incredibly likely that we are now inside the \"skip zone\", so this is correct. \"The sky wave and ground wave are fading each other out as they arrive out of phase.\" This can happen intermittently, but only when both the sky and ground waves are being received, which cannot happen in HF radio, due to the short range of the ground wave and long \"first skip\" of the sky wave. \"The ground wave has been reduced by the night effect and the aircraft is no longer within its range.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback; we do not really use the ground wave of HF radio (range is too short), and it is not really affected by the night effect. \"The aircraft's communication systems have all failed. It must immediately declare emergency and divert to the nearest suitable alternate.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback. This is unlikely to have happened (when you understand HF radio you know there is a much better explanation), and the rest is made purposefully ridiculous.",

            "explanation": "The Sky Waves are the radiowaves of frequency between 2 MHz to 30 MHz. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

Light is called unpolarized if the direction of this electric field fluctuates randomly in time. Many common light sources such as sunlight, halogen lighting, LED spotlights, and incandescent bulbs produce unpolarized light. If the direction of the electric field of light is well defined, it is called polarized light. The most common source of polarized light is a laser. Depending on how the electric field is oriented, we classify polarized light into three types of polarizations: Linear polarization: the electric field of light is confined to a single plane along the direction of propagation Circular polarization: the electric field of light consists of two linear components that are perpendicular to each other, equal in amplitude, but have a phase difference of π/2. The resulting electric field rotates in a circle around the direction of propagation and, depending on the rotation direction, is called left- or right-hand circularly polarized light. Elliptical polarization: the electric field of light describes an ellipse. This results from the combination of two linear components with differing amplitudes and/or a phase difference that is not π/2. This is the most general description of polarized light, and circular and linear polarized light can be viewed as special cases of elliptically polarized light.",

            "explanation": "As the name implies, Phase Modulation, PM uses variations in phase for carrying the modulation. Phase modulation works by modulating the phase of the signal, i.e. changing the rate at which the point moves around the circle. This changes the phase of the signal from what it would have been if no modulation was applied. In other words the speed of rotation around the circle is modulated about the mean value. To achieve this it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal for a short time. In other words when phase modulation is applied to a signal there are frequency changes and vice versa. Phase and frequency are inseparably linked as phase is the integral of frequency. Note: For the ranging codes and navigation messages to travel from the satellite to the receiver, they must be modulated onto a carrier frequency, by varying the phase of the signal ( phase modulation). As soon as a data signal will be modulated onto the carrier wave, the phase of the carrier wave is reversed by 180°. The receiver will detect this reversal and is able to reconstruct the data.",

These waves propagation can be classified depending upon the frequencies as: Ground waves propagation Skywave propagation Free space propagation Ground wave propagation is a type of radio propagation which is also known as a surface wave. These waves propagate over the earth’s surface in low and medium frequencies. These are mainly used for transmission between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere. These are made up of the number of constituent waves. The reason why it is known as a ground wave is that it is the sum of the waves that are reflected by the earth’s surface or any hills. The waves follow the curvature of the earth enabling them to cover beyond the horizon. Beyond the horizon, the waves get blocked by the curvature of the earth and the signals are produced by the diffracted surface wave. Advantages of Ground Wave Propagation These waves have the tendency to bend around the corners or obstructions during propagation which makes them more efficient and also these are not affected by the change in atmospheric conditions. Disadvantages of Ground Wave Propagation High-frequency waves cannot be transmitted as the energy losses are more because of the absorption of energy in the earth’s atmosphere. These are used to cover short ranges and also involves attenuation of waves as they interact with the eddy currents produced by the surface of the earth.",

The Doppler effect is where waves have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart (see the above annex, it occurs for EM waves and sound waves). It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. The Doppler effect occurs everywhere from astronomy (Redshift) to the sound of an ambulance passing us in the street. In aviation, we make use of the effect in modern Doppler VORs, GNSS systems and radars, for MTI (moving target indication) and turbulence detection. The best way to answer these questions is by thinking of a loud car (an ambulance with sirens on, a car honking its horn, etc.) going past you. The frequency (pitch) of the sound starts high, but decreases as the vehicle passes, and stays low whilst the vehicle is moving away. Therefore the frequency is increased when moving together, and reduced when moving apart.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.02: State that radio waves in LF, MF and HF propagate as surface/ground waves and sky waves. This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both surface waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere).",

Surface wave propagation exists at frequencies from about 20 kHz to about 50 MHz (from the upper end of VLF to the lower end of VHF). Surface waves are created due to diffraction. The portion of the wave in contact with the surface of the earth is retarded, which results in bending of the wave around the surface of the earth. The range of the surface waves is limited due to surface attenuation (the wave induces a voltage in the Earth, which takes energy away from it). Sky wave propagation exists at frequencies between 2 MHz to 30 MHz (from the upper end of MF to the whole HF range). Sky waves are radio waves that reach the ionosphere (an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere) and are reflected back toward the Earth. Since sky waves are not limited by the curvature of the Earth, sky wave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. For every frequency capable to create sky waves, there is an angle between the vertical and the radio wave known as critical angle ( above which total internal refraction occurs and the wave returns to the surface (first returning sky wave). At angles below critical, radio waves pass straight through ionosphere and outer space (they do not return on the surface of the earth). The distance from the transmitter to the point where the first returning sky wave appears at the surface is known as the skip distance. From the point where the surface wave is totally attenuated to the point where the first returning sky wave appears there will be no detectable signal. This area is known as dead space.",

There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 121.95 MHz, which is 121.95 x106 Hz or 121 950 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 121.95x106 = 2.46 m",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that, for our uses, HF transmissions are single side band (SSB).",

Please send us any further feedback if you do see this question, as we would certainly like to see if they change the options, or if they accept the appeal. We believe this question has already been appealed at least once, so hopefully it will soon be gone completely. NDBs (Non-Directional Beacons) emit their signals in the MF and LF frequency bands, which allows them to propagate as sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere) and surface waves (sticking to the ground). Surface waves stick to the surface of the Earth, in a strange fight between reflection, diffraction, and refraction with the charged surface of the Earth. They can propagate very far in the right conditions, and mostly maintain their direction over the Earth, other than when going from land to sea, where they shift direction as part of the \"coastal effect\". We can go through each option now to try and work out which could be most correct: \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the sky wave.\" This would give us a better chance of receiving a sky wave, as the angles would be shallower, so more chance of the waves \"bouncing\" off the ionosphere due to total internal refraction. However, the bouncing off the ionosphere introduces large changes of lateral direction, and we would not receive an accurate bearing, but we would receive a stronger bearing. We would argue that this is useless, as we use NDBs for navigation, so wildly inaccurate bearings are just as bad as no bearing at all. \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the ground wave.\" Ground waves run along the surface of the Earth, and hold their direction much better than sky waves, so this is how we usually pick up long range NDB bearings, however we do not believe that climbing higher will aid us to do this. \"Increase your distance from the NDB to better capture the ground wave.\" Ground waves have limited distance, the closer you are to the source, the better the reception, therefore this is wrong. \"Fly towards the NDB to better capture the sky wave.\" before the \"first skip\" distance of the sky wave, no sky wave will be present, and remember, we do not want to get a sky wave anyway, as it often has fading or is in the wrong direction, giving us a bad bearing. As you can see, there is no good answer here, and we believe that the assumption that you have to make to answer it is misleading.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question has been excluded from the RNAV database and relocated to subject 022 (022.13.03.01.02). Nevertheless, a student recently reported encountering it in their RNAV exam. If you come across this question in your RNAV exam, it is advisable to report it. A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation. APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a PLAN mode. This mode is easily identifiable thanks to the True North orientation symbol at the bottom of the ND and the fact that you cannot see weather radar indications on this mode. Only Figure 2 displays the MAP mode.",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct).",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Airborne weather radar is typically Xband, pulse modulated and operating in the 8-12 Ghz range with a wavelenght approx. 3 cm (remember well: 3 GHz -300GHz correspond ro a wavelenght of 10cm-1mm). The shape of the radar beam is very important in the design of a radar. For purposes of airborne weather radar, a narrow beam is the most desirable because it concentrates more energy on the target, which means more energy will come back in the echo. Flat Plate antennas are better than dish antennas and larger antennas are better than smaller antennas for concentrating the beam. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a radar will determine its maximum range. The PRF must be long enough to allow the echo pulses to return from the maximum range target. The longer the required range, the lower the PRF Scanning speed comes into play with the PRF since a high scanning speed and low PRF would cause targets to be missed. At least one pulse should be transmitted per a beam width of scan. Pulse width will determine the minimum range of the radar and also the resolution size of the target. If a target is close and the echo is reflected back to the radar while the transmitter pulse is still being transmitted, then obviously that target will be missed. Most radars I have worked with had a pulse width of less than 4 microseconds so this isn’t a problem. Also, many radars will shorten their pulse width in map mode allowing a higher degree of resolution for ground targets such as shorelines or islands.",

The loop antenna is a system which rotates and measures when a current output (due to the incoming NDB signals) occurs. Due to the vertical polarisation of NDB signals and the antenna rotation, there are 2 null points in the system (points of zero current), where the antenna is completely perpendicular to the incoming signals, giving us 2 potential relative bearings. The sense aerial then tells us which of the two points the NDB signal is coming from, and then this direction is outputted to an ADF indicator in the cockpit.",

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcast. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Refer to annex 1 Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. (annex2) Refer to annex 2 Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. A problem can occur called the night effect, which is most prominent during sunrise and sunset, where the changing sunlight modifies the ionisation of the ionosphere, and causes the sky waves to \"bounce off\" the ionosphere at sharper angles, greatly increasing the skip distance. This means that some radio waves that can travel as both ground waves and sky waves (such as the MF frequencies used in NDBs) can begin to interfere with each other. This interference is called \"fading\", and is because the two signals may; be out of phase from each other, have different polarities, or be arriving from different directions (particularly problematic for NDBs).",

            "explanation": "VHF (VERY HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION VHF communication channels is the standard means of voice communication in aviation. The VHF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 117.975 and 137 MHz. VHF communication is transmitted in the form of direct (space) waves. VHF radio waves propagation requires line-of-sight. This means that if there is mountainous terrain or obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, transmission will be interrupted. VHF propagation range is also limited by the height of the transmitter and the receiver, and the transmission power of the aircraft and the ground station. The theoretical maximum range of VHF propagation is given by the formula Range = 1.25(√HT + √HR), where HT is the height of the transmitter in feet, HR is the height of the receiver in feet and Range is in nautical miles. HF (HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION The HF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 2850 and 22 000 KHz. Voice communications via the HF frequency channels are used in areas where voice communication via the VHF channels becomes impractical. This happens when flying on North Atlantic Tracks (NAT) or across vast water bodies. HF radio frequencies enable communication over longer distances. HF transmitters use higher power outputs than VHF transmitters, increasing the range of their transmission. HF radio waves are propagated as sky waves, rising into the upper atmosphere and encountering ionosphere (an ionized layer of the atmosphere due to radiation from the Sun). Within the ionosphere, these waves refract sufficiently to return to Earth. This propagation path allows for an increase in the range of transmission of the HF radio waves when compared with the direct waves of VHF propagation path. Long distances over water do not allow for the presence of VHF ground transmitters, which means that the aircraft might be outside the maximum theoritical range of VHF communication. This is why HF is used instead.",

The most extreme case of \"slant range error\" occurs when the aircraft passes directly over the station; instead of reading zero, the DME shows the altitude of the airplane above the station (in nautical miles). Slant range error also affects groundspeed and time-to-station displays when you're close to the station. Displayed DME groundspeed drops below actual groundspeed as you approach the station and then climbs back to normal after you pass it. Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station. The DME range (slant range) can be calculated using the following formula: Slant Range = 1.23 (√H1 + √H2 ) H1 = altitude of the aircraft (ft) H2 = elevation of the DME station (ft) In our case: FL210 ft correspond at 21000ft Slant Range = 1.23 (√21000 + √0 ) Slant Range = 1.23 x 144.9 Slant Range = 178.2 NM With the aircraft at a distance of 220 NM we can say that at FL 210 it is beyond the maximum theoretical range or below the line of sight minimum altitude for this distance.",

The Earth’s surface over which the ground wave travels also has an impact on the range of an NDB. Multipath propagation phenomenon results in radio signals reaching the receiving antenna by two or more paths. This can result in a false indication of the ADF needle that points to the source of the reflection and not the NDB in use. The altitude at which the aircraft travels can also have an effect on the NDB range. For instance, in mountainous terrain, an NDB may not be received at low level but could be received higher up.",

DVOR: Doppler VOR is an evolution of CVOR, providing improved signal quality and accuracy by reducing scalloping error. The reference signal of DVOR is amplitude-modulated and the variable signal is frequency-modulated, exactly the opposite of CVOR. TVOR: Terminal VORs, as the name suggests, are located in terminal areas of aerodromes. These are power-limited to 50 W with a range of 25 NM. They often form part of departure and arrival structures. Therefore, these are normally positioned along the runway centreline. VOT: The VOT, or sometimes abbreviated as VORT, is a test VOR facility sometimesprovided at aerodromesand is not used for navigation. Pilots on the ground can tune in to this facility and check the receiver accuracy of the aircraft.",

DMEs can also provide groundspeed and time-to-station readouts by differentiation. The DME will measure the distance in a straight line to the ground beacon (the slant range), not the distance from a point on the ground vertically below the aircraft (ground range). The difference is generally insignificant, except that when directly over a beacon when the distance shown will be height above the beacon. DME operates in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band and the 252 available channels are contained between 960 and 1215 MHz. It utilises a double pulse in both the interrogator and the transponder. All pulses are the same duration, that is, 3.5 micro-seconds. Discrimination between channels is accomplished by both frequency separation and pulse spacing. Channels are numbered from 1 to 126 and each channel number is further divided into two channels designated ‘X’ and ‘Y’. Each numbered pair of channels is separated from the adjoining pair by 1 MHz. The ‘X’ channels are separated from the ‘Y’ channels by varying the pulse separation time. The pulse separation spacing is the same for all ‘X’ channels, being 12 micro-seconds for both the interrogator and the transponder. In the case of ‘Y’ channels the pulse spacing is 36 micro-seconds for the interrogator and 30 micro-seconds for the transponder.",

The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white )",

For an aircraft flying over the sea, the error puts the aircraft position closer to the coast than its actual position. The effect can be minimised by: Flying higher - a higher altitude minimises this coastal refraction effect. Using NDBs close to the coast - this reduces the effect of the error to the pilot, even though the waves bend just as much.

You can twist your paper to look in this direction for easiest understanding, you will want to be looking backwards down the 020 radial you drew earlier. As we have half scale \"fly right\" indication, which means 5º fly right to get onto the course, we can draw our aircraft as being 5º left of the selected inbound course, meaning that we are on radial 025. At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 210º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle on 025º, which is Figure D. Variation is not a factor as the CDI, RMI and VOR radials are all in magnetic.",

The coverage area for the approach direction as being within a sector of +/- 40° of the centre line out to a range of 20-30 NM from the threshold (according to ICAO Annex 10) The standard coverage area of the LOC and GP with angular sector limits in degrees and distance limits from the transmitter: LOC coverage area is 10° on either side of the centre line to a distance of 25 NM from the runway, and 35° on either side of the centre line to a distance of 17 NM from the runway; GP coverage area is 8° on either side of the centre line to a distance of minimum 10 NM from the runway. It operates in the SHF band 5 031 – 5 090.7 MHz, vertically polarised. This allows it to be positioned in hilly terrain without requiring the site to be leveled. Issues such as course deviation errors (bending) of the localizer and glide path, caused by aircraft, vehicles, and structures, are mitigated as the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted, thereby avoiding reflections. The localiser operates in the VHF band between 108 and 111.975 MHz. This part of the frequency band is shared with VOR: the LOC frequencies are odd decimals (e.g., 108.1 108.15; 108.3 108.35; 108.5 108.55 -111.95 MHz). The glide path operates in the UHF band between 329.15 and 335 MHz. The glide path frequency is paired with the localiser and selection of the frequency is automatic. The LOC and GP transmissions are frequency paired in accordance with the list published at ICAO.

The deviation detection of the aircraft from the desired track is based on two different overlapping lobes. These lobes are radiated by both the localiser and the glide path antennas. These consist of a 90 Hz lobe and a 150 Hz lobe. The equipment of an aircraft approaching for landing measures the difference in DDM of the two lobes and deflectes the localizer needle accordingly. For the localiser, stronger signals from the 90 Hz lobe means a displacement to the left. Whereas stronger signals from the 150 Hz lobe means a right displacement in relation to the centreline. When both the signals received are at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the centreline and the localiser needle will indicate zero. The Difference in Depth of Modulation (DDM) will vary proportionally and linearly with the angular displacement of the aircraft from the extended runway centerlinel. Assume that you are on the centreline, if you move away from the centrelline, however, still in the range of the localizer the DDM will increase. DDM = AM (90 hz) - AM (150 hz) / 100",

Now the VOR thinks that we want to fly that exact radial, but inbound to the beacon (we can therefore call it the \"048º TO\" course), so it is going to give us fly right/fly left indications from our current position (remember, it does not know our heading, it assumes we are heading in the correct direction). Therefore, a fly right indication means that we are to the left of that inbound track, so we are South-East of the \"048º TO\" course, which is the 228º radial.

The critical area is protected because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal-in-space; b) the ILS sensitive area is an area where the parking and/or movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.

            "explanation": "Very High Frequency Direction Finding (VDF) provides a means of determining the aircraft bearing from a ground station. VDF stations are capable of measuring the direction of arrival of radio transmissions from aircraft. Today, the service (for civil aviation) operates on frequencies from 118 to 137 MHz in the VHF band. These frequencies are identical with the working frequencies of the aircraft communication radio. One of the benefits of modern navigation and radio systems is that a pilot has the option of asking a suitably equipped ground station for his relative bearing to or from that particular ground station. This means that the pilot can determine his position (by using another VDF readout or NDB station) and heading more accurately should he become disorientated. Some aerodromes are equipped with radio aerials which can sense the direction of VHF-COM signals (i.e. normal voice signals) received from an aeroplane so the controller can then advise the pilot of his bearing relative to the aerodrome. An advantage of VDF is that no specific airborne equipment is required other than a VHF-COM, i.e. a normal VHF communications radio. A typical VDF air/ground exchange would be a pilot requesting ATC to provide his QDM (magnetic bearing to the ground station), followed by the controller advising it. By steering the QDM, the pilot is able to home to the ground station, i.e. head towards it. Consequently, ground stations that are equipped to provide VDF are designated by the term Homer. Whereas no special equipment is required in the aeroplane for VDF other than a VHF-COM radio, it does require a special installation at the ground station. Being a VHF transmission, the range is generally line of sight. The range will primarily depend on the height of the transmitter and the receiver. Some factors that will affect the expected range are: Intervening terrain that can screen the transmitter/receiver path Atmospheric refraction. An increased refractive index (resultant from the inversions of temperature and/or humidity) can cause super refraction and increased ranges. Transmitter power",

Learning Objective 062.02.02.05.02: State that static radiation energy from a cumulonimbus cloud may interfere with the radio wave and influence the ADF bearing indication. Thunderstorms can have very powerful discharges of static electricity across much of the electromagnetic spectrum including in Low Frequency (LF) and Medium Frequency (MF). These discharges cause the most severe errors in ADF receivers. A static discharge in a Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) can be heard as a loud crackle on the audio and the needle will move rapidly to the source of the CB. If there are several active thunderstorms in the area the needle might point to them for a longer period. As thunderstorms are incredibly powerful, the electromagnetic waves they give off can easily overpower that of an NDB, especially if it is only a low-power locator beacon.",

            "explanation": "To complete this question fully, you will need knowledge from many subjects. Thankfully, however, the answers have been made very far apart, which means that we can make some approximations along the way and still get the correct answer. This question has given us two locations with coordinates. With these types of questions, you must look for which coordinates are the same. In this case, the 036º15'S latitude is the same for both. Looking at the coordinates again, and remembering that 178ºE is actually to the West of 178ºW (as the 180ºE/W meridian lies close in between, where the E/W longitudes reverse, and start counting down the opposite hemisphere), the aircraft is directly West of the beacon*. The question asks for the direction the aircraft must fly for the DME groundspeed readout to read correctly. As the DME groundspeed readout uses \"rate of change of DME distance\" as the method for calculating groundspeed, then the only way for it to read correctly is by flying directly towards or directly away from the DME. Towards/Away from the VOR matters as well though, as the slant range becomes closer to the ground range the further we get from beacon, therefore it gets more accurate whilst flying away from the VOR. As the aircraft is directly True West from the beacon, then the aircraft would be flying on is whatever radial is True West of the VOR, so we must simply work out what magnetic radial corresponds to True West at the beacon. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 249º 21ºE (+) 270º We need to use the variation at the VOR as that is where the radial directions were decided, and emitted. Therefore, the aircraft must fly along radial 249º. *This is not strictly true, as VOR radials and DME pulses follow great circle tracks, and these include convergency due to the Earth's shape. The actual true radial outbound from the VOR would be 269º, making the final answer 248º in reality, but the answers give plenty of margin, and the question is much simpler without convergency.",

When on the approach, the sudden appearanc of both flags must mean a fault of some kind (not just being out of range), so this must be down to one of the faults listed in the learning objective above. The easiest fault to remember is correct in this case, as the sudden absence of a carrier wave is certainly going to remove LOC and GP indications and will therefore show warning flags. The other answers are wrong because: The difference in depth of modulation (DDM) is the way an ILS tells you where you are in relation to the localiser centreline or the glide path, and a DDM of zero means being exactly on the LOC or GP. \"Excessive LOC or GP deviations\" is vague, but even when at more than full scale deflection (but within the coverage area), the indicators still show the direction we are off track/glidepath. Loss of ident transmission would not show flags on its own, but there might be a common error which causes both flags to show and the ident to stop transmitting, such as a total power loss, etc.",

The pilot uses the ADF to determine the direction to the NDB relative to the aircraft. NDB's can be used to provide a non-precision approach to an airport. A pilot can make sure to be aligned with the correct approach path by maintaining the same QDM with the ADF, and can manage vertical guidance using their altimeter, with a minimum descent height/altitude. In terms of lateral errors permitted, flying an NDB approach, you must maintain a QDM/QDR that is ± 5° of the designated approach path. This is also the range in which an aircraft can be considered \"established\" on the approach. ICAO Doc 8 168 - Aircraft Operations The aircraft shall cross the fix or facility and fly outbound on the specified track, descending as necessary to the procedure altitude/height but no lower than the minimum crossing altitude/height associated with that segment. If a further descent is specified after the inbound turn, this descent shall not be started until the aircraft is established on the inbound track. An aircraft is considered established when it is: A) within half full scale deflection for the ILS and VOR; or B) within ±5° of the required bearing for the NDB.",

The heading does not matter here, as we are using a CDI (course deviation indicator), which has no heading input at all. If you need to imagine a heading, imagine that you are heading whatever the OBS course is set to, as that is how to find the most intuitive use of the CDI. We must work out which of the course lines we are closest to, and it is obvious that we are closer to the 150º radial, which we have called 330 TO. This means that the \"TO\" indication will be showing on our CDI. Now the CDI thinks we want to fly the 330 TO track towards the VOR, so at the moment we are right of track, therefore, the CDI will show a \"fly left\" indication. As we are more than 10º off the track radial, then the CDI will show full deflection \"fly left\".",

            "explanation": "Navigational NDBs have an unmodulated carrier wave (ICAO classification N0N). Station identification is transmitted at roughly ten second intervals. Older systems interrupt the carrier wave (Keying) to send an unmodulated (but also inaudible) morse code ident (classified as A1A). User will have also erratic indications while the signal is interrupted in this type of beacon. To make the unmodulated parts of the A1A signal audible, ADF equipment incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BF0) that produces a signal slightly removed from the received frequency that is then mixed with it. The mixing of the two frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, tahat is the difference of the two. In aircraft whit old ADF receivers the BFO mode is activated and annunciated when the “BFO” button is depressed, and permits the carrier wave and the associated Morse code identifier broadcast on the carrier wave to be heard. In modern FMS equipped aircraft whit modern ADF receiver, the BFO is automatically activated. Summary: selecting the BFO on makes the N0N carrier wave audible and allows the A1A type of ident to be heard. Note: BFO is not needed for an A2A signal which is already modulated to an audible frequency.",

However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. During the day, the D-layer of the ionosphere absorbs signals in the LF and MF bands. At night, the D-layer disappears, allowing the sky wave to interfere with the surface wave. This interference occurs due to the different paths taken by the sky wave and surface wave, as well as the induction of currents in the horizontal elements of the loop aerial. The contamination effect, which is observed as fading of the audio signal and the needle 'hunting', is most pronounced around dawn and dusk when the ionosphere is transitioning. At shorter distances (30 to 80 miles), the sky waves combine with the ground wave signal without any dead space. Since the sky waves travel a different path, they have a different phase compared to the ground wave. As a result, the aerial null signal is suppressed or displaced in a random manner, leading to wandering of the needle on the RMI or RBI. This effect is called fading and is most variable during twilight at dawn and dusk.",

The height of the aircraft above the DME is 8500 - 596 = 7904 ft. These numbers are the same so the ground distance is zero, and the aircraft is directly overhead the station.

Regarding the aircraft heading, the aircraft is going roughly in the same direction as the radial. The selected (red) course will be indicated on the HSI and will show a deflection to the left. Remember, the deflection needle tells where the aircraft is relative to the selected course.

When within the coverage area of the ILS, and receiving the ident, that means that the carrier wave for the correct LOC is definitely being received, but showing flags for both LOC and GS is not what you would expect in normal operation. When flags are shown, it is due to any of the items listed in the LO above, or possibly due to the received signal being below a certain strength. This narrows down the possible failures to a modulation problem. Also, the other possible answers are wrong as: selected course does not affect ILS signals or indication. Any more than full scale deflection (within the coverage area) shows exactly that, full scale deflection. An aircraft ahead of yours might cause a momentary change in the ILS indication due to signal reflection, but this woud be a tiny blip indeed.",

            "explanation": "Navigational NDBs have an unmodulated carrier wave (ICAO classification N0N). Station identification is transmitted at roughly ten second intervals. Older systems interrupt the carrier wave (Keying) to send an unmodulated (but also inaudible) morse code ident (classified as A1A). User will have also erratic indications while the signal is interrupted in this type of beacon. To make the unmodulated parts of the A1A signal audible, ADF equipment incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BF0) that produces a signal slightly removed from the received frequency that is then mixed with it. The mixing of the two frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, tahat is the difference of the two. Summary: selecting the BFO on makes the N0N carrier wave audible and allows the A1A type of ident to be heard. Note: BFO is not needed for an A2A signal which is already modulated to an audible frequency.",
