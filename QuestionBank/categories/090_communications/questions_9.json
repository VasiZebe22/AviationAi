During the radio wave travel, its energy is taken up by the ground or atmosphere (hail, ionosphere, rain, etc). This way the electromagnetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy. Consequently, the signal becomes weaker as energy is absorbed by the Earth, atmosphere or ionospheric layers.",

            "explanation": "The band normally used for Aeronautical Mobile Service (AMS) voice communication is defined between 118.000 and 136.975 MHz, which is a subpart of the VHF frequency band. At VHF frequencies and above, space wave propagation is achieved. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is: 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Shielding by parts of the aircraft: When aircraft parts are shielding the signals, the line of sight propagation is being interrupted and the signal might not reach the receiver antenna. Static interference: A significant amount of static electricity is produced in the atmosphere due to weather conditions, human activities, and geological processes. The impact of static interference is more pronounced at lower frequencies. However, at VHF and higher frequencies, the effect of this interference is usually minimal. Ionospheric refraction: During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Sky wave interferance: It is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. These sky waves cause interference to the original ground waves and are related to LF and MF bands.",

            "explanation": "A discrete VHF frequency shall, whenever practicable, be used for Voice-ATIS broadcasts. VHF is amplitude modulated direct (line of sight) waves - practically straight-line propagation. Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. The range of VHF propagation is the function of transmitter power: R = 2 x √P Where: R is the range [NM] P is the power [W] The maximum distance at which one may expect solid VHF contact: R = 1.23 x (√H + √h) Where: R is the range [NM] H is the height over terrain [ft] h is the elevation of the station] The actual range depends on the height of the antenna. Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb. Another point to note is that transmission reception is highly dependant upon line of sight. When we are flying around at 15 000 feet, there are very few obstructions that our transmissions have to deal with.",

We can say that attenuation is affected by a number of factors, including: The materials a signal travels through => the higher the density of the material – the higher the attenuation. Frequency and wavelength => higher frequencies and lower wavelengths suffer from higher attenuation – because they have a higher number of peaks which causes a higher number of energy fluctuations and energy loss over distance, being more prone to attenuation. SUMMARY: Attenuation increases as: air density increases wavelength decreases frequency increases air temperature decreases Note: with regards to the air, provided that pressure remains constant – the lower the temperature, the higher the density => attenuation increases with temperature decrease.",

The reception of VHF transmission is normally influenced by the level of aircraft and terrain elevations. VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication and unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area. VHF is also less affected by atmospheric noise. On the other hand, obstacles do impair the reception of VHF communications - the straight line joining the transmitter and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception, due to the presence of hills, mountains, bumps on the surface of the Earth and the roundness of the Earth itself. You may expect a solid reception when the aircraft is at high level in the vicinity of the ground station. Note: Curvature of the Earth limits effective range because VHF waves do not follow the Earth's curvature.",

The reception of VHF transmission is normally influenced by the level of aircraft and terrain elevations. VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication and unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area. VHF is also less affected by atmospheric noise. On the other hand, obstacles do impair the reception of VHF communications - the straight line joining the transmitter and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception, due to the presence of hills, mountains, bumps on the surface of the Earth and the roundness of the Earth itself. You may expect a solid reception when the aircraft is at high level in the vicinity of the ground station. Note: Duct propagation (super-refraction) increases the range of VHF transmissions and enables reception beyond the horizon.",

Airband is often used for referring to the VHF spectrum between 108 MHz and 137 MHz, which covers its use for commercial and general aviation, radio-navigational aids, air traffic control and other uses. In common use among aviation professionals, the range of frequencies is sometimes referred to as VHF or Victor. Military aircraft also operate using additional frequencies (225 - 400 MHz) which are not part of the airband. The lower part of the spectrum, from 108 to 117.975 MHz, is reserved for navigational aids such as VOR beacons and Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), and precision approach systems such as ILS or LAAS. Some types of aviation-related stations, such as NDBs and DMEs, do not operate on these frequencies; in the case of NDBs the longwave frequency spectrum is used. The rest of the airband (118 - 137 MHz) is allocated to voice communications using amplitude modulation. Channel spacing on the airband has been 25 kHz. However, increasing congestion has led to further subdivision into 8.33 kHz channels in the ICAO European region; all aircraft flying above 19 500 feet (FL195) are required to be capable of handling this reduced spacing. A switch to digital radios has been contemplated, as this would greatly increase capacity by reducing bandwidth. However, this has yet to happen, partly because the mobility of aircraft necessitates complete international cooperation.",

            "explanation": "VHF is amplitude modulated direct (line of sight) waves - practically straight-line propagation. Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. The range of VHF propagation is the function of transmitter power: R = 2 x √P Where: R is the range [NM] P is the power [W] The maximum distance at which one may expect solid VHF contact: R = 1.23 x (√H + √h) Where: R is the range [NM] H is the height over terrain [ft] h is the elevation of the station] The actual range depends on the height of the antenna. Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb. Another point to note is that transmission reception is highly dependant upon line of sight. When we are flying around at 15 000 feet, there are very few obstructions that our transmissions have to deal with.",

The AMS refers to VHF and HF voice communication. The VHF propagation is practically straight-line propagation (similar to light waves). Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. Channel spacing in the airband has been 25 kHz.

Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb.

If a discrete frequency is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel(s) of the most appropriate terminal navigation aid(s), preferably a VOR, provided the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the navigation aid is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated. ATIS is transmitted on a VHF frequency channel. VHF radio waves are transmitted as space waves (direct waves) and require line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. This means that transmission is by straight line, or direct wave, and no obstacles should exist between the transmitter and the receiver. Uneven terrain, intervening high ground, mountains, man-made structures etc., cause VHF signal to be stopped, reflected, or bent, affecting its reception. Climbing to a higher level ensures no obstacles exist between the transmitter and the receiver, allowing line of sight transmission. Maximum VHF theoretical reception range (NM) = 1.23 × (√h1 + √h2) where h1 = receiver height in feet AMSL, and h2 = transmitter height in feet AMSL. Therefore, when the receiver height increases, the VHF reception range increases as well. Climbing at a higher altitude ansures line of sight and increases the ATIS VHF reception range.",

The straight line joining the sender and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception (because of mountains, hills, etc).",

However, during certain weather conditions, the “lost” signal can be bent back towards earth and received much further away than normal. Potentially, this signal can travel greater distances. This is called super refraction or atmospheric ducting. When refraction is less than normal then it is called sub-refraction. What causes atmospheric ducting? Ducts need a marked temperature and a rapid decrease in humidity with height. Normally, the higher you go into the atmosphere, the colder it is. However, high pressure can cause a temperature inversion. This is where a layer of air in the troposphere will be at a higher temperature than the layer below it. Some of the radio signals from a transmitter bounce back towards the ground and potentially up again. The inversion effectively creates a duct for signals to travel along.",

The outcome of this analysis is that the further away one is from the Earth's surface, least attenuation will be experienced. Therefore, the best answer is air to air at 30 000 ft.",

Frequency and wavelength => higher frequencies and lower wavelengths suffer from higher attenuation – because they have a higher number of peaks which causes a higher number of energy fluctuations and energy loss over distance, being more prone to attenuation. SUMMARY: Attenuation increases as: air density increases wavelength decreases frequency increases air temperature decreases Note: with regards to the air, provided that pressure remains constant – the lower the temperature, the higher the density => attenuation increases with a temperature decrease.",

The navigation aids transmit their identifiers continuously - a navigation aid which isn't transmitting its identifier cannot be used. The morse code identifier can be found inside the navaid symbol on the chart - you should always check that the tunes being transmitted match the ones indicated in the chart.

            "explanation": "The band normally used for Aeronautical Mobile Service (AMS) voice communication is defined between 118.000 and 136.975 MHz (VHF band). The AMS refers to VHF and HF voice communication (the latter being the most used, whereas HF is only used for long range flights). The VHF propagation is practically straight-line propagation (similar to light waves). Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use.

Frequency and wavelength => higher frequencies and lower wavelengths suffer from higher attenuation – because they have a higher number of peaks which causes a higher number of energy fluctuations and energy loss over distance, being more prone to attenuation.

Report one of the following phenomena encountered or observed: • moderate turbulence as “TURBULENCE MODERATE” severe turbulence as “TURBULENCE SEVERE” The following specifications apply: Moderate — Conditions in which moderate changes in aircraft attitude and/or altitude may occur but the aircraft remains in positive control at all times. Usually, small variations in airspeed. Changes in accelerometer readings of 0.5 g to 1.0 g at the aircraft’s centre of gravity. Difficulty in walking. Occupants feel strain against seat belts. Loose objects move about. Severe — Conditions in which abrupt changes in aircraft attitude and/or altitude occur; aircraft may be out of control for short periods. Usually, large variations in airspeed. Changes in accelerometer readings greater than 1.0 g at the aircraft’s centre of gravity. Occupants are forced violently against seat belts. Loose objects are tossed about.",
