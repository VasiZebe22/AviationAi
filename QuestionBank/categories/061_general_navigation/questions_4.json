If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM. If so, 2 NM off-track must equate to a 6° drift angle and 3 NM off-track must equate to a 9° drift angle. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which has a drift angle of 4° after 60 NM, will be 4 NM off-track. Thus, after 24 NM, the aircraft will have a cross-track error of: 4° x 24 / 60 NM = 1.6 NM",

The primary source for directions inside a cockpit is the magnetic compass and he will align itself with the Magnetic North Pole and not with the True North Pole, those are not co-located. Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.

Set True Heading (020ºM) under \"True Index\" 2. Place centre dot over TAS (260 kts) 3. Mark the point where drift (10ºL) and GS (228 kt) meet. 4. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. 5.

Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (260 - 206 = 54 kt) W/V = 068º M / 54 kt => The question asks for W/V in (ºT), therefore we must apply the variation: Magnetic versus True Use this mnemonic to remember that with variation west, the magnetic direction is going to be \"best\" or greater than true. Variation is added to true to arrive at magnetic, or subtracted from magnetic to get true. 068ºM - 20ºW = 048ºT W/V = 048ºT / 54 kt",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

Learning Objective 061.01.07.01.02: Evaluate the difference between a DR and a fix position. The pilot expects the aircraft to be tracking the 320º radial, but finds out that the aircraft has actually tracked 323º from the VOR. This is 3º to the right, and that means that this could be due to a lesser crosswind component than forecast, given the wind from the right and from behind. It could also be due to a different headwind/tailwind component, but this can be discounted by calculating the distance versus the expected distance travelled. The pilot expects to fly at 158 kt groundspeed with the forecast wind, and has flown for 30 minutes outbound from KOK VOR. Therefore the pilot expects to be at 158/60 x 30 = 79 nm from the DME, and this is almost exactly correct. Therefore, the tailwind component has been the same. This means that the lesser crosswind is certainly what has caused the drift off track.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever. LO 061.01.03.01.05: Explain changes of variation with time and position.",

If the track error is larger, the error will be proportionally larger, so 60 NM along track a 2o track error will place you 2 NM off track, or 1 NM off track after 30 NM. The rule can be used to determine the track error angle,when the displacement is known, the displacement, when the track is known and correction to intercept, when displacement is known. The correction that must be made to intercept the DET VOR is given by the following formula, which is based on the 1:60 rule: (Distance off track / Miles to go) = (Degrees to intrercept / 60). Solving for Degrees to intercept we get: Degrees to intercept = (Distance off track x 60) / Miles to go = (2.5 NM x 60) / (27 NM - 15 NM) = 12.5o. Thus, since the aircraft is off-track to the left, the correction that must be made to arrive at DET VOR must be to the right, and its magnetic heading must be: Planned Magnetic Heading from M20 junction to DET VOR + Degrees to intercept = 283o (M) + 12.5o = 295.5o, which is very close to 296o.",

Therefore, the distance to go is 15 NM (50 NM - 35 NM). TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 5° + 12° = 17º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track).

Effects of Cold Temperature on Baro-vertical Navigation (VNAV) Vertical Guidance Non-standard temperatures can result in a change to effective vertical paths and actual descent rates when using aircraft baro-VNAV equipment for vertical guidance on final approach segments. A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate. Pilots should consider potential consequences of these effects on approach minima, power settings, sight picture, visual cues, etc., especially for high-altitude or terrain-challenged locations and during low-visibility conditions.",

However, based on the information provided in the question (RMI Deviation), we can infer that the RMI readings will be relative to Compass North. Given that the ADF is tuned to an NDB, the ADF needle on the RMI works as follows: The Tip of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing to the NDB (300°). The Tail of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing from the NDB (120°). In this case, we assume that the RMI is subjected to electromagnetic interference and therefore, deviation is applied: -2ºW (westerly deviation) ⇒ Compass North is 2° West of Magnetic North. Let’s start by converting compass heading to magnetic heading: Deviation west, compass best; Deviation east, compass least Magnetic Bearing to the NDB = Compass Bearing to the NDB - 002° = 300° - 002° = 298° Since the question asks for true bearing, we need to correct for magnetic variation: Variation west, magnetic best; Variation east, magnetic least. Remember that for NDB/ADF bearings the bearings are taken at the aircraft, therefore the magnetic variation applicable at the aircraft's position is to be used: Variation at the DR position = 22° West ⇒ Magnetic North is 22° West of True North True Bearing to the NDB = Magnetic Bearing to the NDB - 022° = 298° - 022° = 276°",

Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082°T. Variation is 001°W, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082°T+ 1° = 083° M(Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM. Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.",

With this information, we are able to determine the actual GS: 75 NM ÷ 0.677 h = 110.8 kt Now that we know the actual GS (110.8 kt), we can calculate the time it will take to cover 250 NM: 250 NM ÷ 110.8 kt = 2.26 h (2 h 15 min) The aircraft departs A at 09:00 UTC, therefore the revised ETA at destination equals: 09:00 UTC + 2 h 15 min = 11:15 UTC",

First we need to find out the wind information, using the flight computer: 1. Course/track aligns with the TRUE HEADING on the wind side of the flight computer (090º). Central grommet on the ground speed (290º). 2. The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value than the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. 3. Maintaining the central grommet over the G/S line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS (250 kt) and make a pencil mark (10ºL). 4. Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centreline between the grommet and the true index. 5. Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark (60 kt). 6. Read the true wind direction under the true index (315º). Now that we've determined the wind speed and angle, we can apply the formula: Crosswind Component (XWIND) = Wind Speed × sin (Wind Angle) Given a heading of 080º and a wind angle of 315º, the difference is 235º. Crosswind Component (XWIND) = 60 × sin (235º) = −49.15 kt Since the heading is 080º and the tracking is 090º, it's evident that the wind is from the left and on the tail, therefore it is blowing the aircraft to the right: 49 kt right. The wind is from the left and on your tail, therefore it is blowing you to the right.",

We can use the \"drift\" value in the wind calculation instead of the track, so there's no need to work out the track here. The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (high speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (North) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (500 kt) under the central point Place a dot where the relevant drift line (12ºL) meets the groundspeed (550 kt). (we have shown a line from the centre to this point for easier viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top. The wind speed is the amount of knots the line or dot is below the centre point (500 kt - 380 kt = 120 kt in this case). True wind velocity = 108º(T)/120 kt Closest Answer = 109º/120 kt",

The difference between the direction of magnetic north and that of compass north is called \"deviation\". Deviation is measured in degrees and is described as \"East\" (+) or \"West\" (-).

The highest speed of the Earth in its orbit is at perihelion, the lowest at aphelion. Perihelion occurs in early January and Aphelion in early July. These differences in range are not enough to cause the seasons, but these come from the Earth's tilt or, using astronomic terminology, the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic (where ecliptic, the name given to the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere). When the northern hemisphre is tilted most towards the Sun, it experiences northern hemisphere summer. When it tilts most away, it is northern hemisphere winter, but southern hemisphere summer.",

The horizontal component is the part which is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles. As you approach the poles, the angle between magnetic flux and the horizon becomes vertical – compass ‘dip’ becomes a factor => decrease in horizontal magnetic field, increase in vertical magnetic field. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator (=midway between the two poles). A freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

Using your Flight/Nav computer find the TAS at FL140: In the airspeed correction window set the temperature -13°C against 14 000 ft. Above CAS 220 kt (22) on the inner scale, read the TAS 273 kt to be considered for dead reckoning during climb on the outer scale.",

Radials are magnetic bearings emanated from VORs, so a 360o radial has a northerly magnetic direction. 090° true course means that the aircraft flies eastwards and almost along the same parallel of latitude. Thus, its latitude (53°04'N) remains constant, when it crosses the R360 BUN. Variation is 0o, so R360 coincides with the true meridian 004°50'E, which passes through the BUN VOR. The range between the aircraft crossing R360 BUN and BUN VOR is equal to their the Change of Latitude. So, applying the rule \"Same hemispheres, Subtract\", the Change of Latitude along the true meridian or R360 is: 53o04’N - 51o07’N = 1o 57’ or 117’. We know, also, that \"Along a meridian, 1’ corresponds to 1NM\". Therefore, the range of the aircraft from the BUN VOR when crossing R360 is 117NM.",

For a spherical Earth, latitude and longitude are angles seen from the center of the Earth and only for the longitude is the exactly the same as for an ellipsoid Earth. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic longitude is defined as \"The angular distance between the prime meridian and another meridian passing through a point on the Earth's surface\" or \"The angle in the equatorial plane between the line a that connects the Earth's centre with the prime meridian and the line b that connects the centre with the meridian on which the point lies\".

Thereafter, we are expected to find the new groundspeed required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Lastly, we will convert it back to IAS and determine the reduction. Step-by-step solution: (1) Determine TAS from IAS: First Step (1): Use the “AIR SPEED” window. Align 14 000 ft with -5ºC. Second Step (2): Find IAS 210 kt (inner scale, outer ring) and read the corresponding value of TAS 264 kt (outer scale). (2) Knowing the wind component and TAS, we can determine the ground speed: Wind component: -35 kt TAS: 264 kt Groundspeed = 264 kt – 35 kt = 229 kt (3) Calculate the time it would take to cover 150 NM at 229 kt: Time = Distance ÷ Speed Time = 150 NM ÷ 229 kt Time = 39.3 min (4) However, the aircraft is required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Therefore, we need to find the revised time: Revised time = 39.3 min + 5 min = 44.3 min (5) Determine the new groundspeed to meet the delay restriction: Groundspeed = (150 NM / 44.3 min) x 60 min = 203 kt (6) Considering the wind component and the groundspeed, calculate the revised TAS: Revised TAS = 203 kt + 35 kt = 238 kt (7) Determine IAS from TAS: First Step (1): Use the “AIR SPEED” window. Align 14 000 ft with -5ºC. Second Step (2): Find TAS 238 kt (outer scale) and read the corresponding value of IAS 188 kt (inner scale, outer ring). Reduction in IAS = initial IAS – new IAS Reduction in IAS = 210 kt – 188 kt = 22 kt",

Track is lower than heading, meaning it's a left drift (8ºL). Determine W/V (CRP5 method): 1. Set True Heading (090ºT) under \"True Index\" 2. Place centre dot over TAS (460 kts) 3.

(2) Find out True Track and Drift using the flight computer: Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (180 kt). Place wind direction (310°) under the true index Mark wind velocity downwards from the centre. It can be done from arbitrary positions, only magnitude is important. When the question provides a track → mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the Heading is known → mark wind velocity downwards from centre. Place your true heading (220°) under the true index. Read the Groundspeed of 184 kt and a drift of 8°L. (3) Calculate True Track using Heading and Drift The drift is the angle difference from the Heading to the Track, so a 8° left drift means that the Track should have a direction 8° less than the Heading. This only applies if they are using the same datum, so both Magnetic, both True, etc. True Track = 220° - 8° = 212°",

            "explanation": "There are two possible answers for this question. However, the option \"By selecting a suitable echo from the display, obtaining the relative bearing and distance, and converting it into a true bearing to plot on the chart.\" has been confirmed by feedback to be correct in official exams. The pilot may take a relative bearing from an AWR display and would then use the aircraft heading to turn the relative heading into a magnetic or true bearing to. Thereafter, the reciprocal from the ground feature can be back-plotted as true or magnetic. On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

If we assume an equal change of wind direction and speed per 1 000 ft, we can say that he wind direction increases by 1.66° / 1 000 ft (30° within 18 000 ft) and 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft (30 kt within 18 000 ft). W/V used for climb problems is the WV at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. W/V used for descent problems is the WV at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The altitude change in the climb is 20 000 - 2 000 = 18 000 ft. 2 / 3 x 18 000 ft = 12 000 ft. 12 000 ft through the climb occurs at 2 000 + 12 000 = 14 000 ft. Therefore, 14 000 ft will be 14 000 - 2 000 ft = 12 000 ft higher than 2 000 ft. Wind direction at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66° / 1 000 ft = 20° higher than wind direction at 2 000 ft. Wind speed at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft = 20 kt higher than wind speed at 2 000 ft. Consequently, at 14 000 ft wind is 280° + 30° = 300° and wind speed is 20 + 20 = 40 kt. CAS = 220 kt “To find TAS, add 2% to the CAS for every 1 000 ft of altitude.” TAS = CAS + 2% CAS x (Altitude) / 1 000 ft = 220 + 2% 220 x 14 000 / 1 000 = 282 kt Determining G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (282 kt). (2) Place wind direction (300º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (40 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (225°) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (282 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 269 kt; → the closest option is 264 kt",

Therefore, we need to find the TAS for the aircraft at 14 000 ft, with OAT = ISA -15ºC and a CAS of 150 kt. Calculating TAS using a suitable flight computer (We have used a CRP-5). First, calculate the OAT: The ISA temperature at 14 000 ft = 15 - 2(14) = -13ºC. The OAT is ISA - 15ºC, so OAT = -13 - 15 = -28ºC On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 14 000 ft with the OAT of -28ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 150 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 181 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is under 300 kt, there is no need to make a compressibility correction. Therefore, the average TAS to be used for climb calculations is 181 kt",

            "explanation": "No calculations are required for this question, because it asks for TAS and CAS “at some point during climb” and not at a specific altitude during descent. A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During descent with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 274 kt and a TAS of 416 kt, at a lower altitude during the descent, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and CAS higher than 274 kt and 416 kt correspondingly, is CAS: 324 kt and TAS: 430 kt.

The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively).

Initially, set the True Track to 340º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 12ºL drift and a track of 328º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 340º. This occurs at a heading of 352º with 13ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 89 kt. Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (+)13ºR WCA",

Drift is the angle difference from heading to track The aircraft flies along the radial 310° inbound a VOR, then its magnetic track is: 310° - 180° = 130°M. And since it drifts by 10oR, then its magnetic heading is: 130°M - 10o = 120oM. For this question using your Navigation/Flight computer, apply the following steps: Place the centre dot over the TAS 480 kt. Set the Magnetic heading 120o under the True Index. Put a mark where the 10o starboard drift and the Groundspeed 415 kt coincide. Rotate the circular bezel until the mark you have made is exactly below the centre dot on the 0o drift line. The magnetic wind direction is shown under the True Index 075o (M). The wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot and the value under the mark: 480 kt - 380 kt = 100 kt. Therefore, the magnetic wind direction and speed is: 075°(M)/100 kt. E6-B Flight Computer Procedure: We are given a GS of 415 kt and TAS of 480 kt, however the wind speed on the slide reaches a maximum of about 264 kt, we can still use the E6-B flight computer following these steps: If your E6-B flight computer includes a high-speed side, you can skip the following steps and proceed directly to the procedure below using the given GS and TAS values. Divide the GS and TAS by 5: GS: 415 kt / 5 = 83 kt TAS: 480 kt / 5 = 96 kt Now, with GS = 83 kt and TAS = 96 kt, proceed as follows: Multiply the calculated (steps below) wind velocity by 5. Calculation of Magnetic Wind Direction and Velocity: Position the slide until the ring aligns with the speed arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (83 kt). Rotate the transparent disk to align the Magnetic Track (130°) under the TRUE INDEX. Determine the Wind Correction Angle (WCA): With a Drift angle of 10° to the right, WCA = 10° left. With the ring on the Ground Speed (83 kt) arc, mark the point where the 10° left WCA intersects the True Airspeed (96 kt) arc. Rotate the transparent disk until the mark aligns with the centerline, ABOVE the ring, between the ring and the TRUE INDEX. Count the lines between the ring and the mark to determine the Wind Velocity. In this case, with the ring on the 83 kt arc and the mark on the 103 kt arc, Wind Velocity = 100 kt (103 - 83 = 20, 20 x 5 = 100). Read the Magnetic Wind Direction under the TRUE INDEX. In this case, the value is 075°, resulting in Magnetic Wind Direction = 075°.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.

Wind information given by the tower is already magnetic and the runway is also magnetic, no need to apply variation. The wind velocity is made of two components, one acting along the runway called the headwind component, and the other acting across the runway called the crosswind component. It is possible to calculate the crosswind component taking the sine and the cosine of the relative bearing between the runway and the wind direction. Head/Tail wind component = Wind Speed x cosine (Relative Bearing) Crosswind component = Wind Speed x sine (Relative Bearing) Wind information given by the tower is already magnetic and the runway is also magnetic, no need to apply variation.

Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic longitude is defined as \"The angular distance between the prime meridian and another meridian passing through a point on the Earth's surface\" or \"The angle in the equatorial plane between the line a that connects the Earth's centre with the prime meridian and the line b that connects the centre with the meridian on which the point lies\".

            "explanation": "Radial is a magnetic bearing extending from a VOR/VORTAC/TACAN. Drift is the angle difference from the aircraft’s heading to its actual track (track made good). When tracking inbound on Radial 325°, then its magnetic track is: 325°M - 180° = 145°M. Thus, its true track is: 145°M + 8° = 153°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 10° right, its heading is: 153°T - 10° = 143°T. When tracking outbound on Radial 075°, then its magnetic track is 075°M and its true track: 075°M + 8 = 083°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 10° right, its heading is: 083°T - 10° = 073°T. A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 150 kt and put true heading 143°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 10° right drift. Now put the next heading 073°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 10° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 028°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (150) and the value under the drift lines intersection (118): 150 kt - 118 kt = 32 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 028°/32 kt.",

When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre.

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (3/60) x 60 = 3º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (3/60) x 60 = 3º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 3º + 3º = 6º R The aircraft is left off-track, the aircraft must fly right to regain track.",

In these cases, the TAS and W/V to use on the Flight/Nav computer is as follows: For Climb problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The aircraft climbs from MSL (0 ft) to FL270. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: 0 ft + [2/3 x (27 000)] ft = 18000 ft For the wind velocity at 18 000 ft then, we would usually have to interpolate 3/5ths of the way from 15 000 ft to 20 000 ft, but the winds are the same so no interpolation necessary. We can use the wind velocity 310º(T)/45 kt. For OAT, the ISA temperature at 18 000 ft is 15 - 2(18) = -21ºC, and the OAT is ISA +5ºC, so OAT = -16ºC To find the groundspeed, we first needs to calculate the TAS. (We have used a CRP-5 and the wind-down method here) On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 18 000 ft with the OAT of -16ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 280 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 373 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is over 300 kt, this needs to be corrected. In the COMP. CORR. window, calculate and apply the small correction in the direction of the arrow (only 0.7 divisions). Go back to the CAS of 280 kt on the inner scale, and read off the new TAS of 369 kt on the outer scale. The Groundspeed can be found using the wind side of the computer. Set wind direction 310ºT under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the centre point on the TAS of 369 kt * Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially set the True Track 045°T under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would give 6º drift and a track of 051º, so reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 045º. This occurs at a heading of 038º with 7º Right drift. The groundspeed of this track is approximately 370 kt Therefore the average groundspeed for the climb is 370 kt, closest answer 371 kt. *Note: If your flight computer does not include high speeds, set 269 kt or 169 kt at the center point as TAS (TAS - 100 kt or TAS - 200 kt) and follow the rest of the procedure. At the final Ground Speed result you will need to add the 100 kt or 200 kt that you subtracted from TAS.",

Using drift angle and heading, determine track: Drift angle is how many degrees the heading is to the right or left of the track.

            "explanation": "The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to its orbital elliptical path around the Sun at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth's equator is 23.5o. The Sun will be exactly overhead 23.5o N in June, when \"the northern hemisphere summer solstice\" takes place and we have the longest day. Also, it will be overhead 23.5o S in December, when \"the northern hemisphere winter solstice\" will take place and we will have the longest night. The latitudes 23.5o N and 23.5o S are called the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively and represent the highest latitudes where the Sun will be directly overhead. The tilt of the Earth's axis is responsible for the longer nights in winter and the longer days in summer. It also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. Between the solstices are the Equinoxes, when the Sun is passing over the Equator, where night and day are of equal length. The equinoxes are the times when the relative length of night and day and the elevation of the noon sun, known as the declination of the Sun, are changing at the greatest rate. If you consider the time of sunrise at different points on the Earth's surface, it quickly becomes clear that the Sun rises at different times at different longitudes, because of the rotation of the Earth and different latitudes, because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively).",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

True direction (T) Variation (V) Magnetic direction (M) 105º 15ºE 090º Wind Correction Angle of +13º implies a correction to the right, resulting in a Wind Correction Angle of 13º Right. This adjustment shifts the True Heading to the right of the True Track by 13º. Therefore, the True Heading can be determined by adding 13º to the True Track True Heading = True Track + 013º = 105º + 013º = 118º. Follow the steps detailed below in order to find unknown wind (CRP-5 method): Adjust the slide until the centre dot aligns with the arc corresponding to True Airspeed (465 kt). Rotate the window disc to position the True Heading (118º) beneath the TRUE HEADING index. Calculate the Drift Angle. With True Track at 105º, derive Drift Angle as 13º Left (Port) from the window disc. Identify the point on the slide where the Left Drift Angle of 13º intersects the arc for Ground Speed (480 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline BELOW the center dot. Determine Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the vector between the center dot and the pencil mark. In this case, with the center dot on the 465 arc and the pencil mark on the (approximately) 357 kt arc, the Wind Velocity is approximately 108 kt (465 - 357 = 108). Read the (True) Wind Direction below the TRUE HEADING index. With the value 209 below the TRUE HEADING index, ascertain that the (True) Wind Direction is 209º.",

Thus, for a climb gradient of 6.6% and a Groundspeed of 180 kt, the Rate of Climb will be: Rate of Climb (ft/min) = 6.6 % x 180 kt x 6080 / 6000 = 1 204 ft/min, which is very close to 1 188 ft/min.",

NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre.

In this case, we can read a GS of approximately 369 kt. 6) Now, we can determine the drift angle. The end of the like is approximately at 5º Right, meaning that our drift angle equals approximately 5ºR. Please note that drift angle is simply \"how many degrees\" the Track is to the left or right of the Heading. If the Track is to the Left of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Left. If the Track is to the Right of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Right. Considering the above statement, we can conclude that the track equals 186º (TH + Drift = 181º + 5º = 186º)",

Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring, where the pilot must be able to visualise the terain and physical features from symbols on the map. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. The choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. The rule for choosing a ground feature is to find something as unique as possible, such as masts, railways, rivers, bridges, etc. Also, the map to ground technique is recommended to avoid confirmation bias, for instance spotting a tower on the ground and convincing yourself that it is the church tower you would dearly like it to be on the map. For this question, the pilot chose ground features (towers, villages) as turning points, which are identical with many others and can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. Also, VFR navigation at lower levels, as in our case 1500 ft above ground, restricts the view ahead and around by the next fold of high ground and objects may only appear when you are close to them and when they are not obscured by high ground. Probably, the pilot changed course at a wrong village, because of his/her low cruise altitude and not recommended ground features choice.",

Set the True Heading 301° under the True Index. Since the aircraft has a True Track 309° and has a True heading of 30°, it has experienced a drift of: 309° - 301° = 8°R. Remember that \"Drift is the angle difference from heading to track\". Put a mark where the 8°R drift and the Groundspeed 139 kt coincide. Rotate the circular bezel until the mark you have made is exactly below the centre dot on the 0° drift line. The wind direction is shown under the True Index 236° (T). The wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot and the value under the mark: 147 kt - 125 kt = 22 kt. Therefore, the true wind direction and speed is: 236°(T)/22 kt.

This exercise is asking us to determine the actual wind, and we will solve it using with the flight computer. To determine the actual wind we need the information related to actual path of aircraft over the ground, G/S and actual track and as well the TAS and actual heading information. Based on the forecasted wind, and using the flight computer we can determine the aircraft planned heading and G/S. Solving from Heading (HDG), knowing WV, TAS and required track. Set wind direction to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 190 kt. Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 355º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 7ºR drift and a track of 362º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 355º. This occurs at a heading of 348º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 186 kt. At a ground speed of 186 kt, after 30 min of flight, the distance covered should be 93 NM. However, according to the question text, tha aircraft is 4.5 NM ahead = 97.5 NM. Therefore, the actual ground speed = 97.5 NM x 2 = 195 kt To determine the actual track over the ground, we will calculate the actual TKE and add it to the planned track. TEK = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TEK = ( 3,5 / (93 + 4,5) ) x 60 = 2ºR 2º right means that the actual track of the aircraft over the ground is 355º + 2º = 357º Knowing the GS 195 kt, TAS 190 kt, heading 348º and track 357º, it is possible to determine the actual wind using the flight computer by following the steps below: Determining winds with the flight computer: Set True Heading (348ºT) under \"True Index\" Place centre dot over TAS (190 kts) Mark the point where drift (9ºR) and GS (195 kt) meet. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (253º) Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (190 - 160 = 30 kt) Actual W/V = 253º / 30 kt",

With the data given, we cannot find the W/V at 4 000 ft and interpolate with the W/V at 8 000 ft for the 2/3 of the cruising altitude, but we can find through the flight/nav computer, the GS at 8 000 ft and interpolate with the GS given at 4 000 ft for the 2/3: Set wind direction to 200º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 240 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 259º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 241º with 8ºR drift. The groundspeed at 8 000 ft for this track is approximately 208 kt. 3. After interpolation, the GS at 2/3 of the cruising altitude (6 667 ft) is: 213 kt. 4. The time to climb from 4 000 ft to 8 000 ft is: Height difference / ROC = (8 000 ft - 4 000 ft) / 1 600 fpm = 2.5 min. 5. The Ground distance covered during the climb is: GS x Time = 213 kt x 2.5/60 hr = 8.87 NM.(8.7 is the closest)",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of GNAV, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their General Navigation exam.",

            "explanation": "Note: This should not be a GNAV question. Density altitude is not particularly important to GNAV specifically, and calculating it is not part of the GNAV learning objectives, so you should appeal this question if you see it in a GNAV exam. Feedback from one authority shows that has been seen in this exam. Density altitude is a measure of the environmental air density, in comparison to where you would find that same density in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), so you end up with an altitude measurement. A high density altitude means low air density, and a low density altitude means high air density (what you would get at low-level). Density altitude can be calculated in 2 main ways, by flight computer or by mathematical calculation. By flight computer (CRP-5) it is relatively simple, in the \"AIR SPEED\" window, line up the pressure altitude with the OAT, and read off the density altitude in the \"DENSITY ALTITUDE\" window (x1000 ft). In this case, you get just under 9000 ft, but this is not the most accurate measurement in the world. We could show a picture in the annex, but flight computers are each very slightly different, so different answers could easily be found on different computers. By mathematical calculation, you take the pressure altitude, and adjust it for temperature by 120 ft per °C different from ISA. As high temperature is lower density, this means that higher than ISA temperature means a higher density altitude, and lower than ISA temperature means a lower density altitude. ISA temperature at 5500 ft (FL55) is 15 - 2(5.5) = 4°C, so with an OAT of +33°C, we are at ISA +29°C, meaning our density altitude is higher than our pressure altitude. The difference is 120 ft/°C x 29°C = 3480 ft, so the Density altitude is 5500 + 3480 = 8980 ft, closest answer 9000 ft",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 150 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 266º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 274º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 160 kt. It is normal during flight that the track over the ground is different from the desired trajectory defined during planning. If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 GS = 160 kts Planned track distance flown = 160 x 15’ = 40 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 NM.

            "explanation": "Radial is a magnetic bearing extending from a VOR/VORTAC/TACAN. Drift is the angle difference from the aircraft’s heading to its actual track (track made good). When following a magnetic track of 250°M, its true track is: 250°M + 10°E = 260°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 8° Left, its heading is: 260°T + 8° = 268°T. When following a magnetic track of 340°M, its true track is: 340°M + 10°E = 350°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 8° Right, its heading is: 350°T - 8° = 342°T. A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 180 kt and put true heading 268°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 8° left drift. Now put the next heading 342°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 8° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 305°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (180) and the value under the drift lines intersection (144): 180 kt - 144 kt = 36 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 305°/ 36 kt.",

Use the formula: ROD = (height difference x GS) / (Distance x 60) ROD = (24 000 x 335) / (100 x 60) ROD = 1 340 ft/min Alternatively, Distance = GS x Time 100 NM = 335 kt x Time Time = 17.91 min We have 17.91 min to descend 24 000 ft: 24 000 ft /17.91 min = 1 340 ft/min",

Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is the highest Latitude listed below at which the sun will rise above the horizon and set every day\" is 64º. However, according to feedback, it seems that there is a question where the option “64º” is not available. In such case, we have received feedback which confirms the correct option to be “62º”. At the moment, there might be 2 different versions of this question (yet to be confirmed): When the options available include 62º and 64º, the correct option is 64º. When the options available include 62º and all remaining options are higher or equal to 66.5º. In this case, the correct option is 62º. If you come across this question in your official examination, feedback would be highly appreciated!",

The deviation experienced is specific to each aircraft and varies with heading and magnetic latitude. The variation with heading occurs because sometimes the resultant aircraft fields will oppose the Earth's field and sometimes reinforce them. Which heading this occurs on, depends on how the deviating fields are aligned within the aircraft. The variation with magnetic latitude occurs because the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field varies in strength depending where it is detected. At the magnetic equator, all the field is in the horizontal component, at the poles the horizontal component is weak to non-existent. Where the horizontal component is weak, the deviating forces are proportionally stronger and therefore the amount of deviation is greater near the poles and correspondingly less at the magnetic equator.",

            "explanation": "The Earth is roughly spherical. Because of its spin it is slightly fatter at the equator and slightly flattened at the poles, a shape known as an oblate spheroid or an ellipsoid. You might come across the term \"Geoid\". In geodesy, a reference ellipsoid is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid. Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude and elevation are defined. Modern navigation systems, like GPS, ude these reference systems and the most common of these is the World Geodetic System of 1984 or WGS 84, created by the United States military. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic latitude is the angle that a line drawn perpendicular to the surface through a point on a spheroid makes with the equatorial plane (plumb-line on the ellipsoid) and is other than the geocentric (earth centred) latitude. Despite the fact that, in general navigation, we assume that one degree of latitude along a meridian equals to 60 nm. In fact, using a WGS84 ellipsoid, one degree of latitude has a length of 59.7 nm (110.574 km) at the equator and increases progressively with increasing latitude up to 60.3 nm (111.694 km) at the poles.",

We know that the Relative bearing at first position is 45˚ to the left. Therefore, the angle at the airplane's location at old position equals to 45˚. After three minutes, the Relative bearing is 90˚ to the left. Therefore, after three minutes, the angle in the triangle at airplane location equals to 90˚. The difference in bearings is 45˚. Therefore, the triangle angle at landmark location is also 45˚. As we have triangle with two equal angles of 45˚, it is an isosceles triangle.

(2) Place wind direction (190º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (30 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (060º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (130 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 147 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => 10ºR. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, True Heading = TT + 10ºR = 060º + 10ºR = 070º(T) Convert true heading into Magnetic: Use the mnemonic: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

It is known that \"1' change of latitude along a meridian or the Equator equals to 1 NM\". So, 416 NM along a meridian correspond to: 416' or 6° 56' change of latitude. Since the aircraft flies South, the latitude will decrease and the latitude at point B will be: 48°12’ N - 6° 56' = 41°16’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point B will be: 41°16’ N 004°52’ E. After point B, the aircraft continues East, i.e. 090° along a parallel of latitude, for 200 NM to point C. The distance along a parallel of latitude is given by the formula: Departure (NM) = Change of Longitude(') x Cosine of Latitude. Solving for Change of Longitude('), we get: Change of Longitude(') = Departure (NM) / Cosine of Latitude = 200 NM / Cos 41,27° = 266' or 4.43° or 4° 26'. Since the aircraft flies East, the longitude will increase and the longitude at point C will be: 004°52’E + 4° 26' = 009°18’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point C will be: 41°16’ N 009°18’ E.",

If you cut a sphere at one of its great circles, you'd cut it exactly in half. A great circle has the same circumference, or outer boundary, and the same centre point as its sphere. The geometry of spheres is useful for mapping the Earth and other planets. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but it maintains the general shape. All the meridians on Earth are parts great circles. Meridian and its anti meridian for a great circle. Meridians, including the prime meridian, are the north-south lines we use to help describe exactly where we are on the Earth. All these lines of longitude meet at the poles, cutting the Earth neatly in half. The Equator is another of the Earth's great circles. If you were to cut into the Earth right on its Equator, you'd have two equal halves: the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator is the only east-west line that is a great circle. All other parallels (lines of latitude) get smaller as you get near the poles. Great circles can be found on spheres as big as planets and as small as oranges. If you cut an orange exactly in half, the line you cut is the orange's great circle. And until you eat one or both halves, you have two equal hemispheres of the same orange. Great circles are also useful in planning routes. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere is always a segment of a great circle. Plotting great circles comes in very handy for airplane pilots trying to fly the shortest distance between two points.",

The aircraft departs at 12:15 and we know that at 12:27 (after 12 minutes), the aircraft has covered 40 NM. Ground speed = (40 ÷ 12) x 60 = 200 kt The off track error of 4 NM (1 NM + 3 NM) is recognized at 12:37. We need to calculate the distance along track and the TKE (Track Angle Error) at this position. Time from A to railroad track (40 NM) ⇒ 12:27 - 12:15 = 12 min Time from railroad track to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12:37 - 12:27 = 10 min Time from A to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12 min + 10 min = 22 min If the aircraft's ground speed is 200 kt, in 22 minutes, it will cover: (200 kt x 22 min) ÷ 60 = 73 NM Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 73 TKE = 3° (approx.) If we alter our heading by 3.3° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: Distance to go = 80 NM - 73 NM = 7 NM TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 7 TKE = 34° (approx.) So turning 3° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 34° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 3° + 34° = 37º (approx.) would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the right, therefore we must fly 37º to the left. Track = 235º - 37º = 198º The aircraft is 80 NM – 73 NM = 7 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 7 NM in 2 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:37 + 2 min = 12:39",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 280 kt. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºR drift and a track of 275º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 265º with 5ºR drift. All this means is that, to counteract an expected drift of 5ºR, the aircraft flew a heading of 265º(T). However, after covering a distance of 60 NM, our track error angle is 10º left, meaning our track made good has been 260º (T) Calculating the difference between our heading and the track made good results in 5º to the left (265ºT to 260ºT). The average drift observed from 10:20 UTC to 10:32 UTC amounts to 5º to the left. Note: Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading.

Thus, statement 5 is incorrect. 8.

            "explanation": "When a pilot realizes that he/she is behind schedule, most probably either a stronger headwind, or less tailwind or just headwind (in case calm wind was expected) is experienced. This situation will decrease the Groundspeed and as a consequence both the required total flight time and the total fuel consumption will increase. The fuel amount to cater for things that don't go to plan, such as stronger headwinds, re-routing, a flight level other than expected, is called \"Contingency fuel\". Also, any aircraft must be landed with at least the Final Reserve Fuel in its tanks. If it looks like that it will land with less than Final Reserve Fuel, EU OPS says that the pilot must declare an emergency. But, for this question the Contingency fuel may not be sufficient and so as to avoid any consumption of the Final Reserve Fuel while being still on the air before landing, the best action is to reduce, as much as possible, the remaining ground distance and flight time until the destination, by turning before the scheduled turning point and flying directly to the destination, provided that the ATC is informed of the pilot's intentions accordingly and no safety issues emerge. An emergency landing at the nearest suitable field may pose at risk both the passengers and the aircraft and would be recommended in case the remaining fuel was not sufficient to reach at any other suitable airfield. Flying to a lower altitude would decrease the TAS and the Groundspeed, thus the required flight time and fuel to destination would increase. Any orbit would further increase the flight time and total fuel consumption until destination. Further instructions from the ATC should be asked while continuing towards the destination without wasting flight time.",

The limited visibility at night might cause difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points to verify the position of the aircraft and cross-check the aircraft track, thus there is a danger of flying into terrain in the case of being lost. Therefore, the difficulty to identify the navigation features at night is the most significant hazard because it directly affects the pilot's ability to navigate safely and accurately during the flight. Tall obstacles at night are properly marked, and can be managed with proper planning, preparation, and adherence to procedures designed for night flying. Note: The difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points is caused due to limited visibility, so the choice 'Limited visibility and off-navigation challenges.' is a hazard but the most significant aspect of limited visibility is the inability to identify the landmarks. This is why the choice 'Difficulty in identifying landmarks and reference points.' is chosen the correct one.",

In cases where the pilot cannot verify their position, it is advised to initiate the \"unsure of position\" procedure. Should the pilot be unable to ascertain their position even after, they should proceed with the \"lost procedure.\" Nevertheless, if the pilot possesses knowledge of their location, they should proceed according to the original plan. In this case, given that the flight is scheduled to take place over a snowy region lacking ground landmarks, the pilot needs to exercise meticulous care in adhering to the predetermined headings. It's crucial to uphold situational awareness throughout the entire flight duration, consistently assess the flight's progress, and particularly when approaching a designated turning point devoid of visible ground references, make the turn toward the subsequent waypoint according to the pre-calculated time established during the planning phase. Unlike question 615066, this particular question does not indicate that the pilot is disoriented or lost. Consequently, there is no justification for initiating the \"lost procedure\".

When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. A tall rectangular building is a suitable ground feature for VFR navigation, because it is has the following characteristics: It has enough vertical extent to be identified from a considerable distance and altitude, and it has a distinctive shape that makes it easily recognizable. It is prominent and unique, standing out against the surrounding terrain. It makes contrast with its surroundings due to differences in shape and elevation.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANTE NOTE: There are 3 quite similar questions based on this premise. 618230, 615463 and this one. They are all asking for the best VFR features but have different options. We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. PICKING THE BEST VFR CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. With regards to this question, large water reservoir and tall masts are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique. Farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby. Telephone lines are very difficult to see from high up.",

One of the most common methods to navigate under VFR is by selecting, during the pre-flight planning procedure, the ground features, which are marked on the VFR chart and then seeking for them on the ground during the flight. The VFR charts depict topographic features and other information of interest to pilots flying visually, such as major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, airspace boundaries, etc. During VFR navigation, the cadets are usually instructed to hold the map oriented to the direction of flight, so that the surrounding topographic features can be easily identified, i.e. hold the map so that direction of flight is at the top (not North), also known as \"track-up\", so \"right\" on the map will correspond to \"right\" on the ground and map reading will be easier. Using the chart “track-up”, gives the best situational awareness to the crew and it can also be useful to check if the aircraft is on the planned position by checking if the ground features coincide with your expectations. Also, for convenience during flight, it is not necessary to hold the whole navigation chart, but it is preferred to hold only a a relevant with the trip part of the whole chart, so as not to reduce the pilot's field of view and handling effectiveness. \"North-up\" map orientation is mainly suggested for flight planning.",

CFIT occurs when an airworthy aircraft under the complete control of the pilot is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle. The pilots are generally unaware of the danger until it is too late. Many CFIT accidents occur because of loss of situational awareness and may happen not only in night or IMC conditions, but even in a VFR flight during the day. Accidents where the aircraft is out of control at the point of impact are not known as CFIT. Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT. Overcast sky and Snow-Covered Terrain - CORRECT: This is a situation where the snow-covered terrain and the overcast sky are mixed making the horizon invisible. The lack of the poor colour contrast, ground features and shadows increase the likelihood of loss of situational awareness by the pilot, creating illusions of climbing or descending while he/she actually flies level.",

            ],
            "explanation": "\"An 400 ft radio mast on the horizon.\" INCORRECT. Identifying features with significant vertical extent, such as masts and mountains, is crucial for safety during flight. However, they also serve as excellent visual checkpoints due to their visibility from a distance, especially in favorable weather conditions. These features become valuable references for navigation purposes. However, It's essential to recognize that the usefulness of features with substantial vertical extent may decrease as you fly at higher altitudes. When flying at 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL), a 400-foot-high mast might become difficult to spot due to its diminished visual prominence. \"A railroad perpendicular to the track.\" CORRECT. This is a conspicuous landmark with a great extent which can be easily located and identified from the altitude at which a VFR flight is normally operating. since this road is crossing perpendicularly the planned track, the crossing point could be used to check for any time deviation and to calculate the actual ground speed. \"A straight highway along the calculated track.\" INCORRECT. A landmark, even if easily identifiable, is not useful to check the aircraft's groundspeed as it wil not be crossing the path at any point. When flying, because of the great extent along the track, a second conspicuous landmark close to the crossing point is required. \"A large waterway in the direction of the aircraft’s nose.\" INCORRECT. While a large waterway can be a visual reference point and used as a checkpoint, it may not be as accurate or easy to measure ground speed as a perpendicular railroad track. Determining ground speed using a waterway may involve more challenges including, in this case, lack of perpendicular reference: Unlike a railroad track, which runs perpendicular to your flight path, a waterway may or may not be at a right angle to your track. Measuring the time it takes to fly over a distance along the waterway may not directly correspond to your ground speed due to the angle between your flight path and the waterway.",

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower?

As always, any feedback from the real exam is very useful, and please let us know which authority you sat with as well, thanks! The choice of ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. When flying in the winter, it is often necessary to rely on more prominent ground features. So, among others, you should also consider: The size and the uniqueness of the features. Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent, such as high radio masts or large, conspicuous buildings will be easier to identify. Time of year. Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. For example, after a recent snowfall, roads and railway lines may be totally obscured, woods and farmlands can blend in to surrounding fields, but big lakes and rivers might stand out more. Coastlines in particular will stand out firmly from the surroundings, as their appearance is not affected by snowfall. The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is low (for example a white building against snowy white terrain), then the range at which objects can be seen is reduced, and the ease of seeing them is reduced also. This particular landscape has pros and cons, as the buildings are mostly white, which do not stand out well against snow covered ground, however, it must be noted that this particular building is incredibly large, not fully white coloured, and certainly would be lit due to its size (it is over 500 ft tall). The image also includes lakes, rivers and is next to a coastline, which would be very easy to pick out in the snow. This is the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida, USA.",

Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT. One major factor of CFIT is the loss of situational awareness — failing to know at all times what the aircraft’s position is, how that position relates to the altitude of the surface immediately below and ahead, and how both relate to the course being flown. One of the contributory factors is weather: Rain, turbulence, clouds and icing, may increase the workload of the pilot and cause interference reducing the accuracy of radio navigation beacons.

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? With regards to this question, large water reservoir, tall masts and a high tension power line are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique. A fruit farm provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby.",

We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. This particular question states that \"large water features\" are not correct, and that aligns with recent feedback for this question, however, \"large water features\" are correct for question 615371, due to the different options. The wording might be different in the exam, which might make it clearer why this is the case. This question has also been seen as a \"choose 3\" question in the UK CAA. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice.

Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. EASA do like them as VFR features though, so bear that in mind.",

Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent, such as high radio masts, will be easier to identify. Time of year. Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. For example, after a recent snowfall, roads and railway lines may be totally obscured, woods and farmlands can blend in to surrounding fields, but big lakes and rivers might stand out more. The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is low (for example a white building against a snowy white mountain), then the range at which objects can be seen is reduced.

Visual navigation is the use of topographical maps to monitor or fix the aircraft's position.

Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, as in our case, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air.

As soon as the position of the aircraft is in doubt: Note the time Communicate, if in contact with an ATC unit to request assistance Consider using any ground navigational aids that may be available to give position information etc. For this question, the pilot should be advised by RODING VOR/DME along the whole trip, which is the only ground navigational aid in the vicinity of the route's turning points, so as to ensure that he follows his planned route and to correct promptly any inattention which may cause any inadvertent drift. If tuned on the RODING VOR/DME frequency, the pilot will figure out that instead of Radial 130o from RODING VOR/DME, which intersects the planned turning point VILSHOFEN airport, he/she finally is on Radial 110o from the same VOR/DME, which intersects the non-scheduled turning point ELSENTHAL-GRAFENAU airport.",

They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. The selected feature has a white colour. On a winter day, during a special VFR flight with low clouds, reduced visibility, and a snowy surface, the feature will have the same colour with the ground and the surrounding features. This means that it will not make any visual contrast with the surrounding terrain and the pilot will find it extremely difficult to recognize it.",

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air.

            "explanation": "NOTE: There is another question in the database that is similar to this question (615463) and asks for the best VFR features, but it has different options. We have seen many different feedback for these questions and we believe there are several versions used by EASA. So far the ‘rule’ for these questions is that ‘farmland’ is never correct and if high-tension power lines are present, they are correct (this is a debatable point, but sometimes a good VFR feature, particularly in forested areas). After that, it is common sense. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Power lines aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. And, a farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby.",

The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

As they are no longer on their flight planned route, following the OFP is not very useful, and the low cloud means they cannot climb higher whilst remaining VMC. When a pilot becomes in doubt about their position, they should perform some or all of the following actions: 1. Note the time. 2. Communicate, if in contact with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, to request assistance. 3. Consider using any radio-navigation aids that may be available to give position information. 4. If short of fuel or near controlled airspace and not in contact with ATC, set 121.5 MHz and make a PAN call. 5. If that is not necessary, check the directional indicator (DI) and compass are still synchronised and continue to fly straight and level and on the planned heading. 6. Estimate the distance travelled since the last known position. 7. Compare the ground with the aircraft's estimated position on the map. When the aircraft’s position is uncertain, ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Line features such as coastlines, railways, large highways, etc. can be easy to find and useful to then fly along until you can find your position on the map. 8. Once the position has been re-established, keep checking the heading and continue the flight by updating the estimated position regularly while looking for unique features such as hills, valleys, lakes, wood, built-up areas, rivers, coastlines, motorways and railways. In any case, maintain VMC and visual contact with the ground, note the fuel state and, if necessary, try to identify an area suitable for a precautionary landing.",

The same for high antennas which are identified on the VFR charts.

The choice of ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. So, among others, you should also consider the uniqueness and the contrast of the ground features. After examining the options given below the answer, we come to the following conclusions: The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is high (for example a valley against a hilly area), then the range at which objects can be seen is increased. A hill or a slightly steeper hillside within a hilly area does not provide uniqueness. Also, few small rivers that leave a big river may provide contrast, regarding the colours against the surrounding environment, but they are not unique. The big river at its own could be a preferable ground feature as a visual reporting point contrary to the few small rivers. Therefore, the best visual reporting point for an aircraft flying a VFR flight above a hilly area, seems to be a valley.",

In addition, some power lines may not be marked on charts, so pilots should always be on the lookout for any obstacles that may pose a risk to their flight.

Size and uniqueness: Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent will be easier to identify. Time of the year: Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. Planned Altitude: At lower levels, a selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Towers are the most suitable ground features for VFR navigation, if they are unique, since they are tall and prominent with enough vertical extent and can be easily identified from the air. A chart of 1: 500 000 scale is considered as a well enough detailed aeronautical chart, but not so much that small buildings, like individual houses or minor roads can be depicted.

Please keep sharing your feedback with each other and with us in the comments, it is always useful, especially with questions like this. We have added a table to the explanation to easily convey our current knowledge of which authorities are choosing which answer. Thanks again! Authority Reported answer Poland B UK A It seems that there might be two versions of this question, one asking why the pilot should keep his/her chart oriented to True North and the other why s/he should keep the chart oriented to True track. The correct option will differ whether it asks for True North or true track. It is advisable that the VFR chart should be lined up with the current track so that it depicts what you see outside. It is also easier to identify line features such as roads, rivers, and coastlines and track their progress along those features. This is particularly important for visual navigation, where the pilot relies on visual references to navigate, as it helps them to maintain situational awareness and stay on course. For instance, expected ground features left/right of the planned track on the chart can be spotted and identified easily on the ground. Orientation to the track direction helps the pilot to maintain situational awareness. The pilot can easily identify the location of the aircraft in relation to the surrounding terrain and navigation aids, which is essential for making safe and efficient navigation decisions. However, if the question asks the reason why the chart should be oriented to True North the correct is \"Aeronautical and topographical information can be easily read.\" If you need to read a frequency, for example, you should turn the chart to True North.",

These checkpoints are selected based on certain characteristics to ensure they are easily recognizable and can be reliably identified from the air. When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration.

Therefore, they are appropriate ground features during VFR navigation. 'A range of hills of uniform size, with NO additional features, is the best terrain to maintain good visual checkpoints.' ⇒ Incorrect A range of hills of uniform size, with no additional features will not make any contrast with the surrounding terrain and will not help the pilot identify them during VFR navigation.

Without adequate visual references, the pilot may have difficulty maintaining situational awareness and staying on course, increasing the risk of getting lost or deviating from the intended route. At night, you can see illuminated objects only, thus there is a danger of flying into terrain in the case of being lost. The other options mentioned are also important considerations for night VFR flights, but limited visibility of navigation features is the most significant hazard because it directly affects the pilot's ability to navigate safely and accurately during the flight. Tall obstacles at night are properly marked, and can be managed with proper planning, preparation, and adherence to procedures designed for night flying.",

            "explanation": "Navigation by Dead Reckoning is part of the basic training for pilots. Based in the calculation of the position of airplane based in the direction and the ground distance traveled from a determined point. With the introduction of modern navigational techniques such as GPS and conventional radio navigational aids, this may seem outdaated technique. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with. Reference to a GPS or other navigation aid. It is likely that a route from the departure aerodrome directly to the destination will be divided into a number of route segments with the creation of turning points and waypoints. Breaking the route down into route segments brings several advantages: 1. Route segment can be selected to pass near a prominent ground feature, to help the pilot fly on track. 2. Shorter route segments minimize off-track errors by reducing the time allowed for them to develop. 3. High terrain or significant obstructions like telecommunication masts can be avoided. Really important in poor visibility conditions. Choose compact ground features as turning points and waypoints to ensure that routes are flown with precision. Large build up areas make poor turning points because of their size.",

On a Lambert conformal projection chart the great circles are straight lines exactly at the parallel of origin. When being away from the parallel of origin, they are slightly curved concave to it. In reality, the distortion of the great circles is so small that can be assumed to be straight lines. The rhumb lines are always curves concave to the pole. Route CD runs in an East-West direction. Position C lies slightly above 60°N latitude, while position D lies significantly above 60°N latitude, resulting in an average latitude of around 70°. With a significant change in longitude, the conversion angle is also substantial. Consequently, the difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle connecting positions C and D is considerable. Route GH runs in an East-West direction. As indicated in the figure, position G and H show a significant change in longitude. However, both lie slightly above 20°N latitude. Due to this small lower latitude, the conversion angle is also small, resulting in a minimal difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route GH. Route AB also travels in a nearly North-South direction. With a mean latitude of approximately 30° and a smaller change in longitude, the conversion angle remains small. Consequently, the difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route AB is also minimal, compared to Route CD. Route EF also travels in a nearly North-South direction. According to the figure, positions E is slightly above 60°N and F just over 40°N. However, despite the high mean latitude, the change in longitude for route EF is considerably small. Consequently, the conversion angle for route EF is lower than that of route CD, leading to a smaller difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle.",

Let's consider the following scenario: the positions (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) are compared to the positions (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W). It is important to note that the former positions are located at a lower latitude than the latter ones. Additionally, the change of longitude is the same in both scenarios (a 20° change in longitude). Given that the change in longitude is the same for both pairs of positions, and considering the lower latitude of (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) compared to (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W), we can infer from the provided explanation that the difference in distance between the Great Circle track and the Rhumb Line track connecting (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) will be smaller than the difference in distance between the Great Circle track and the Rhumb Line track connecting (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W). In other words, the difference in distance between the Great Circle track and the Rhumb Line track connecting (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) will be less than 2.5 NM.",

The rhumb line value can be thought of as the \"average\" great circle track (GCT), and sits halfway between the initial GCT and final GCT. The difference between the rhumb line and the initial/final true track is called the convergence angle. The convergence angle is simply half of the convergency, so 3.2º. We are calculating to the nearest whole degree, so lets just use 3º. Then, using a simple drawing such as the one shown above, or knowledge of the D-I-I-D diagram, the initial true track can be calculated to be a value 3º higher than the rhumb line track, and the final true track is a number 3º lower than the rhumb line track, which is 295º (T).",

Similarly, the southern vertex is the most southerly point on the Great Circle. When the aircraft reaches the vertex the GCT will be equal to the RBT. Using trigonometry we will determine the RBT: Adjacent side, departure = 50º x 60 x cos (57,5º) = 1612 nm Opposite side, distance = 5º x 60 = 300 nm Applying the tangent you will come up with a 10º angle, flying northeast, 090º - 10º = 080º, the RBT. With reference to the D-I-I-D scheme we know that, flying in the westerly direction in the Northern Hemisphere, the value of the GCT will increase. Meaning that the final true track is greater than 080º. The angular value of the GCT will decrease until it reaches the vertex at 080º (GCT = RBT) and then it will increase. 091º > 080º, the aircraft has passed the vertex.
