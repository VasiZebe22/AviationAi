The pilot can control the stabiliser by using the trim wheel. If the linkage is mechanic or power-assisted, the neutral point of the control column changes with trim setting.

            "explanation": "To function as a lateral control, the spoilers rise on the wing with the up-going aileron (down-going wing), proportional to the aileron input. On the wing with the down-going aileron, they remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers cannot give an increase of lift, so a roll manoeuvre controlled by spoilers will give a net loss of lift. However, the spoiler has several advantages compared to the aileron: - There is no adverse yaw. - Wing twisting is reduced. - At transonic speed, its effectiveness is not reduced by shock wave induced flow separation. - They cannot develop flutter. - Spoilers do not occupy the trailing edge, which can be utilised for more flaps. An example is illustrated in the attached figure. Speed brakes have been selected, and then a turn to the left is initiated. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the up-going aileron will stay deployed, or modulate upwards, depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron will modulate towards the stowed position. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron may partially or fully stow, again depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. Note: Roll control spoilers are generally distributed throughout the wing, and the system depends on pilot input to modulate the degree of deflection and which spoilers to extend or retract. On this question, it seems that EASA considers the most likely to extend to be the outboard spoilers. If you see this question in your exam, we strongly recommend you appeal and report back to us any changes made to this question.",

Creating an unstable situation. Therefore, the effect is destabilizing. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

Pitch manoeuvrability is measured by the \"stick force per G\" (stick force stability), meaning how much force the pilot needs to apply to the controls to gain an extra 1G of vertical acceleration. The higher the stick force stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, so in this question, as the CG has been moved aft by the cargo, the manoeuvrability will be increased, so the stick force stability will decrease.

Most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. The trim is often done (and in this question certainly done) by an all moving tailplane, known as a variable-incidence horizontal stabiliser, so the whole stabiliser moves to perform the act of trimming. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra cargo behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards. This will be the same during the cruise, where less nose down moment will be required, so the leading edge of the stabiliser will be pointing more upwards than if the cargo was not loaded.",

Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance. To counter adverse yaw, some aircraft incorporate aileron/rudder coupling which is a system that automatically applies a rudder input in a turn to counter the adverse yawing moments generated by the ailerons. In a right turn, the left wing lift is increased by lowering the aileron. As we have described above, increased lift, increases induced drag, which generates a yawing moment in the opposite direction. As a result, the aircraft will be in an unbalanced turn. To re-balance the turn, right rudder must be applied.",

Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance. Adverse (aileron) yaw is corrected in the design by the use of either differential ailerons or Frise ailerons. The differential aileron deflection system ensures that the drag generated by both ailerons when rolling into or out of a turn is equal, thus eliminating adverse yaw. This is achieved by constructing the aileron system such that the angular deflection of the upgoing aileron is always proportionately greater than the deflection of the down going aileron.",

If you encounter this question during your official exam, kindly inform us. We appreciate your assistance. 081.05.07.01.01: Explain which parameters may be controlled in level flight with the pitch control law. Fly-by-wire is a sophisticated system that substitutes the traditional manual-mechanical flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. Within this system, a computer interface is interposed between the pilots and the final control surfaces. Modern commercial fly-by-wire aircraft integrate a flight-envelope protection system into their flight control software, which is housed within the flight control computer. This protection system serves the crucial role of preventing pilots from issuing control commands that could push the aircraft beyond its structural and aerodynamic operational boundaries. In the realm of fly-by-wire technology, the concept of flight envelope and maneuvering envelope protections is employed. These are governed by predefined control laws that serve as a set of rules, guiding the computers in transforming input signals. One of the most commonly used control laws involves managing the load factor in pitch control. Essentially, this means that the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) adjusts its position to maintain a specific load factor. When the pilot manipulates the sidestick, the THS moves accordingly, altering the load factor proportionally to the sidestick's deflection (refer to the attached diagram). This means that as long as the sidestick remains untouched, the aircraft will maintain its flight-path-angle-corrected load factor. For example, if the aircraft is in straight and level flight and the pilot pulls the sidestick, the aircraft will follow a curved trajectory, increasing its pitch angle until the sidestick is released.",

            "explanation": "Note: We did not receive much of the question text in the original feedback for this question but have been able to deduce the context of the question from the options. It may therefore be written quite differently in the exam, and we cannot ensure that it is even precisely the same question, so do read it careful and evaluate that yourself, and please place any further feedback in the comments, thank you! Adverse yaw is a yawing motion with an opposite direction to the turning/rolling motion of the aircraft. Adverse yaw is caused by the drag on the down-going aileron being greater than that on the up-going aileron. This is because the down-going aileron is effectively acting like a trailing edge flap with high camber, so higher drag, but the up-going aileron is reducing the camber of the wing, so has a lower drag. This imbalance in drag causes the yawing motion around the normal/vertical axis. Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance and may cause uncoordinated turns. Adverse (aileron) yaw is corrected in the design by the use of either differential ailerons, Frise ailerons or aileron/rudder coupling. The differential aileron system counteracts adverse yaw by making the draggy down-going aileron go proporitonally less far, so a smaller angular change, than the low drag up-going aileron. This means that the up-going aileron does more of the work, and therefore produces a similar amount of drag to the other aileron, and the aircraft roll rate is the same. This could mean, for instance, that the up-going aileron moves 30% further upwards than the down-going aileron goes downwards. For this question, BE VERY CAREFUL. The higher drag down-going aileron is on the UP-GOING WING. This means that; The up-going wing produces a greater amount of drag when normal ailerons are fitted. The differential ailerons will therefore make the aileron on that wing move less far to counteract the adverse yaw effect.",

If you see this question in the exam, please send anything you can remember to us in the comments, through the question feedback tab on your dashboard or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. In any conventional aircraft, the application of rudder will cause some secondary effect of roll, usually towards the direction that the rudder was applied. This effect is very strong in swept wing aircraft, and very noticeable when flying them, hence the reason most jets of this kind are flown without the use of the rudder pedals except for engine failures and crosswind take-offs and landings. Using full rudder deflection only to intercept the final approach course is a terrible idea as the aircraft will violently roll to the right. This is because the left wing will be significantly accelerated through a much longer arc that the right wing, which conversely gets a much reduced speed of airflow during that motion, causing a large right wing drop, and the right wing could even stall if the effect were large enough to increase the right wing's angle of attack above the critical AoA. As for the other answers: The left wing would not stall as there is greater airspeed over it and with no significant increase of angle of attack. Adverse yaw is a secondary effect which occurs when ailerons are used for roll purposes, so does not really apply to this situation. There is indeed a potential for loss of control to occur in this scenario, but we think this answer is way too vague (and the feedback was also not 100% about the wording here so we can't confirm it yet) so for now we are saying this is less correct than the potential for the right wing stalling.",

The horizontal straight line joining the most forward point of the fuselage of the airplane, the center of the nose, to the center of the most rearward point of the airplane’s fuselage is the longitudinal axis. It is often referred to as the roll axis because the airplane, in response to a control input by the pilot or as the result of an external disturbance, drops one wing and raises the other. Thus, it rotates or rolls about the longitudinal axis. The flight controls enable the pilot to rotate the airplane about its three axes.

When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Aeroplane 2: the thrust line is below the CG (the case of most airliners with underwing engines), therefore a thrust increase will produce an added pitch-up moment. This will cause the airplane to slow down more than necessary (despite the added thrust). Creating an unstable situation. To counteract this, a pitch-down moment must be created. Therefore, the elevator must be deflected downwards. Regardless of the type of aircraft, adjusting the configuration will always result in a trim change.

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra fuel behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards.",

Therefore, we will explain to you the basics here, then you can let us know if you see it in the exam, and what the correct answer was (or if the question/options were different at all), thank you! This comes back to stability, and longitudinal stability in particular (stability in pitch). Think of a stable aircraft like a throwing dart, weight at the front, fins at the back, and it is incredibly stable flying through the air, always landing facing into the dartboard. This is the same for an aircraft, and we have to make our \"weight\" (Centre of Gravity, CG) in front of our \"wings\", which are dictated by the Centre of Pressure (CP)/Centre of lift (CL) of our wings and other aerodynamic features. The \"neutral point\" is the average location of the pressure effects from all our wings, fuselage, engine cowlings and other aerodynamic features, sort of the balanced centre of pressure of the whole aircraft. As long as our CG is in front of our neutral point, then the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. Also, the weight, acting through the CG, is not in line with all the lift, acting through the CP. This means that the further forward weight will cause a nose-down moment. We obviously have to counteract this moment, and this is why the tailplane is tasked with providing a downwards force on the aircraft tail, causing a balancing nose-up moment. Of course, the movement of the CG and CP can change how much downforce the tail needs to produce. If the CG moves further forwards, the tailplane has to produce higher downforce to counteract the larger nose down moment, and vice-versa. The way that the tailplane produces downforce is two-fold. It usually has a low/negative angle of incidence, to provide a negative angle of attack, and the downwash from the wings causes an even larger negative angle of attack, particularly at high aircraft AoA (low speed), when the wing downwash angle is greater. This is why tailplanes have elevators, to change their angle of attack for control, and for trimming at different speeds. This does not unfortunately help us get a solid answer for this question. Of course, the increased speed means a higher airflow over the tailplane, but also leads to decreased downwash angle from the main wing (due to lower angle of attack), but now with a more negative angle of attack without accounting for downwash due to the lower pitch angle of the aeroplane. These are opposing effects, and without knowing the aircraft and speed range, it is really very difficult to say whether the force increases or decreases. Our tendency is to say that the downwash angle and pitch angle mostly cancel each other out, and that the increased airflow increases the down-force of the tailplane. We can also justify this by saying that when an aircraft gets faster, we have to trim down, which is us artificially decreasing the downforce of our tailplane via the elevator, this means the downforce must have been too large after the speed increase, therefore the force increased. We do not like having to use this as an justification, as there are other forces at play, but it works quite well for everyone to understand.",

            "explanation": "There are two scenarios that this could be; a faulty autopilot or trim runaway. A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is impossible to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. Therefore, first, the pilot must disconnect the autopilot to stop any autopilot fault from making the situation worse. They should then attempt to control the aircraft manually, and if the trim runaway continues, switch off the electric trim and trim manually. On balance, we would say that both of the actions in the question are correct, and with pretty much correct reasoning, although there will be an order in which to do these actions, set out by the manufacturer. We haven't had this answer confirmed though, so please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and anything you can remember about it, thank you!",

If the CG is too far aft, the aircraft may be excessively tail-heavy, leading to difficulty in controlling the pitch attitude. When an aircraft has an aft center of gravity (CG), it will tend to rotate rapidly during takeoff and naturally adopt a high nose attitude during climb-out. Conversely, if the CG is forward (nose-heavy), the opposite effect will occur. To counterbalance these tendencies and ensure a smooth takeoff, the position of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) is adjusted. This adjustment aims to achieve two goals: first, to maintain a standard rotation rate, and second, to facilitate the aircraft settling into the desired climb-out attitude with minimal trim adjustments.",

In this setup, the flying control is connected to a small servo tab mounted on the trailing edge of the main control surface, rather than directly to the control surface itself. Moving the servo tab generates a force that moves the main control surface. In summary, the control surface is only moved by aerodynamic forces while the servo tab is moved directly by the pilot. Regarding this question: Imagine the aircraft is parked with no wind and the flight controls are not locked. The control surface would tilt down due to gravity. If the pilot moves the controls, only the servo tab moves; the control surface stays tilted down. When taxiing with a headwind, the control surface can level out due to aerodynamic forces. The pilot can then adjust the angle using the servo tab, though less effectively than in flight. If taxiing with a tailwind stronger than the aircraft's speed, the relative wind from behind can push the control surface up or down, depending on its previous position. Thus, the statement that \"the position is undetermined during taxiing, in particular with tailwind\" is correct.",

Consequently, the slope of the total lift vector generates a rearward component on the upgoing wing and a forward component on the down going wing. These are yaw moments but in the opposite direction to that of the roll caused by the difference of the induced drag of each wing. This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: rudder/aileron coupling. slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. differential aileron deflection. The differential aileron deflection system ensures that the drag generated by both ailerons when rolling into or out of a turn is equal, thus eliminating adverse yaw. This is achieved by constructing the aileron system such that the angular deflection of the upgoing aileron is always proportionately greater than the deflection of the down going aileron.",

The trimmable stabilizer's primary advantage is that it provides tremendous trimming power over the full speed range of the airplane since the entire stabiliser may be moved to trim the aircraft. Summary: A trimmable horizontal stabiliser is more suitable to cope with the large trim changes generated by the high lift devices on most jet transport aeroplanes. \"II. A trim tab runaway causes less control difficulty.\" CORRECT Runaway trim occurs when the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) or other trim devices on the aircraft tail fails to stop at the desired position and continues to deflect up or down. A trim tab is much smaller than a trimmable horizontal stabiliser. Therefore, if it runs to the wrong position, it will produce smaller forces than a THS, thus causing less control difficuty.",

            "explanation": "Ailerons are the control surface on an aircraft that controls roll. They are usually mounted at the tips of the wings, to create the largest moment arm between them and the centre of gravity, for greater effectiveness. This can become problematic, particularly at high speeds. At high speeds, the forces on a control surface are so great that they can actually twist the wing they are connected to. The further outboard the ailerons are, the easier it is to cause the wing to twist, as it has less stiffness. Imagine a down-going aileron, used to increase the lift of the wing and make the wing rise. This would also twist the wing so its trailing edge was up, and therefore the leading edge goes down, causing the wing to lose lift, and the wing would drop, instead of rising. We call this aileron reversal, shown in the annex above. This is why many high speed aircraft often have secondary ailerons, which are called inboard ailerons, much closer to the fuselage, that are used during high speed flight, and the outboard ailerons are locked in place to avoid control reversal, flutter, and other structural issues due to the high aerodynamic forces. Some aircraft use roll spoilers also. There is also a low speed aileron reversal that happens near the stall, so be aware of the similar names.",

This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. The deflection of the ailerons on airplanes fitted with rudder coupling causes the rudder to move an amount proportional to the angular displacement of the aileron and to oppose adverse yaw.",

            "explanation": "An aeroplane is trimmed when it will maintain its attitude and speed without the pilot having to apply any load to the cockpit controls. If it is necessary for a control surface to be deflected to maintain balance of the aircraft, the pilot will need to apply a force to the cockpit control to hold the surface in its deflected position. This force may be reduced to zero by operation of the trim controls. The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. VARIABLE INCIDENCE TAILPLANE The Variable Incidence Horizontal Stabiliser provides pitch trim on most transport category aircraft. Varying the angle of incidence has the same effect as moving the elevator, but is aerodynamically more efficient, particularly at high airspeeds, and can provide a considerable trim range. An actuator near the leading edge varies the angle of incidence of the stabiliser. This normally operates in conjunction with the elevator to produce the least trim drag. The position of the CG directly affects the amount of trim necessary for the angle of attack required. A forward CG adds to the inherent longitudinal stability of the aeroplane; the pilot may run out of elevator up movement and be unable to maintain the required attitude. An aft CG decreases the longitudinal stability and makes the aeroplane more difficult or impossible to control in pitch. The CG must remain within the CG safe envelope at all times to ensure that the aeroplane remains controllable in all phases of flight. The elevator trim or stabiliser trim setting must be preset to a value for take-off and initial climb that will ensure a minimum stick force during this critical stage of flight. In comparison with a correctly balanced aeroplane during take-off, the position of the stabiliser for a nose-light aeroplane requires nose-down trim from an increased stabiliser angle of incidence.",

Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer would could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional computers and hydraulic systems.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. In this case, if an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection",

They also need large control surfaces to be able to control such large aircraft. For these reasons, elevators are often not enough on their own to provide all the pitch trim and pitch control required. Some aircraft use a variable incidence horizontal stabiliser and elevators, which just means that the whole tailplane moves in order to trim the aircraft and the elevators are a control surface on the back of this. Some aircraft go even further than this, and have something known as an \"all moving tailplane\", or \"all-flying tailplane\", and is also known as a \"slab tail\". This has no elevator surface at the back, and combines the trim and control inputs into a single movement that the whole tail makes. This is more efficient than using elevators only, as it is a large (full wing) surface making a small change, rather than smaller elevators making a large change, and this not only causes a lot less aerodynamic drag, but also requires less force from the aircraft's hydraulic systems. The reason less force is required to move the all-flying tailplane than elevators is because elevators are hinged at the front, whereas \"slab tails\" rotate around a point closer to the middle, and therefore the front of the tail helps the movement somewhat. Also, a much smaller movement is required, which does not \"fight\" the airflow as much, like an elevator does. This is why they may also be used on light aircraft to provide \"lighter\" stick forces, but on larger aircraft, the hydraulics are doing all the hard work anyway.",

However, they are not suitable for jet airplanes because of their large range of operating speeds, preference, for this type of airplane, is given to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer. There are two types of trim tab in common use: the variable and the fixed. The variable trim tabs may be manually or electrically controlled. If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up. This does not affect the static longitudinal stability. The moment required to move the primary control surface to the required position (MM) is equal to the force (FM) multiplied by the length of the arm (Am) from the hinge of the elevator to the center of pressure of the elevator main control surface. The same moment can be applied to the elevators by a smaller force (FT) in the opposite direction generated by a trim tab multiplied by the longer arm distance (AT) from the center of pressure of the trim tab to the elevator hinge-line. In other words, (FM × AM) = (FT × AT). The trim tab thereby does the work required to maintain the elevator out of the neutral position and there is no need for any force from the pilot’s controls.",

The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment. INBOARD AILERONS Ailerons are normally situated at the wing tips to give the greatest rolling moment for the force produced. However, this means they are also able to generate the maximum twisting loads on the wing. For instance, a down-going aileron will twist the wing tip and decrease wing tip incidence. The wing is not a rigid structure and any twist will cause a decrease of aileron effectiveness. As IAS increases, a down-going aileron will give more wing twist (decreased wing tip incidence). Eventually, an IAS will be reached at which the decrease in tip incidence will give a larger downforce than the upforce produced by the aileron. This is called high speed “aileron reversal”; the wing will go down, rather than up as the pilot intended. To reduce this effect, the ailerons could be mounted further inboard. Unfortunately, this would reduce aileron effectiveness at low speed. Alternatively, two sets of ailerons may be fitted: one set at the wing tips for use only at low speeds when the forces involved are low, and one set inboard for use at high speeds when the forces are greater and could cause greater structural distortion. Outboard (low speed) ailerons are “locked-out” as the flaps retract. At low speed both sets of ailerons work, but at high speed only the inboard ailerons respond to control input.",

In this case, the pilot is trimmed for a low speed (forget flap settings for now because they make things overly complicated but don't change the answer), which means being trimmed for a high angle of attack. In reality, the basis behind trimming is actually quite complicated, but in essence, we trim to balance the aircraft at a particular angle of attack, which equates to a speed (there are a lot of assumptions in that statement but it's fine for this question). When we accelerate from that speed, the aircraft will provide too much lift and pitch up naturally, this is where we would usually begin to trim down to decrease the angle of attack, but without a working trimmer, we have to hold it on the elevator control whilst out of the trimmed condition. Without an elevator, the aircraft will continue to pitch up until it stops accelerating. If there isn't a separate elevator, then the aircraft will have to be trimmed with speed using thrust, faster makes it pitch up, slower makes it pitch down. The aircraft will attempt to hold the same angle of attack, which loosely equates to a speed. It can be flown like this, but it would not be easy. This question seems like there is a separate trimmer to the elevator, so that should not be necessary.",

To relieve the pilot of the need to apply so much force to operate the controls servo-tabs are fitted to carry out this function. The servo-tab is a small tab hinged on the trailing edge of the primary control surface and linked directly to the control column. There is no direct link between the control column and the primary control surface. The function and operation of the servo-tab is the same as the balance tab and moves the trim tab in the opposite direction to the movement of the primary control surface. However, at low IAS the servo-tab makes the main control surface less effective. The position of a servo-controlled primary control surface cannot be determined until a positive pressure is applied to the servo-tab by the airflow. In flight, if a servo-controlled elevator jams the servo-tab reverses the direction of the pitch control input, because the elevator becomes part of the fixed horizontal stabilizer and the servo-tab now acts as a small elevator because despite its small size it has a longer moment arm than the elevator and consequently generates a large moment. Under normal circumstances an up servo-tab position would drive the elevator to a downward deflection causing the airplane’s nose to go down, but if the elevator is fixed the servo-tab in an up position will cause the airplane’s nose to move up.",

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and in the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is exactly what the question is referring to. Extra weight at the front of the aircraft will make the aircraft nose heavy, requiring nose-up stabiliser trim to feel the same. A nose up stabiliser trim is caused by providing extra downforce (or less lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a lower angle, with its leading edge pointing more downwards.",

These axes are at right angles to each other and all pass through the aircraft’s centre of gravity. The moment around an axis is produced by changing the aerodynamic force on the appropriate aerofoil. The magnitude of the force is a product of the dynamic pressure (IAS) and the angular displacement of the control surface. Aerodynamic force can be changed by: - adjusting the camber of the aerofoil. - changing the incidence of the aerofoil. - decreasing lift and increasing drag by “spoiling” the airflow. Changing the camber of any aerofoil (wing, tailplane or fin) will change its lift. Deflecting a control surface effectively changes its camber. AILERONS The primary effect of ailerons is to provide roll control about the longitudinal axis A downward movement of the aileron causes an increase in the effective angle of attack and a corresponding increase in lift, whilst an upward movement of the aileron causes a reduction in the effective angle of attack and a decrease in lift. The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment.",

This is known as the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or via email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can correct any differences and verify the answer, thank you! There are two scenarios that this could be. Faulty autopilot or trim runaway. A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is difficult to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. We would say that as the aircraft is already struggling to maintain altitude, disconnecting the autopilot is the best bet, and the pilots can switch off the electric trim and use the manual one if the problem has not been fixed.",

Pitot pressure is fed to one side of a chamber and static pressure to the other, which moves a diaphragm under the influence of changing dynamic pressure with airspeed. This causes “regulated” hydraulic pressure to provide a resistance or ‘feel’ on the pilot’s input controls proportional to IAS2, just as in a manual control. In addition, stick force should increase as stick displacement increases. An advantage of artificial feel is that it can be configured to provide envelope protection, which prevents the pilot over stressing the aircraft. The Boeing777 fly- by-wire system employs envelope protection. This feature of the artificial-feel system provides increasingly greater force when the aircraft is pushed to its limits.",

The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. A Trimmable Horizontal Stabiliser (THS) enables a larger CG and speed range than a conventional tailplane with stabiliser, elevator and trim tab, because the whole stabiliser may be moved for trimming the aeroplane, instead of a relatively “small” elevator and trim tab only (a larger surface is much more effective). This also leads to more control difficulty due to a jammed stabiliser. If an aircraft if configured and trimmed for take-off with a jammed stabiliser, the aircraft will remain trimmed as long as there are no major changes in speed, power/thrust, CG position or configuration.",

Remember that the trim tab is deflected in the opposite direction than the elevator. For a trimmable horizontal stabiliser, the whole stabiliser's incidence angle can be changes as trimming. The pilot can control the stabiliser by using the trim wheel. If the linkage is mechanic or power-assisted, the neutral point of the control column changes with trim setting.

The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The limits of the hard protection prevent the pilot from exceeding the designed flight envelope of the aircraft. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

The top of the lever is connected to the control column and the balance tab is connected to the same lever just above the pivot. Thus, movement of the control column is transmitted to the primary control surface but does not directly operate it. To ensure that the balance tab is only effective when it is required, the operating lever of the balance tab system is pivoted through a spring mounted on the elevator main control surface. This is the ‘spring tab.’ When the elevators are operated with at low airspeeds, the control column movement is fed directly to the primary control surface with no deflection of the balance tab so that there is no geometric movement between them. However, at higher speeds, one side of the spring is compressed and changes the geometric position of the balance tab relative to the main elevator control surface. The spring causes the tab to move in the opposite direction to the main control surface at an ever-increasing angle, which is directly proportional to the increasing airspeed. Thus, the spring tab assists the pilot by reducing the stick force required to operate the main control surface to a similar level for all airspeeds. At high IAS, the spring tab behaves like a servo-tab.",

Consequently, there is little control column load and there is a lack of feel to the controls. This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe.

These operate in the opposite sense to the balance tab by deflecting the anti-balance tab in the same direction as that of the primary control surface and increase the aerodynamic loading.

The forces and effectiveness of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) are greatly affected by the effective angle of attack of the oncoming airflow. This is not just the relative airflow around the whole aircraft as this air has been somewhat affected by the main wing ahead. The effective airflow aver the tailplane is mostly determined by the downwash from the wing. The main wing works by deflecting a large mass of air slightly downwards as it leaves the wing, so as the aircraft speeds up, there is greater airflow over the wing and that greater amount of air needs slightly less downwards deflection. As long as the right momentum change occurs, the aircraft will have the same amount of lift to counteract drag. This means that the angle of attack of the main wing is reduced, the coefficient of lift is reduced, etc., but most importantly for this question, the downwash angle is decreased. The tailplane often operates with a completely negative angle of attack, partly from the design and partly from this downwash from the main wing, in order to produce downforce to balance out the aircraft force couples and keep the aircraft nose up. This decrease in downwash means that the airflow arriving at the tailplane is \"flatter\" than before, i.e. it has less negative angle of attack.",

The final degradation is Mechanical back-up. The aircraft is flown in pitch through use of the pitch trim wheel and roll by a mechanical connection retained to the rudder pedals (through the secondary effect of yaw). It is designed to allow the pilots to maintain control of the aircraft, while restoring flight control computers, after a complete power interruption. In the event of computer failure on a FBW aircraft, some form of back-up mode is required in the event of total computer failure.

Therefore, only small deflections are necessary when flying with high airspeeds and larger deflections at lower speeds. The lift equation states: LIFT = ½ρV2SCL CL = coefficient of lift. This represents angle of attack of the airfoil and the shape of the airfoil. This described in terms of thickness/chord ratio and a camber and can be altered in flight, for example, by lowering the flaps. ρ = The density of the air. For any given altitude during subsonic flight, the density may be considered to be constant. V2 = The velocity of the aircraft, squared. S = The wing area. The lift formula can also be rearranged and written as: LIFT = q × S × CL (q = dynamic pressure, i.e. ½ρ × V2). In the lift equation all factors except density and speed (TAS) are constant. At higher altitude ρ is reduced; therefore TAS (V) must be increased to maintain the same lift (= weight). Drag equation states that: DRAG = ½ρV2SCD ρ = the mass density of the fluid (rho), V = the velocity of the object relative to the air, S = the reference area, CD = the drag coefficient - a dimensionless constant. The drag formula can be rearranged and written as: DRAG = CD × ½ρ × V2 × S From the drag equation it is clear that drag is directly proportional to the frontal area: if it increases by a factor of e.g. 3 the drag will be increased by the same factor.",

While the question does not explicitly specify, it is presumed to pertain to asymmetric flight. In this scenario, the live engine generates a yawing moment on the dead engine, necessitating corrective action. The pivotal response involves applying rudder input to counteract the yaw induced by the engine failure. However, employing the rudder creates a sideslip, leading to increased drag. The offset rudder also generates a lateral force, exacerbating the sideslip. To mitigate these effects, banking (ailerons) towards the live engine is recommended. This banking maneuver reduces the required deflection of the rudder to maintain the desired track and minimize drag. It's crucial to note that a maximum banking angle of 5° towards the live engine is specified. This limitation is imposed to prevent larger bank angles, which could significantly diminish the vertical lift component.",

The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. To counteract adverse yaw the Frise ailerons are designed so that their leading edge produces sufficient profile drag on the upgoing aileron to equal the induced drag of the down going aileron and thus eliminate adverse yaw.",

Creating an unstable situation. To counteract this, a pitch-down moment must be created. Therefore, the elevator must be deflected downwards. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

All aircraft have limitations to their speed and the loads that they can sustain at those speeds. In particular, we have to know about the load/speed diagram for CS-25 (large) aeroplanes. There is a diagram for the maximum load factors (positive and negative) that an aircraft can sustain, whether that limit was to do with a stall limit, or a structural load factor limit. There is also a limiting gust envelope diagram for the maximum gusts an aircraft must be able to handle at various speeds, see annex above. This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. There is also a flight demonstrated design dive speed (VDF) which is a demonstrated speed that the aircraft can handle without associated vibrations, buffet or flutter. It is different from VD but for the purposes of this question we do not need to know any more about it. To keep the aircraft within safe operation, the VMO (maximum operating speed) must be kept below VC. This is still very fast, and should not be exceeded in normal operations. This means that it is always sufficiently less than from VD/MD and VDF/MDF. CS 25.1505 Maximum operating limit speed The maximum operating limit speed (VMO/MMO, airspeed or Mach number, whichever is critical at a particular altitude) is a speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or descent), unless a higher speed is authorised for flight test or pilot training operations. VMO/MMO must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising speed VC and so that it is sufficiently below VD/MD or VDF/MDF, to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations. The speed margin between VMO/MMO and VD/MD or VDF/MDF may not be less than that determined under CS 25.335(b) or found necessary during the flight tests conducted under CS 25.253.",

            "explanation": "This question is ambiguous and the answer depends on the interpretation of the question text. There are two possible scenarios: If the question is referring to different aircraft classes (CS 25 vs CS 23), then a light aircraft (CS 23) has a maximum limiting load factor of 3.8 g, whereas a heavy aircraft (CS 25) has a maximum limiting load factor of 2.5 g. In this case, the heavy aircraft will reach its limiting load at a lower value than that of a lighter aircraft. If the question is referring to the same aircraft with a change in mass (for instance, due to fuel consumption), then the limiting load factor is attained at the same value regardless of mass. This is most likely what the question is referring to. Let's consider the following scenario: A Boeing 737 (CS 25) takes off with a mass of 200 tonnes and is limited to a maximum load factor of 2.5 g, which would create a certain amount of stress on the wings if applied. After several hours and using most of its fuel, the aircraft's mass is reduced to 100 tonnes. Applying 2.5 g at this lower mass would create a lower amount of stress on the wings. In theory, the lighter aircraft could withstand more \"g\" before the stress reached the same level as during takeoff. However, in practice, a CS25 aircraft is certified to a maximum load factor of 2.5 g regardless of its mass. Therefore, the limiting load factor is still 2.5 g, regardless of the aircraft's current mass. For the CS-25 category, the maximum positive and minimum negative limitation of load factor is: nMAX = 2.5; nMIN = -1 in clean configuration (high lift devices not extended) The CS-23 category includes three subparts: Normal [N] nMAX = 3.8 nMIN = -1.52 Utility [U] nMAX = 4.4 nMIN = -1.76 Aerobatic [A] nMAX ≥ 6 nMIN ≤ 3",

            ],
            "explanation": "A gust is a localized sudden and rapid change to the speed of the air in the atmosphere that can be either horizontal or vertical. The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. Vertical gusts will affect the load factor (n) by changing the angle of attack of the wing. For a given gust speed and aircraft TAS, the increment in the load factor depends on the increase in CL per change in angle of attack due to the gust (the slope of the lift curve). If the lift curve has a steep slope, the ‘g’ increment will be greater. Factors which affect the lift curve are aspect ratio and wing sweep. Wings having a low aspect ratio, or sweep, will have a lower lift curve slope, and so will give a smaller increase in ‘g’ when meeting a given gust at a given TAS. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft.

The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft. For a given TAS and gust speed, the increase of lift will be proportional to the wing area. Therefore, the increase in load factor is inversely proportional to the wing loading. Wing Loading = Weight/(Wing Area) Decreasing mass, decreases wing loading which increases load factor. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. With increasing altitude, density decreases and any aerodynamic force resulting from a gust will be smaller. Thus, when comparing two aircraft flying at different altitudes, the one flying in thicker air (lower altitude) will experience an increased increment in load factor following a gust. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

Gust-Load Diagram To avoid stalling and exceeding the limiting load factor an airplane must be operated within the limitations imposed by the gust envelope, which is graphically constructed by using the arbitrary values of gust speed against the EAS of the airplane originating from a load factor value of +1.0 and specified in CS 25.341(a)(5)(I), as In plain words, separate from the load factor envelope of the aircraft is the limiting gust envelope (gust-load diagram), which starts at 1G instead of 0G as we fly around straight and level at 1G, and dictates the speeds VB, VC and VD. The speeds are as follows: VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of at least 66 fps (feet per second). VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. Obviously you can see that the gust envelope starts at 1G and 0 kt, but at zero knots where the aircraft is stalled of course, so the envelope actually starts at the stall speed curve, between where the gust lines intersect the curve. Yes, this question is very poorly worded but we can see what the examiner means and it is based off early feedback yet so more is required, hopefully it will be slightly better worded in the exam.",

We have recently changed the answer to this due to feedback. We find this question very odd, because \"0.9 x VD\" can be a range of values (as VD can be a range of values), and there are other factors to the calculation of VNE that you can see in the CS23 specifications below (CS25 aircraft do not have a VNE). Also, we think the examiner is very misleading to include \"VD\" as an option, as it is certainly correct (VNE is always less than VD), but is less specific than \"0.9 x VD\", making it tough to decide between \"less specific but absolutely correct\" and \"more specific but more complex to justify\" answers. Please keep on sending any exam feedback you have, and we will keep these questions as up to date as we can for you, thanks! Each type of aircraft has its own specific flight envelope, within which it can be safely operated in accordance with the EASA Certification Specifications. This is represented on a velocity against load factor, or V-n diagram. The high-speed limit for many (but not all) CS-23 aircraft is the never exceed speed (VNE) and is a design reference point for the aircraft beyond which the aircraft must not be flown. It provides a safety margin with the point at which structural damage or failure may occur(VD). VNE is the red radial line at the high speed end of the airspeed indicator. Never Exceed Speed VNE: VNE is set below VD to allow for speed upsets to be recovered before reaching any point of possible damage. VNE equals 0.9 x VD in most cases, but please see the regulation for this below, as there is some \"wiggle room\" in the regulation that makes things slightly more complex (hence our unhappiness with these options). CS 23.1505 - Airspeed Limitations (a) The never-exceed speed VNE must be established so that it is – (1) Not less than 0.9 times the minimum value of VD allowed under CS 23.335; and (2) Not more than the lesser of – (i) 0.9 VD established under CS 23.335; or (ii) 0.9 times the maximum speed shown under CS 23.251.",

The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. It can be defined by: load factor(n) = (Lift(L)) / (Weight(W)) In straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, thus n = 1. In this exercise, the increment in CL from a gust will be of 0.1 for every degree of angle of attack impacted by the gust. We also know that the aircraft encounters a gust which increases its angle of attack by 3°. In straight and level flight n = 1 or : n = 0.47 / 0.47 A 3° increase in angle of attack, 3 * 0.1 = 0.3 Will give an increment of 0.3 in the CL : 0.47+0.3 = 0.77 A gust which increases the angle of attack by 3° will increase the load factor to : n = 0.77 / 0.47 ≈ 1.64g",

The tailplane provides the largest contribution toward damping in pitch, although other aircraft components such as the wings do assist. A graph of stick force versus load factor illustrates the manoeuvring stability of an aircraft. The gradient of the graph should be positive (with increasing load factor the stick force must also increase). This gradient must not be excessively high or the aircraft would be difficult and tiring to manoeuvre. Conversely, it should not be too low or the stick forces would be too light and the aircraft could be over-stressed. The maximum load factors which must be allowed for during maneuvers are shown in an envelope of load factor against speed (EAS). If a higher limit load factor is set by the manufacturer, there's more margin for the aircraft to be controlled inside the envelope and therefore a lower stick force per g may be set. Statement I is correct. The limit load factors will depend on the design category of the aircraft. For example, the limit load factor for modern high-speed jet transport aircraft is -1.0 g and 2.5 g. This value is stated in the Aircraft Flight Manual to be consulted by the pilot and should bever be exceeded. However, the stick force per g is not listed in the AFM. Statement II is incorrect.",

The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. It can be defined by: load factor(n) = (Lift(L))/(Weight(W)) In straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, thus n = 1. In this exercise, the increment in CL from a gust will be of 0.09 for every degree of angle of attack impacted by the gust. We also know that the aircraft encounters a gust which increases its angle of attack by 5°. In straight and level flight n = 1 or: n = (0.4)/(0.4) A 5° increase in angle of attack, 5*0.09 = 0.45 Will give an increment of 0.45 in the CL: 0.4+0.45 = 0.85 A gust which increases the angle of attack by 5° will increase the load factor to: n = 0.85/0.4 ≈ 2.13g",

TAS = EAS / √σ where, σ is Relative Density. The Airspeed Indicator is calibrated for ‘standard’ sea level density, so it will only read TAS if the density of the air through which the aircraft is flying is 1.225 kg/m3. Thus at 40 000 ft where the ‘standard’ density is one quarter of the sea-level value, to maintain the same EAS the aircraft will have to move through the air twice as fast. As altitude increases the TAS at any given CAS increases, so the effect of a vertical gust decreases. At 40 000 ft ISA for example, the TAS at constant EAS is about twice its sea level value.

Vold = 1.8VS nold = 1.9g Vnew = 2VS nnew =? The first thing we should do is check if in the first situation the aircraft is stalled, by comparing the two VS0: VS1 = VS0 x √(nold) VS1 = √1.9 x VS0 = 1.38VS0 1.38VS0 < 1.8VS0 Therefore, the aircraft is not stalled! As the aircraft does not stall in the first situation, we can calculate the load factor resulting from the same gust on an aircraft travelling at Vnew using a direct proportion: Vold x (nnew−1) = Vnew x (nold−1) nnew = ((Vnew x (nold−1)) / Vold) +1 nnew = ((2VS x (1.9−1)) / 1.8VS) +1 nnew = 2.00g Encountering the same gust with a speed of 2VS the load factor will be 2.00g. The last step of the exercise is to assess the limiting load factor at which the aircraft would stall and conclude if the new load factor calculated would be reached or the aircraft would stall before that. To do this, let us compare Vnew with the stall speed (VS) and load factor in straight and level flight (n1g): Vnew = VS * √(n1g From here results that our limiting load factor is: n1g = V2new n1g = 4.00g As our limiting load factor is higher than the new. In this case encountering the gust the aircraft would have its load factor increased to 2.00g without stalling.",

We have had to choose some figures to fit an answer, which are unlikely to be the same in the exam! Please send us any further exam feedback you can remember if you get this in your exam, so we can make it more exact, thank you! An aircraft has a limit load factor, that signifies the maximum G-force that the aircraft can handle, before potential damage may occur to the airframe. VA is an aircraft's manoeuvring speed, and exists where the aircraft can handle exactly its limit load factor before stalling. If the aircraft is flying slower than VA, then it will stall before reaching the limit load factor, and if it flying above VA, the limit load factor can be exceeded before stalling. We can therefore use VA in calculations, as it is the stall speed of an aircraft at it's limit load factor. Stall speed calculations are based on the lift force required by the wings, and that varies with weight and load factor (G-force). The higher the weight, or the higher the load factor, the higher airspeed that is required (more airflow makes the wing able to produce greater forces before stalling). For load factor, the formula is: New VS = VS(1G) x sqrt(load factor) Where VS(1G) is the stall speed at 1G (straight level flight) So for the manoeuvring speed VA = VS(1G) x sqrt(limit load factor) We can then re-arrange this to find the limit load factor if we know the VA and the VS(1G) (which we do in this question). The VS(1G) is given in the question as the bottom of the green arc. (VA / VS(1G))2 = limit load factor Limit load factor = (147/73)2 = 4.06 G",

Yellow This arc extends from VNO to VNE (never exceed speed), and denotes the cautionary speed range. Operations within this speed range should not be carried out except in smooth air. Red Radial line This line marks VNE. MANOEUVERING SPEED (VA) (figure 2) VA - Maximum design manoeuvring speed and is the highest speed where the aircraft will stall before it exceeds the maximum load factor THE STALL The CL of an aerofoil increases with angle of attack up to a maximum (CLMAX). Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALL RECOVERY To recover from a stall or prevent a full stall, the angle of attack must be decreased to reduce the adverse pressure gradient. This may consist of merely releasing back pressure, or it may be necessary to smoothly move the pitch control forward, depending on the aircraft design and severity of the stall. Allow airspeed to increase and recover lost altitude with moderate back pressure on the pitch control. Pulling too hard could trigger a secondary stall, or worse, could exceed the limit load factor and damage the aircraft structure. At low airspeeds the stall may occur before reaching the limit load factor. That is why, when pulling from a stall recovery, keeping the speed between VS and VA will allow us to not stall again due to the increased load factor. As angle of attack reduces below the critical angle, the adverse pressure gradient will decrease, airflow will re-attach, and lift and drag will return to their normal values.",

Flaps are incredibly useful for aircraft to allow for slower take-off and landing, as well as increasing drag for increased control during descent and approach phases of flight, and changing the landing pitch attitude of some aircraft. They do have to sustain some very high aerodynamic loads though, as they stick out into the airstream below the wing, and produce very high forces of lift and drag. The maximum speed for flaps extended (VFE) therefore exists to make sure the pilots do not fly too fast with flaps extended, and cause damage to the flaps or their mechanisms. Some large aircraft actually have systems to reduce the flap extension when these speed limits are broken. In this question then, during the approach phase of flight, the pilots will be wanting to extend flaps in preparation for landing, but if the speed is too high and the pilots extend flaps anyway, they may exceed the new (lower) VFE for the increased flap setting. As for the other options: VLO is the maximum speed for landing gear operation (it is often specified whether that is for extension or retraction) VMO is the maximum operating IAS for the aircraft. VS is the stall speed (not specified which).",

Figure 1 shows a typical maneuver envelope or V - n diagram. The limit load factors will depend on the design category of the aircraft. Point ‘D’ in is the design dive speed VD. This is the maximum speed which has to be considered when assessing the strength of the aircraft. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

We have recently changed the answer to this due to feedback. We find this question very odd, because \"0.9 x VD\" can be a range of values (as VD can be a range of values), and there are other factors to the calculation of VNE that you can see in the CS23 specifications below (CS25 aircraft do not have a VNE). Also, we think the examiner is very misleading to include \"VD\" as an option, as it is certainly correct (VNE is always less than VD), but is less specific than \"0.9 x VD\", making it tough to decide between \"less specific but absolutely correct\" and \"more specific but more complex to justify\" answers. Please keep on sending any exam feedback you have, and we will keep these questions as up to date as we can for you, thanks! Each type of aircraft has its own specific flight envelope, within which it can be safely operated in accordance with the EASA Certification Specifications. This is represented on a velocity against load factor, or V-n diagram. The high-speed limit for many (but not all) CS-23 aircraft is the never exceed speed (VNE) and is a design reference point for the aircraft beyond which the aircraft must not be flown. It provides a safety margin with the point at which structural damage or failure may occur(VD). VNE is the red radial line at the high speed end of the airspeed indicator. Never Exceed Speed VNE: VNE is set below VD to allow for speed upsets to be recovered before reaching any point of possible damage. VNE equals 0.9 x VD in most cases, but please see the regulation for this below, as there is some \"wiggle room\" in the regulation that makes things slightly more complex (hence our unhappiness with these options). CS 23.1505 - Airspeed Limitations (a) The never-exceed speed VNE must be established so that it is – (1) Not less than 0.9 times the minimum value of VD allowed under CS 23.335; and (2) Not more than the lesser of – (i) 0.9 VD established under CS 23.335; or (ii) 0.9 times the maximum speed shown under CS 23.251.",

Please let us know which you get in the exam, by placing feedback in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Aircraft can be certified under 2 different certification specifications; CS-23 or CS-25. CS-23 covers \"small aircraft\". This includes aircraft with MTOW of 5670 kg or less and a maximum operational passenger seating configuration (MOPSC) of 9 or fewer. CS-23 also covers commuter category aircraft up to 8618 kg MTOW and a MOPSC of 19 or fewer. This means that there are CS-23 aircraft with an MTOW above 5670 kg. CS-25 covers \"large aircraft\". Specifically, \"turbine powered Large Aeroplanes\". This includes turboprop aircraft as well as turbojet/turbofan (jet aircraft). There is a difference between the limiting flight airspeeds, VNE and VMO/MMO. Some aircraft (usually smaller, slower aircraft) use VNE - the never exceed speed, and a corresponding VNO, the normal operating speed, which should only be exceeded in smooth air (bottom of the yellow arc). Larger/faster aircraft use VMO/MMO - the maximum operating speed/maximum operating Mach number. This is calculated a little differently to VNE, and is a speed that should not be exceeded during normal operations. An aircraft either has VNE or VMO/MMO, never both. If an aircraft uses VMO, it will also have a corresponding MMO, but this is not mentioned in this question CS-23 aircraft mostly use VNE, but turbine powered aeroplanes and those with a particular design dive speed instead use a VMO/MMO (CS 23.1505). Therefore, CS-23 aircraft can use either VNE or VMO/MMO, depending on the particular aircraft. CS-25 aircraft only use VMO/MMO. Now we have enough information to go through each option: \"Only jet aeroplanes have a VMO.\" No, there are turboprop aircraft within CS-25 (and CS-23) that also have VMO, and even the possibility for piston aircraft to have VMO under CS-23 in some cases (CS 23.1505). \"VNE applies to all aircraft with an MTOW less than 5 670 kg.\" No, there are aircraft under 5 670 kg with more than 9 passenger seats that would be under CS-25 (and therefore have a VMO) and there are also aircraft within CS-23 that use VMO (CS 23.1505). \"VNE only applies to CS-23 aircraft but NOT to CS-25 aircraft.\" Yes, the majority of CS-23 aircraft use a VNE (but not all), and CS-25 aircraft only use VMO, so do not use VNE at all. \"VMO only applies to CS-25 aircraft but NOT to CS-23 aircraft.\" No. Whilst all CS-25 aircraft do use a VMO, so do some aircraft certified under CS-23 (turbines and certain piston aircraft [CS 23.1505])",

VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed.",

When that happens, then the amplitude will increase with each oscillation, up to a point where the amplitude is big enough to break things. Flutter is a very dangerous condition; if it is not stopped, it can cause structural failure and potentially lead to a fatal accident. There are four ways to stop flutter. Limit the flight envelope; immediately leave the speed at which flutter is possible Increase damping; this can be done by for instance adding some friction Increase stiffness; this reduces eigenfrequencies which makes flutter less likely Reduce mass; If a wing is made lighter, the eigenfrequency will move up, increasing flutter speeds.",

VA is the design manoeuvring speed at which the aircraft will stall when achieving its maximum load factor, i.e. it is the stalling speed of an aircraft at its Limit Load Factor (\"g\" limit) with flaps retracted. On an aircraft, where only one VA is published, maximum mass is assumed. In practice, like any stalling speed, VA will change during flight, decreasing as fuel is burnt and mass reduces. The significance of VA is that below this speed, the pilot can apply full elevator deflection and the aircraft will stall before reaching its \"g\" limit. But above VA, it becomes possible to exceed the \"g\" limit and there is risk of overstressing and deforming the airframe. For an aerobatic aircraft, the \"g\" limit is 6g. For this question, VA is given by the stall speed formula with flaps retracted: VA = VS1 x √(Limit Load Factor) = 57 x √6 = 140 kt.

            ],
            "explanation": "VA is the design manoeuvring speed of an aircraft. It is better depicted on a diagram of speed vs load factor (V - n diagram). The aircraft has a limiting load factor, an amount of acceleration that it can take without permanently damaging the airframe. Every aircraft also has a stalling curve, which dictates at what speed the aircraft will stall, when pulling a certain load factor. Put these two together on a diagram and you can see the V - n envelope of the aircraft, how fast we can fly and how many Gs we can pull at a particular speed. VA sits around where the positive stall curve touches the limit load factor. It dictates the point where you can pull the controls as hard as you want, and just as you reach the limit load factor (structural damage point), the aircraft will then stall, removing the chance of structural damage. Any slower and you will stall first, and any faster, and you could permanently damage the airframe. It is not always perfectly on that corner of the diagram, but that is past the scope of this question To look at all the options \"The speed for maximum gust velocity.\" No. The speed for maximum gust velocity is VB, and occurs just above the VA. It is the speed that the aircraft is certified to handle the highest level of gusts (66 fps). \"A specifically designated speed to use when penetrating turbulence.\" The turbulence penetration speed is actually VB also, where the strongest gusts can be handled by the aircraft without stalling or damage occurring. \"A speed chosen by the manufacturer for evaluating performance criteria.\" There are many different speed to evaluate performance criteria with, but they would never use VA, as it is not usually anywhere near speeds such as best range, minimum drag, etc. \"The design manoeuvring speed, at or near which rapid, full control reversal should be avoided due to risk of damage to aircraft.\" Whilst the wording is (intentionally) poor for this option, it is the only one left. We believe that the \"control reversal\" would just mean going from one full deflection to the other side full deflection. That is really not advisable at any speed, but at and above VA would cause damage to the aircraft. Even just below VA, full control deflection from no deflection is fine (though you may stall), but reversal is not accounted for in the regulations, so in reality the examiner can say what they like to try and confuse you. This is the only remaining option, and correctly stated that it is the design manoeuvring speed, so we are happy to agree that it is most correct.",

The aircraft has a limiting load factor, an amount of acceleration that it can take without permanently damaging the airframe. Every aircraft also has a stalling curve, which dictates at what speed the aircraft will stall, when pulling a certain load factor. Put these two together on a diagram and you can see the V - n envelope of the aircraft, how fast we can fly and how many Gs we can pull at a particular speed, either limited by aerodynamic stall or by the structural limit load factor. VA sits around where the positive stall curve touches the limit load factor. It dictates the point where you can pull the controls as hard as you want, and just as you reach the limit load factor (structural damage point), the aircraft will then stall, removing the chance of structural damage. Any slower and you will stall first, and any faster, and you could permanently damage the airframe. It is not always perfectly on that corner of the diagram, but that is past the scope of this question. If the mass of an aircraft increases, it means that the aircraft requires more lift, and therefore the stall speed increases. When the stall speed increases, so does the manoeuvring speed (VA) by the same proportion. The design limit load factor, however, is fixed for an aircraft by the manufacturer, at a certain G-loading.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 081.06.02.02.03: Explain why VA loses significance at higher altitude. Manoeuvring speed (VA) is defined as the calibrated airspeed (CAS) below which the aircraft will stall before the onset of structural damage or aerodynamic buffeting occurs. It is a function of the aircraft's weight, altitude, and the configuration of the aircraft (flap and landing gear positions). VA is calculated based on EAS, which is the airspeed corrected for instrument and position errors. When jet transports cruise at high altitude, the significance of manoeuvring speed (VA) diminishes since it is not possible to achieve 2.5 g, or similar load factors, at high altitude. Consequently, when a single VA is published, it only applies to low-level flight. As altitude increases, the values of equivalent airspeed (EAS) that correspond to the same Mach numbers increase. The increase in Mach number results in a reduction in CLMAX, and the stall limit curves become shallower, causing both VS1 and VA to occur at higher EAS values. The increased stall speed (VS) means that the low altitude VA is around the low-speed stall at high altitude. Therefore, the option \"higher stall speed and low control forces make it easier to produce a high load factor at high altitudes.\" is more likely correct, as flying the low altitude VA at high altitudes may result in a low-speed stall of a typical jet aircraft rather than a shock stall.

This brings the centre of gravity of the control forward to a position on, or slightly in front of the hinge, but always to the point required by the designers. This reduces the inertia moments about the hinge and prevents flutter developing.",

We are in need of more feedback about this one, so please send us anything you can remember from the exam via the comments, the feedback section of the website, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct or not. Authority Reported Answer Hungary Not C Poland B Austro Not D We would say if your country is not Hungary or Poland, go for C. FLUTTER Flutter occurs because a wing (or other aerodynamic surface) is not perfectly stiff, and will bend and twist under high aerodynamic loads. The control surfaces can cause a cyclic movement where the wing moves but the control surface \"lags behind\", creating an even larger force on the wing. The wing will then do the same thing in the opposite direction, and at certain frequencies can build up to a large, short term oscillation that can cause significant damage ton the aircraft. The risk of experiencing flutter increases with IAS. A control surface oscillation can also be intensified or created by any slack (free play) in the control lines, where the control surface can move freely without pilot input. This means that small disturbances such as turbulence could cause un-commanded control surface movements, which then begin a period of flutter, as eluded to in the question. To go through the options: \"This phugoid-type oscillation is likely to increase in magnitude and the aeroplane may enter a stall or encounter an overspeed situation if the oscillation worsens.\" It is not a phugoid type oscillation being described, as a phugoid has a greater time period than this short interval flutter. \"A poorly balanced control surface is creating excessive restoring forces and this short-period motion may cause excessive stress on the airframe.\" The control surface is not necessarily poorly balanced; the cause of the flutter is the free play in the control lines, so we would say this is not correct. However, the rest of the option is correct, so it's not far off. \"The flutter may gradually worsen, and the elevator may vibrate so vigorously that it comes off the hinges and separates from the aeroplane in flight.\" We believe this is fully correct. The free play in the control lines can cause this kind of response. \"Compared to a phugoid, the short period motion leads to a change in pitch and speed, which, if NOT corrected, may lead to a stall or overspeed situation.\" For a while, the Polish ULC considered this to be correct (we believe), but recent feedback indicates they no longer do. The short period motion doesn't really cause large speed changes (that would be a phugoid) and therefore it is not very likely to cause a stall or overspeed situation.",

If the aircraft is flying slower than VA, then it will stall before reaching the limit load factor, and if it flying above VA, the limit load factor can be exceeded before stalling. We can therefore use VA in calculations, as it is the stall speed of an aircraft at it's limit load factor. Stall speed calculations are based on the lift force required by the wings, and that varies with weight and load factor (G-force). The higher the weight, or the higher the load factor, the higher airspeed that is required (more airflow makes the wing able to produce greater forces before stalling). For load factor, the formula is: New VS = VS(1G) x sqrt(load factor) Where VS(1G) is the stall speed at 1G (straight level flight) So for the manoeuvring speed VA = VS(1G) x sqrt(limit load factor) We can then re-arrange this to find the limit load factor if we know the VA and the VS(1G) (which we do in this question). The VS(1G) is given in the question as the bottom of the green arc. (VA / VS(1G))2 = limit load factor Limit load factor = (133/73)2 = 3.3 G",

All aircraft have limitations to their speed and the loads that they can sustain at those speeds. In particular, we have to know about the load/speed diagram for CS-25 (large) aeroplanes. There is a diagram for the maximum load factors (positive and negative) that an aircraft can sustain, whether that limit was to do with a stall limit, or a structural load factor limit. There is also a limiting gust envelope diagram for the maximum gusts an aircraft must be able to handle at various speeds, see annex above. This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. To keep the aircraft within safe operation, the VMO (maximum operating speed) must be kept below VC. This is still very fast, and should not be exceeded in normal operations.",

The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. It can be defined by: load factor(n) = (Lift(L))/(Weight(W)) In straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, thus n = 1. In this exercise, the increment in CL from a gust will be of 0.079 for every degree of angle of attack impacted by the gust. We also know that the aircraft encounters a gust which increases its angle of attack by 2°. In straight and level flight n = 1 or: n = 0.35/0.35 A 2° increase in angle of attack, 2*0.079 = 0.158 Will give an increment of 0.45 in the CL: 0.35+0.158 = 0.508 A gust which increases the angle of attack by 2° will increase the load factor to: n = 0.508/0.35 ≈ 1.45 g",

The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft. For a given TAS and gust speed, the increase of lift will be proportional to the wing area. Therefore, the increase in load factor is inversely proportional to the wing loading. WingLoading = Weight/(WingArea) Decreasing mass, decreases wing loading which increases load factor. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. With increasing altitude, density decreases and any aerodynamic force resulting from a gust will be smaller. Thus, when comparing two aircraft flying at different altitudes, the one flying in thinner air (higher altitude) will experience a decreased increment in load factor following a gust. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

In the descent the reverse is true. Your maximum speed is controlled by MMO first, and then by VMO at lower altitudes. Alternatively, LSS increases during the descent, due to the rising temperature. Therefore, TAS must increase during descent to maintain constant Mach No. IAS is also increasing and will eventually reach its limit.

This includes aircraft with MTOW of 5670 kg or less and a maximum operational passenger seating configuration (MOPSC) of 9 or fewer. CS-23 also covers commuter category aircraft up to 8618 kg MTOW and a MOPSC of 19 or fewer. This means that there are CS-23 aircraft with an MTOW above 5670 kg. CS-25 covers \"large aircraft\". Specifically, \"turbine powered Large Aeroplanes\". This includes turboprop aircraft as well as turbojet/turbofan (jet aircraft). There is a difference between the limiting flight airspeeds, VNE and VMO/MMO. Some aircraft (usually smaller, slower aircraft) use VNE - the never exceed speed, and a corresponding VNO, the normal operating speed, which should only be exceeded in smooth air (bottom of the yellow arc). Larger/faster aircraft use VMO/MMO - the maximum operating speed/maximum operating Mach number. This is calculated a little differently to VNE, and is a speed that should not be exceeded during normal operations. An aircraft either has VNE or VMO/MMO, never both. If an aircraft uses VMO, it will also have a corresponding MMO, but this is not mentioned in this question CS-23 aircraft mostly use VNE, but turbine powered aeroplanes and those with a particular design dive speed instead use a VMO/MMO (CS 23.1505). Therefore, CS-23 aircraft can use either VNE or VMO/MMO, depending on the particular aircraft. CS-25 aircraft only use VMO/MMO.",

It is not less than the stalling speed with the flaps retracted multiplied by the square root of the limiting load factor at a speed of VC. VA is not shown on the ASI, but it should be placarded close to the ASI. For a normal category light airplane having a maximum load factor of 3.8g then: VA = VS1G ∗ √3.8 = 1.95VS1G If only one value of VA is quoted, then it is the speed at which the airplane will stall at the maneuvering load factor at the MTOM. Because of this, a change of mass causes the value of VA to alter by a percentage amount equal to approximately half of the percentage mass change. An alternative calculation that may be required because of a mass change is that: VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √( (New Mass) / (Original Mass) ) In this exercise, the ‘New Mass’ is 20% smaller than the ‘Original Mass’, which is the same as saying that New Mass=80% Original Mass. VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √( (0.8∗Original Mass) / (Original Mass) ) VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √0.8 VA(New Mass) ≈ 0.9VA(Original Mass) The new VA with a mass 20% smaller corresponds to 90% of the original VA, i.e. VA will decrease by approximately 10%.",

VLO and VLE refer to landing gear: VLE - Maximum landing gear extended speed. The maximum IAS that should be flown if the landing gear are extended. VLO - Maximum landing gear operating speed. The maximum IAS at which the landing gear should be extended or retracted (sometimes there are separate speed for extension and retraction). The operation of the landing gear is often more susceptible to input from the aerodynamic loads than when the gear is fully extended and locked. In particular, the gear doors may have to move within the airflow, or the gear may have to be raised or lowered into the oncoming airflow. For example, in the common multi-engine trainer, the DA42, the nose gear extends backwards, and raises forwards into the airflow. The VLE and VLO (extend) are the same, but the VLO (retract) is around 40 kts lower, as the aerodynamic loads would be working against the hydraulic system when raising into the airflow.",

Despite the engine failing the airplane still has forward speed, for a single-engine airplane due to the glide descent the forward speed causes the propeller to have a negative angle of attack due to the direction of the relative airflow. This angle of attack generates sufficient torque to rotate the unpowered propeller in the normal direction of rotation. The component of the force at right angles to the plane of rotation now acts rearwards and is no longer thrust but is now drag and presents a flat disc to the direction of travel. Because the propeller is being driven only by the relative airflow it is said to be wind milling. As such, it causes a considerable amount of drag, reduces the IAS, reduces the Lift/Drag ratio and increases the rate of descent.",

This can severely limit the cruise speed of aircraft with fixed pitch props, and therefore, aircraft are equipped with different pitch props based on their expected use-cases. slow training aircraft are equipped with fine pitch \"climb\" propellers and cruise focussed aircraft are equipped with coarser \"cruise\" propellers, so they are most capable in their expected speed range. Constant speed (variable pitch) propellers do not have the same disadvantages, as they can change their blade angle to have a much greater band of maximum efficiency. They will therefore be fine for take-off and low speeds, but the constant speed unit will increase the blade angle to keep it more efficient at higher true airspeeds. Therefore, when brakes are released on take-off, the propeller starts getting more efficient as it accelerates, until the propeller angle of attack reaches its optimum, and then after that, the propeller can be made to stay at optimum efficiency after this, in the climb and up to a much higher cruise TAS. The only problem here is that the graph above shows the \"optimum\" band as being not quite level. This is the case due to a few factors, such as the propeller twist being optimum at a certain speed, etc., but we think that this small effect is not what the examiner is asking about, particularly for the speed range discussed in the question.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question was generated based on feedback which was posted on question 813311. Propellers generate 4 main secondary effects on an aircraft: Torque effect Gyroscopic precession Slipstream Asymmetric blade effect For this question, we can go through each statement and check whether the effect is correct or not for the scenario. 1. SLIPSTREAM The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling anti-clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the right hand side, causing a tail-left, nose-right moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the right. Statement 1 is incorrect. 2. TORQUE EFFECT The anti-clockwise rotating propeller gains more anti-clockwise rotational momentum when the pilot adds thrust (higher RPM), so the aircraft experiences the opposite (clockwise) rotation, and is rolled to the right (this can be corrected using left aileron). Statement 1 is correct. 3. GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause an forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the right of the propeller disc. This creates a yaw to the left. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. 4. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, so the thrust line of this anti-clockwise propeller is to the left of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (left of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the right. Statement 4 is correct.",

(this can be a negative force when windmilling or providing reverse thrust). There are also a few different moments (bending/twisting forces on the propeller blades) Torque bending force - causing the tips to lag behind the blade hubs due to the torque force. Thrust bending force - bending the edges of the propeller disc in the direction of flight due to the thrust force. Centrifugal twisting moment (CTM) - twisting the propeller to the \"fine\" direction due to the centrifugal pulling force on the blade (trying to flatten the blade onto the plane of rotation). Aerodynamic twisting moment (ATM) - twisting the propeller to the \"coarse\" direction (unless windmilling) due to the location of the centre of pressure ahead of the point of rotation. The torque bending moment and thrust bending force are not usually asked in the exams, but the CTM and ATMs are a larger part of the syllabus (though still very rare). Between the CTM and the ATM, they work in opposite directions and CTM is stronger (except when the propeller is windmilling when they work in the same direction (both to \"fine\")). In this case, the CTM (Centrifugal Twisting Moment) is the correct answer as it tries to decrease the blade pitch angle (make the blade more fine).",

This then means that the down-swinging (right) blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to the right of the engine centre line. If both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the left with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude. This effect will be greatest at full power and low airspeed.",

The main causes of this are: Slipstream effect Torque reaction Gyroscopic effect Asymmetric blade effect ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT (figure 1) This effect occurs when the axis of rotation of the propeller is inclined to the direction of flight. For example, when the tail wheel on a tail-dragger type aircraft is in contact with the ground, its longitudinal axis inclines above the horizontal. This causes the down-going blade to have a greater effective angle of attack than the up-going blade, thus developing greater thrust. The thrust asymmetry between the two blades causes the aircraft to yaw to the left. GYROSCOPIC EFFECT (figure 2) A rotating propeller has the properties of a gyroscope - rigidity in space and precession. The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Note: Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up. Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down.",

That engine failure which most adversely affects the performance is deemed the critical power unit and is used to determine the limiting control speeds that will ensure adequate directional control in such an event. During a crosswind take-off an airplane tends to weathercock into wind. Because of this the failure of the outboard engine on the windward side of the airplane is the most difficult to counteract and is, therefore, the critical engine for jet-propelled aircraft. For propeller-driven airplanes the direction of propeller rotation determines the critical engine. Viewed from behind, a clockwise rotation dictates that the outboard left engine is critical.",

The Asymmetric blade effect is more significant in situations of high power (RPM) and low forward speed, such as take-off or low speed climbs. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. This effect occurs when the axis of rotation of the propeller is inclined to the direction of flight. For example, when the tail wheel on a tail-dragger type aircraft is in contact with the ground, its longitudinal axis inclines above the horizontal. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. This causes the down-going blade to have a greater effective angle of attack than the up-going blade, thus developing greater thrust. The thrust asymmetry between the two blades causes the aircraft to yaw to the left on take-off. Conversely, if an aircraft is flying yawed, then the asymmetry of the thrust causes a pitching moment.",

A left turning tendency would then occur. In contrast, small twins with counter-rotating propellers can reduce torque reaction after an engine failure. In this configuration, the propeller on the left-hand engine (Engine nr.1) rotates clockwise, while the one on the right-hand engine (Engine nr.2) rotates counter-clockwise. The primary advantage lies in balancing torque and P-factor effects, ensuring there is no critical engine in the event of failure.

In addition, the weight of the ice increases the aircraft weight and therefore the lift required.

It is usually referenced at 75% of the blade radius measured from the center of the shaft. A small blade angle is called “fine pitch”. A large blade angle is called “coarse pitch”.",

The blades of the propeller are small aerodynamic aerofoils mounted vertically on a horizontal shaft that is rotated by either a piston engine or a turbine-driven engine. BLADE ANGLE (PITCH) The angle between the blade chord and the plane of rotation. ANGLE OF ATTACK The path of the propeller through the air determines the direction of the relative airflow. The angle between the blade chord and the relative airflow is the angle of attack (α). The angle of attack (α) is the result of propeller rotational velocity (RPM) and aircraft forward velocity (TAS). Because the rotational velocity of the blade increases with distance from the propeller shaft and the fact that the aeroplane is moving forward, then the angle of attack of the blade varies at different distances from the shaft. FIXED PITCH PROPELLER The blade angle of a fixed-pitch propeller is constant but the helix angle and the angle of attack will vary according to its forward speed. To ensure its efficient operation the blade angle of attack of a fixed-pitch propeller must be close to the optimum and is that which produces the greatest excess of horizontal lift (thrust) over drag. To operate the propeller in this manner will restrict the range of speeds within which the aeroplane can function. Thus, the blade angle selected during the design of the aeroplane is dependent on the operational requirements for that aeroplane. Figure shows a “fixed pitch” propeller at constant RPM. Increasing TAS decreases the angle of attack of the propeller.",

Veriable pitch propellers permit high efficiency to be obtained over a wider range of TAS, giving improved take-off and climb performance and cruising fuel consumption.

This effect occurs when the axis of rotation of the propeller is inclined to the direction of flight. For example, when the tail wheel on a tail-dragger type aircraft is in contact with the ground, its longitudinal axis inclines above the horizontal. This causes the down-going blade to have a greater effective angle of attack than the up-going blade, thus developing greater thrust. The thrust asymmetry between the two blades causes the aircraft to yaw to the left on take-off. Conversely, if an aircraft is flying yawed, then the asymmetry of the thrust causes a pitching moment.",

At high propeller speeds and low forward speed (as in the take-offs and approaches to power-on stalls), this spiralling rotation is very compact and exerts a strong sideward force on the aircraft’s vertical tail surface. When this spiralling slipstream strikes the vertical fin, it causes a yawing moment about the aircraft’s vertical axis. The more compact the spiral, the more prominent this force is. As the forward speed increases, however, the spiral elongates and becomes less effective. The corkscrew flow of the slipstream also causes a rolling moment around the longitudinal axis. GYROSCOPIC EFFECT (figure 2) A rotating propeller has the properties of a gyroscope - rigidity in space and precession. The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Note: Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up. Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down.",

The wing with the operational engine produces more lift than the wing with the \"dead\" engine, causing a tendency for the aircraft to roll towards the inoperative engine. The aircraft's ability to climb is significantly compromised. Failure to feather the propeller exacerbates the situation by intensifying yawing forces and further diminishing climbing capability due to increased drag. Feathering the propeller is typically essential for multi-engine aircraft, as windmilling (unfeathered) propellers induce higher drag compared to non-rotating propellers. Feathering the propeller reduces drag as only parasite drag of the propeller exists which is much smaller than induced and parasite drag and energy absorbed to rotate the engine if the propeller is windmilling.",

Consequently, the down-going propeller blade experiences a greater effective angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, owing to a slight relative forward movement. This results in the down-going (right) blade generating slightly more thrust. As a consequence, the line of thrust shifts right of the propeller cone. Consequently, the left thrust arm is smaller than the right thrust arm. The difference in thrust on both sides of the propeller disc induces a yawing moment to the left when the propeller rotates clockwise in a nose-up attitude. This phenomenon, known as asymmetric blade effect or P-factor, is most pronounced at full power and low airspeed, primarily due to the high angle of attack experienced during takeoff, climb, and go-around maneuvers. Note: The gyroscopic precession of the propeller results in a force applied perpendicular to the plane of rotation appearing to act 90° in the direction of rotation. When the aircraft turns left, a force is applied to the propeller on the right-hand side when viewed from behind. This force, appearing 90° later in this scenario, would be at the bottom of the propeller, causing the aircraft to pitch up.",

Figure 2 Shows the conditions at high forward speed in level flight. As the TAS increased, the CSU continually increased the blade angle (coarsened the pitch) to maintain a constant blade angle of attack. In a steady glide with no shaft power from the engine (throttle closed), if the propeller pitch is decreased by pushing forward the prop’ lever, the aircraft Lift/Drag ratio will decrease.

The propeller tips are therefore going much faster than the blade root, and this is all lateral speed (i.e. not forwards speed). The forwards speed of airflow into the propeller is the same for all sections of the blade, but the lateral speed of the propeller varies massively along the length of the blade. This means the angle of the oncoming airflow is very different for the propeller tip as for the root (near the hub). For this reason, the propeller blade is twisted very significantly between the root and the tip, in order to make sure that the angle of attack remains roughly constant along the length of the blade. The root of the propeller has a very large blade angle and the tip has a much smaller blade angle, but - at the optimum RPM and forwards speed (TAS) - the angle of attack of the whole propeller should be close to the optimum angle of attack. As for the other options, neither the root nor the tip produces most thrust, it is maximum around 75% radius. The root is travelling too slowly to produce much thrust and tip losses means that the thrust drops off in that region also.",

Assuming that propeller RPM and blade pitch angle remains constant, at a low speed the angle of attack will be large, giving a lot of thrust. Alpha will reduce with increasing speed and at about 4 degrees the blade will be operating at its best lift/drag ratio, i.e. the propeller is achieving its highest efficiency. Higher speeds (maybe in a dive) will reduce the blade angle of attack to its zero lift value of about minus 4 degrees. At this point, the propeller will be producing zero thrust. The thrust that is produced by the propeller depends on the angle of attack of the blade. The angle of attack of the blade depends in turn on the airspeed and induced airflow through the propeller. At low airspeeds the angle of attack will be large, near the stall, and thrust will be at its maximum. As forward speed increases, the angle of attack decreases and thrust reduces. That means that the maximum thrust produced by a propeller driven aircraft, also occurs at zero forward airspeed and reduces with forward speed. A fixed propeller can only have one optimum combination of forward airspeed and engine RPM and only one optimum propeller efficiency. At all other combinations it operates less efficiently. This effect can be offset to an extent by using a variable pitch propeller, coarsening the blade angle at higher speeds to maintain the optimum angle of attack.",

The purpose of this is to reduce drag from the propeller, as the assumption is that the engine has failed in flight, and therefore maximising thrust and reducing drag is necessary to maintain the best possible climb performance. By turning the propeller to the feathered position, there is the minimum frontal area to produce drag, and the propeller is not inclined to rotate, which is the \"windmilling\" tendency that propellers have: Not only is this bad for drag, it is also bad for continuing to turn the engine and potentially causing further damage or spreading a possible fire, etc. For a single-engine airplane, feathering the propeller blades improves the glide performance due to lower drag, however, having the blade at a fine pitch setting would be better if a restart is to be attempted. As such, feathering the propeller may be used to increase the gliding range/endurance, if it is available. For a multi-engine airplane, the decreased drag improves climb performance, but is also good for reducing the amount of yaw. As the drag of the failed engine propeller acts in the same direction as the thrust asymmetry, getting rid of this extra drag by feathering the propeller makes the thrust asymmetry a little easier to counteract, and this is quite noticeable when doing engine failure training on a twin propeller aircraft. Therefore, the answer is that the left yaw is reduced (not removed completely, of course).",

            "explanation": "Propellers generate 4 main secondary effects on an aircraft: Torque effect Gyroscopic precession Slipstream Asymmetric blade effect For this question, we can go through each statement and check whether the effect is correct or not for the scenario. TORQUE EFFECT The anti-clockwise rotating propeller gains more anti-clockwise rotational momentum when the pilot adds thrust (higher RPM), so the aircraft experiences the opposite (clockwise) rotation, and is rolled to the right (this can be corrected using left aileron). GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause an forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the right of the propeller disc. This creates a yaw to the left. SLIPSTREAM EFFECT The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling anti-clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the right hand side, causing a tail-left, nose-right moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the right. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, so the thrust line of this anti-clockwise propeller is to the left of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (left of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the right. Note: Asymmetric blade effect and gyroscopic precession come into play at rotation. One could argue that slipstream effect could also be an option. However, according to feedback, “torque effect” was the correct answer.",

Alpha will reduce with increasing speed and at about 4 degrees the blade will be operating at its best lift/drag ratio, i.e. the propeller is achieving its highest efficiency. Higher speeds (maybe in a dive) will reduce the blade angle of attack to its zero lift value of about minus 4 degrees. At this point, the propeller will be producing zero thrust. The thrust that is produced by the propeller depends on the angle of attack of the blade. The angle of attack of the blade depends in turn on the airspeed and induced airflow through the propeller. At low airspeeds the angle of attack will be large, near the stall, and thrust will be at its maximum. As forward speed increases, the angle of attack decreases and thrust reduces. That means that the maximum thrust produced by a propeller driven aircraft, also occurs at zero forward airspeed and reduces with forward speed.",

Because the engines of a propeller-driven airplane have to be mounted on the wing sufficiently far from the fuselage to account the necessary propeller clearance then these airplanes always experience a large yawing moment when an engine fails that may be difficult to control. This is not so with a jet airplane because the wing-mounted engines on these airplanes can be mounted relatively close to the fuselage thus creating a relatively short moment arm, which produces a small yawing moment that is easier to control. In such a situation the propeller-driven airplane also has a greater tendency to roll than the jet-propelled airplane. On suffering an engine failure, the unbalanced thrust and drag produces a yawing moment that must be counteracted by the deflection of the rudder. The side force generated by the rudder deflection when multiplied by the moment arm (the distance that the center of pressure of the rudder is from the CG) has to produce a counteracting moment equal to and opposite to the yawing moment.",

This seems like the worst in our opinion, but at least all the other options are significantly incorrect, so it makes it easy enough to answer, even if not truly correct. This could show up differently in the exam anyway, so as long as you know the simple theory behind it, you should have no problem. The efficiency of any system is determined by the ratio of the output power to the input power. The force developed by the engine and delivered to the propeller via the shaft is the rotational force of the propeller, the propeller torque. The power delivered from the shaft to the propeller (input power) is the product of the torque and the angular velocity of the propeller shaft (Torque × RPM). The thrust developed by the propeller is the product of the mass of air moved and the acceleration given to it by the propeller. The power developed by the propeller is the product of the thrust and the TAS (Thrust × Axial Speed). Propeller efficiency is the ratio of the propeller output power developed to the engine power delivered (input power). A well-designed propeller is typically 80% efficient when operating at its optimum blade angle of attack. Of course, this question doesn't have that as an option, so the closest option is \"Thrust produced to power input\". The ratio is therefore not correct, as thrust is not power output, they different by a factor of the true airspeed, but it's the closest they have given us. Why they keep using thrust to describe the output of a propeller, we have no idea, as a whole branch of PoF is to do with the fact we only measure propeller power, not thrust. As for the other options: \"power input to fuel consumption\" is a measure of the engine efficiency. \"airspeed to thrust produced\" is not really a useful measure of anything. \"torque to rotational speed\" is not a useful measure either. When these two are multiplied together, they get the input power, but as a ratio, they are useless to us.",

This blade position stops the propeller from rotating because there is no lift force to produce a torque reaction; it reduces the drag to a minimum level and prevents damage being caused to the engine. For a single-engine airplane feathering the propeller blades improves the glide performance because it does not require such a steep glide angle to maintain the required airspeed. As such, feathering the propeller increases the gliding range and endurance. For a multi-engine airplane, the decreased drag reduces the amount of thrust required to counteract the asymmetric force of the propeller of the failed engine and there is sufficient rudder authority remaining to enable the pilot to safely control the airplane.",

The angle of attack of a fixed-pitch propeller increases with increased RPM and/or decreased TAS. Maximum propeller efficiency for any given RPM occurs at only one TAS and the blade angle of attack for that RPM increases with decreased TAS. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The purpose of a variable-pitch propeller is to either manually or automatically maintain the optimum angle of attack to maximize the lift/drag ratio of the propeller as the airplane speed changes. This characteristic is the most significant advantage of the constant-speed (fixed RPM) propeller over the fixed-pitch propeller because it is able to maintain maximum efficiency over a range of airplane speeds.

The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Gyroscopic Effect is more significant in situations of high power (RPM) and low forward speed, such as take-off or low speed climbs. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw.

This blade position stops the propeller from rotating because there is no lift force to produce a torque reaction; it reduces the drag to a minimum level and prevents damage being caused to the engine. For a single-engine airplane feathering the propeller blades improves the glide performance because it does not require such a steep glide angle to maintain the required airspeed. As such, feathering the propeller increases the gliding range and endurance. For a multi-engine airplane, the decreased drag reduces the amount of thrust required to counteract the asymmetric force of the propeller of the failed engine and there is sufficient rudder authority remaining to enable the pilot to safely control the airplane.",

            "explanation": "Ice on an aerofoil changes its properties, reducing lift and increasing drag for a given angle of attack. Ice on a propeller blade reduces the efficiency of the propeller and reduces thrust. In the same way, as the drag of an ice contaminated airplane increases, the resisting force on the propeller increases for a given rpm and blade angle. Ice separating from the propeller blades, as well as vibration due to propeller imbalance, may cause damage to the airplane structure. Since ice on the propeller blades reduces the available thrust, extra power may be required from the engine to overcome the increased drag, decreasing propeller efficiency. Note: Propeller icing can be expected to reduce propeller efficiency by up to 10% normally, but could up to 20% in very severe icing. Propeller icing occurs on the leading edge, but is least at the tip of the blade, where the high rotational speed tends to shed the ice more easily. For that reason, icing will be reduced by INCREASING propeller rpm, not reducing it. The loss of aircraft performance in icing conditions is mainly due to ice formation on the rest of the wings and airframe, with a smaller contribution coming from the propeller icing.",

A propeller is a fan, fitted with between two and six aerodynamic blades that is used to convert rotational motion into forward thrust for the propulsion of an aeroplane through the air. The blades of the propeller are small aerodynamic aerofoils mounted vertically on a horizontal shaft that is rotated by either a piston engine or a turbine-driven engine. BLADE ANGLE (PITCH) The angle between the blade chord and the plane of rotation. ANGLE OF ATTACK The path of the propeller through the air determines the direction of the relative airflow. The angle between the blade chord and the relative airflow is the angle of attack (α). The angle of attack (α) is the result of propeller rotational velocity (RPM) and aircraft forward velocity (TAS). Because the rotational velocity of the blade increases with distance from the propeller shaft and the fact that the aeroplane is moving forward, then the angle of attack of the blade varies at different distances from the shaft. CONSTANT SPEED PROPELLER The purpose of a variable-pitch propeller is to either manually or automatically maintain the optimum angle of attack to maximize the lift/drag ratio of the propeller as the aeroplane speed changes. Constant-speed propellers enable the pilot to select the RPM for maximum power or maximum efficiency and a propeller governor varies the propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected RPM. FIGURE 1 The diagram shows the conditions during the early stages of the take-off roll. The RPM is set to maximum and the TAS is low. The angle of attack is optimum and maximum available efficiency is obtained. As the aircraft continues to accelerate, the TAS will increase, which decreases the angle of attack of the blades. Less thrust will be generated and less propeller torque. This gives less resistance for the engine to overcome and RPM would tend to increase. The propeller governor senses the RPM increase and increases pitch to maintain the blade angle of attack constant. FIGURE 2 The diagram shows conditions when the engine and propeller have been set for cruise conditions. Optimum throttle and RPM settings are listed in the aircraft Flight Manual. Whatever configuration into which the aircraft is placed, climb, descent or bank, the CSU will adjust the blade angle (propeller pitch) to maintain the RPM which has been set. At least it will try to maintain constant RPM.",

When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Note: Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. For a anti-clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up. Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down.

            "explanation": "Note: This is similar to question 814917 but without the story in the question Let's start by considering the roll of the aircraft, it is mainly just affected by the torque effect. TORQUE EFFECT This occurs primarily because the air resists the motion of the propeller. In so doing, it tends to twist the engine and airframe in the opposite direction to the propeller (i.e. anti-clockwise). This causes the aircraft to roll to the left and is particularly noticeable in a go-around scenario, where the airspeed over the ailerons is low, and maximum power is applied, not only causing a large increase in torque effect but also the rotational acceleration of the propeller provides a further effect. So that's why the aircraft will roll to the left in this scenario. But the yaw is, unfortunately, a little more complicated as there are a few extra factors at play, in fact almost all the secondary effects are here. The asymmetric blade effect (P-factor) will cause a yaw to the left; The gyroscopic precession causes a smaller, temporary yaw to the right whilst pitching up; The slipstream effect causes an increased yaw to the left; and Therefore, overall the aircraft yaws to the left, hence the need for more right rudder than you expect if you've trained in an aircraft with a clockwise rotating propeller, which is highly likely. SLIPSTREAM The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the left hand side, causing a tail-right, nose-left moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the left. GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause a forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the left of the propeller disc, which is a transient yaw to the right. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, due to a higher angle of attack, so the thrust line of this clockwise propeller is to the right of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (right of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the left.",

These are due to several different causes: Torque reaction, Gyroscopic precession, Spiral (asymmetric) slipstream effect and Asymmetric blade effect. Torque reaction. A counter-clockwise rotating propeller produces a clockwise moment that must be counteracted by ailerons. During take-off this will apply a greater down load to the left wheel, causing more rolling resistance on the left wheel making the aircraft want to yaw to the left. Gyroscopic precession. Propeller can also be considered a gyroscope as it is a certain mass, which is rotating. Gyroscopes want to maintain their plane of rotation. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. if an aircraft with a clockwise rotating propeller is pitched nose-up, imagine that a forward force has been applied to the bottom of the propeller disc. The force will “emerge” at 90° in the direction of rotation, i.e. a right yawing moment. Spiral Slipstream. As the propeller rotates it produces a backward flow of air, or slipstream, which rotates around the aircraft. This spiral slipstream causes a change in airflow around the fin (vertical stabilizer). Due to the direction of propeller rotation (clockwise) the spiral slipstream meets the fin at an angle from the left, producing a sideways force on the fin to the right.",

To ensure its efficient operation the blade angle of attack of a fixed-pitch propeller must be close to the optimum and is that which produces the greatest excess of horizontal lift (thrust) over drag. A large blade angle or coarse pitch is suitable for high-speed flight (cruise). The geometric pitch is the distance the propeller would travel forward in one complete revolution if it were moving through the air at the blade angle. The higher the blade angle the higher the geometric pitch. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. In low forward speed flight, the angle of attack is large. This produces a large amount of thrust but at the same time it creates a large amount of drag. To maintain a constant RPM, it is essential to overcome the drag and that requires a high propeller torque. The propeller efficiency in these circumstances is low. By increasing the speed, the helix angle increases. Although the angle of attack of is smaller and less thrust is produced the amount of drag induced is significantly less, this makes the propeller efficiency proportionately greater. It is this speed that attains the greatest propeller efficiency. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

This blade position stops the propeller from rotating because there is no lift force to produce a torque reaction; it reduces the drag to a minimum level and prevents damage being caused to the engine. For a single-engine airplane feathering the propeller blades improves the glide performance because it does not require such a steep glide angle to maintain the required airspeed. As such, feathering the propeller increases the gliding range and endurance. For a multi-engine airplane, the decreased drag reduces the amount of thrust required to counteract the asymmetric force of the propeller of the failed engine and there is sufficient rudder authority remaining to enable the pilot to safely control the airplane.",

The main causes of this are: Slipstream effect Torque reaction Gyroscopic effect Asymmetric blade effect Gyroscopic Effect A rotating propeller has the properties of a gyroscope - rigidity in space and precession. The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Note: Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up. Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down.

BLADE ANGLE (PITCH) The angle between the blade chord and the plane of rotation. ANGLE OF ATTACK The path of the propeller through the air determines the direction of the relative airflow. The angle between the blade chord and the relative airflow is the angle of attack (α). The angle of attack (α) is the result of propeller rotational velocity (RPM) and aircraft forward velocity (TAS). Because the rotational velocity of the blade increases with distance from the propeller shaft and the fact that the aeroplane is moving forward, then the angle of attack of the blade varies at different distances from the shaft. CONSTANT SPEED PROPELLER The purpose of a variable-pitch propeller is to either manually or automatically maintain the optimum angle of attack to maximize the lift/drag ratio of the propeller as the aeroplane speed changes. Constant-speed propellers enable the pilot to select the RPM for maximum power or maximum efficiency and a propeller governor varies the propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected RPM. Figure shows the conditions during the early stages of the take-off roll. The RPM is set to maximum and the TAS is low. The angle of attack is optimum and maximum available efficiency is obtained. As the aircraft continues to accelerate, the TAS will increase, which decreases the angle of attack of the blades. Less thrust will be generated and less propeller torque. This gives less resistance for the engine to overcome and RPM would tend to increase. The propeller governor senses the RPM increase and increases pitch to maintain the blade angle of attack constant.",

            "explanation": "Asymmetric blade effect (also known as ‘P’ Factor) Propeller blades are not flat, they are in fact shaped the same as wings. As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently: An aircraft rarely flies at 0º Angle of Attack, and is always pitched slightly up from this. This means that the down-going blade will have a larger angle of attack compared to the up-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the down-going blade exerts a greater force than the up-going blade. For this reason, the thrust line will be displaced to one side of the propeller disc (the down-going section). Propellers both rotating clockwise (same direction): if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a thrust arm further from the centre of the aircraft. The failure of the left-hand engine will therefore result in a larger yaw effect (as the right hand engine produces power further away from the longitudinal axis). The left engine is therefore the critical engine, as its failure causes a worse power asymmetry. Counter-rotating propellers: Some aircraft are made so the engines rotate the opposite of each other - called counter-rotating. The most effective method is have them both rotate inwards (right engine anticlockwise, left engine clockwise), as the down-going blades are close to the centre of the aircraft, and there is less asymmetry after any engine failure. The question also mentions outwards rotating propellers. These would serve no added purpose, as the asymmetry would be high after either engine failure. Counter rotating propellers have no critical engine, as both failure scenarios produce equal asymmetry. Therefore, the correct option is: Failure of the right engine if both engines are counter rotating inwards, as this guarantees that the thrust vector will be as close to the centre of the aircraft as possible. Note: \"The failure of the left engine if both engines are rotating in the same direction\" is unknown, because it is correct if the engines are rotating anti-clockwise, but not when the engines are rotating clockwise. As we don't have that information, we can not say it is correct (and also, clockwise rotation is generally more common).",

The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Note: Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up. Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down.

As propellers are spinning blades, the tips are travelling much further than the roots during each rotation, but in the same amount of time. The propeller tips are therefore going much faster than the blade root, and this is all lateral speed (i.e. not forwards speed). The forwards speed of airflow into the propeller is the same for all sections of the blade, but the lateral speed of the propeller varies massively along the length of the blade. This means the angle of the oncoming airflow is very different for the propeller tip as for the root (near the hub). For this reason, the propeller blade is twisted very significantly between the root and the tip, in order to make sure that the angle of attack remains roughly constant along the length of the blade. The root of the propeller has a very large blade angle and the tip has a much smaller blade angle, but - at the optimum RPM and forwards speed (TAS) - the angle of attack of the whole propeller should be close to the optimum angle of attack. As for the other options: The thrust is not meant to be constant at all locations on the propeller, as there is no way to make the slow moving root produce the same amount of thrust as the fast moving tip, and also you don't want the tip to produce too much thrust as it could warp the blade. This one is a common misconception so be sure not to get it wrong. The blade angle is changed by twisting the blade, an un-twisted propeller would have constant blade angle (and very poor performance/efficiency). All sections of the propeller cannot all go at the same speed as this is physically impossible.",

In terms of thrust output, this is very low at the root due to the low rotational speed, but increases with rotational speed until around 75% of the blade length, which produces roughly the maximum thrust output.

As a consequence, as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, the air passing by hits the blades differently. It's way more common to study the effect of P factor from a perpective of a positive angle of attack (i.e. during take-off). However, in this case, we are confronted with a situation of negative angle of attack. In such case (negative angle of attack), the up-going blade will have a larger angle of attack compared to the down-going blade, generating more thrust. This then means that the up-swinging (left) blade exerts a greater force than the down-going blade. This difference in thrust will give a yawing moment to the right with a clockwise rotating propeller in a nose-up attitude.",

Propeller pitch is often referred to as ‘coarse’ for a greater horizontal blade angle and ‘fine’ for a more vertical angle. The thrust from a propeller depends on its speed and angle of attack. As the tip of the propeller has a higher speed than the hub, propellers ate often twisted along the blade to remain uniform thrust along the blade. In case of an engine failure, a propeller that is not generating thrust is only generating drag, which is not beneficial for flying. Thus, we want to reduce the drag from this propeller. A propeller that is catching a lot of air and therefore generating a lot of drag is called a windmilling propeller. We can use a technique called feathering to adjust the angle of attack of the propeller so that it meets the least amount of air, thus generating less drag.",

            "explanation": "A propeller blade is just a wing. Anything that happens to a propeller blade can be translated into our knowledge of how a wing behaves. The main difference is that the air interacting with a propeller blade is partially from ahead of the aircraft, brought in by the TAS (True Airspeed) of the aircraft, and the other component of the incoming air is from the rotational speed of the propeller. This means that the angle of relative airflow will change, depending on the RPM and TAS, and their relationship. In the case of this diagram, we have one force being created by the propeller blade, split into two components. Number 1 component is opposing the rotation of the propeller, where number 2 component is in the direction of flight. This makes number 2 quite simple, it is the thrust produced. It is quite a similar force vector to the lift created by a fixed wing. Number 1 is the opposing force of the propeller rotation, and therefore the opposing force to the engine. This means that it is the opposing torque, known sometimes just as \"torque\" or \"torque drag\". Torque is the measure of how much force an engine can apply in one rotation, and for an engine at constant RPM, the torque from the engine will match the \"torque drag\" of the propeller. Notice how, for a wing, number 1 would be closely related to the drag of the wing, hence even easier to remember \"torque drag\"",

Originally there were only two pitch settings, fine for take-off and climb and coarse for cruise and high-speed flight. Subsequently, the fully variable pitch constant-speed propeller was introduced so that the optimum blade angle of attack could be maintained over the whole range of operating speeds for that airplane. This facility not only improves the propeller efficiency but also decreases the fuel consumption. The pitch angle or blade angle of a constant-speed propeller (fixe RPM) increases (or coarsens) with increasing TAS. Constant-speed propellers enable the pilot to select the RPM for maximum power or maximum efficiency and a propeller governor varies the propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected RPM. Propeller efficiency improves with increased TAS; however, it is limited to that blade angle beyond which the propeller will no longer produce any thrust.",

To ensure its efficient operation the blade angle of attack of a fixed-pitch propeller must be close to the optimum and is that which produces the greatest excess of horizontal lift (thrust) over drag. A large blade angle or coarse pitch is suitable for high-speed flight (cruise). The geometric pitch is the distance the propeller would travel forward in one complete revolution if it were moving through the air at the blade angle. The higher the blade angle the higher the geometric pitch. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. In low forward speed flight, the angle of attack for is large. This produces a large amount of thrust but at the same time it creates a large amount of drag. To maintain a constant RPM, it is essential to overcome the drag and that requires a high propeller torque. The propeller efficiency in these circumstances is low. By increasing the speed, the helix angle increases. Although the angle of attack of is smaller and less thrust is produced the amount of drag induced is significantly less, this makes the propeller efficiency proportionately greater. It is this speed that attains the greatest propeller efficiency. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

To ensure its efficient operation the blade angle of attack of a fixed-pitch propeller must be close to the optimum and is that which produces the greatest excess of horizontal lift (thrust) over drag. A large blade angle or coarse pitch is suitable for high-speed flight (cruise). The geometric pitch is the distance the propeller would travel forward in one complete revolution if it were moving through the air at the blade angle. The higher the blade angle the higher the geometric pitch. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. In low forward speed flight, the angle of attack for is large. This produces a large amount of thrust but at the same time it creates a large amount of drag. To maintain a constant RPM, it is essential to overcome the drag and that requires a high propeller torque. The propeller efficiency in these circumstances is low. By increasing the speed, the helix angle increases. Although the angle of attack of is smaller and less thrust is produced the amount of drag induced is significantly less, this makes the propeller efficiency proportionately greater. It is this speed that attains the greatest propeller efficiency. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

Despite the engine failing the airplane still has forward speed, for a single-engine airplane due to the glide descent the forward speed causes the propeller to have a negative angle of attack due to the direction of the relative airflow. This angle of attack generates sufficient torque to rotate the unpowered propeller in the normal direction of rotation. The component of the force at right angles to the plane of rotation now acts rearwards and is no longer thrust but is now drag and presents a flat disc to the direction of travel. Because the propeller is being driven only by the relative airflow it is said to be wind milling. As such, it causes a considerable amount of drag, reduces the IAS, reduces the Lift/Drag ratio and increases the rate of descent.",

The propeller torque must thus be overcome or balanced by engine torque for a propeller section to provide thrust.

In so doing, it tends to twist the engine and airframe in the opposite direction to the propeller (i.e. counter- clockwise). This causes the aircraft to roll to the left and, whilst on the ground, places more weight on the left wheel than the right wheel. This effectively increases the rolling resistance (i.e. drag) of the left wheel, thus slowing the aircraft down and causing it to yaw to the left. GYROSCOPIC EFFECT Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc.",

Please send any further feedback about this question to us via the comments, the feedback area on the dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Propellers generate 4 main secondary effects on an aircraft: Torque effect Gyroscopic precession Slipstream Asymmetric blade effect For this question, we can go through each statement and check whether the effect is correct or not for the scenario. 1. TORQUE EFFECT The anti-clockwise rotating propeller gains more anti-clockwise rotational momentum when the pilot adds thrust (higher RPM), so the aircraft experiences the opposite (clockwise) rotation, and is rolled to the right (this can be corrected using left aileron). Statement 1 is correct. 2. GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause an forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the right of the propeller disc. This creates a yaw to the left. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. 3. SLIPSTREAM The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling anti-clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the right hand side, causing a tail-left, nose-right moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the right. Statement 3 is correct. 4. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, so the thrust line of this anti-clockwise propeller is to the left of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (left of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the right. Statement 4 is correct.",

In the context of a rotating propeller, this reaction occurs 90° in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. Consequently, when an aircraft undergoes pitching or yawing movements, forces act upon the spinning propeller disc, leading to distinct reactions. For instance, in an aircraft equipped with a clockwise rotating propeller, pitching the nose up applies a forward force to the bottom of the propeller disc. This force triggers a reaction 90° ahead in the rotation direction, resulting in a right yawing moment. The effects are as follows: Pitching down applies a forward force to the upper part of the disc, resulting in a force effect 90° clockwise and a left yaw. Yawing to the left applies a forward force to the right side, generating a force effect 90° clockwise and a pitch upward. Yawing to the right applies a forward force to the left side, producing a force effect 90° clockwise and a pitch downward.",

Please send any further feedback about this question to us via the comments, the feedback area on the dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Propellers generate 4 main secondary effects on an aircraft: Torque effect Gyroscopic precession Slipstream Asymmetric blade effect For this question, we can go through each statement and check whether the effect is correct or not for the scenario. TORQUE EFFECT - Option D The anti-clockwise rotating propeller gains more anti-clockwise rotational momentum when the pilot adds thrust (higher RPM), so the aircraft experiences the opposite (clockwise) rotation, and is rolled to the right (this can be corrected using left aileron). Option D is therefore incorrect. GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION - Option A The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause an forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the right of the propeller disc. This creates a yaw to the left. Option A is therefore incorrect. SLIPSTREAM EFFECT - Option C The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling anti-clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the right hand side, causing a tail-left, nose-right moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the right. Option C is therefore incorrect. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT - Option B The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, so the thrust line of this anti-clockwise propeller is to the left of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (left of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the right. Option B is correct.",

The main causes of this are: Slipstream effect Torque reaction Gyroscopic effect Asymmetric blade effect Gyroscopic Effect A rotating propeller has the properties of a gyroscope - rigidity in space and precession. The characteristic which produces “gyroscopic effect” is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the reaction that occurs when a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc. When a force is applied to the rim of a propeller, the reaction occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation and in the same direction as the applied force. As the aircraft is pitched up or down or yawed left or right, a force is applied to the rim of the spinning propeller disc. Gyroscopic effect only occurs when the aircraft pitches and/or yaws. The Gyroscopic Effect is more significant in situations of high power (RPM) and low forward speed, such as take-off or low speed climbs. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. For a clockwise rotating propeller: Pitch up - forward force on the bottom, force emerges 90° clockwise, right yaw. Right yaw - forward force on the left, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch down. Pitch down - forward force on the top, force emerges 90° clockwise, left yaw. Left yaw - forward force on the right, force emerges 90° clockwise, pitch up.",

This angle of attack generates sufficient torque to rotate the unpowered propeller in the normal direction of rotation. The component of the force at right angles to the plane of rotation now acts rearwards and is no longer thrust but is now drag and presents a flat disc to the direction of travel. Because the propeller is being driven only by the relative airflow it is said to be wind milling. As such, it causes a considerable amount of drag, reduces the IAS, reduces the Lift/Drag ratio and increases the rate of descent.",

            "explanation": "The two aerodynamic forces acting on a propeller are similar to that of a wing, which has lift (what we want) and drag (what we don't want). For a propeller though, these forces become Thrust (what we want) and Torque (what we don't want). This torque is specifically propeller torque, which pushes back against the rotation of the engine, and thereby opposes engine torque. In normal operations, as in the first image above, the propeller torque is acting against the direction of rotation, so in this case, anti-clockwise. However, if the engine is windmilling, (second image) then there is no engine torque to rotate the propeller (usually because it has failed), however, the windmill effect means that the incoming airflow actually pushes the propeller the correct way round, which is clockwise in this case, and also produces a lot of negative thrust (drag). The aerodynamic propeller torque is therefore with the direction of rotation (clockwise), as it is the driving force, and strangely the engine drag is the opposing force (anti-clockwise) in this case. Therefore, the windmilling propeller torque direction is clockwise. Reverse thrust (negative pitch) operations are a whole other scenario (third image above). Often called the \"beta range\", this is where the propeller pitch is sent past the fine pitch stop and the angle of attack becomes very negative. The engine is still running the propeller at this point, often at high RPMs, as this negative angle of attack produces a lot of reverse thrust. The driving torque is still provided by the engine in this case though, and the propeller (aerodynamic) torque is opposing the direction of rotation, so even though the thrust produced is negative, the torques are still the same as normal operation. In this case, the propeller torque is anti-clockwise. Remember that a propeller is designed never to turn the wrong direction. If it is a clockwise rotating propeller, it will always want to turn clockwise. No scenario other than hand pulling will make it turn anticlockwise.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is similar to question 812009 but seen with more of a story in the question. Let's start by considering the roll of the aircraft, it is mainly just affected by the torque effect. TORQUE EFFECT This occurs primarily because the air resists the motion of the propeller. In so doing, it tends to twist the engine and airframe in the opposite direction to the propeller (i.e. anti-clockwise). This causes the aircraft to roll to the left and is particularly noticeable in a go-around scenario, where the airspeed over the ailerons is low, and maximum power is applied, not only causing a large increase in torque effect but also the rotational acceleration of the propeller provides a further effect. So that's why the aircraft will roll to the left in this scenario. But the yaw is, unfortunately, a little more complicated as there are a few extra factors at play, in fact almost all the secondary effects are here. The asymmetric blade effect (P-factor) will cause a yaw to the left; The gyroscopic precession causes a smaller, temporary yaw to the right whilst pitching up; The slipstream effect causes an increased yaw to the left; and Therefore, overall the aircraft yaws to the left, hence the need for more right rudder than you expect if you've trained in an aircraft with a clockwise rotating propeller, which is highly likely. SLIPSTREAM The spinning of the propeller affects the air that it pushes backwards, and imparts a spiral onto that air, in this case spiralling clockwise around the aircraft, hitting the tail fin on the left hand side, causing a tail-right, nose-left moment. The slipstream increases with an increase in thrust, causing a yaw to the left. GYROSCOPIC PRECESSION The propeller is a mass, spinning at high speed, and therefore acts as a gyroscope. That means that any rotation of the aircraft in pitch or yaw will gain a different force from the propeller due to gyroscopic precession. The force from the propeller will be rotated by 90º in the direction of rotation. In this case, the pitch-up will cause a forward force on the bottom of the propeller disc, which is rotated by precession to a forwards force on the left of the propeller disc, which is a transient yaw to the right. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT The asymmetric blade effect comes from the aircraft being at an angle of attack to the air, so the air does not flow perpendicular to the propeller disc. The down-going propeller blades always produce more thrust than the up-going blades, due to a higher angle of attack, so the thrust line of this clockwise propeller is to the right of centre. An increase in thrust will therefore cause a larger force through this location (right of centre), which yaws the aircraft to the left.",

            "explanation": "The critical engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing propeller-driven aircraft is the one whose failure would result in the most adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance. When one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust asymmetry exists. The thrust asymmetry can be different, depending on how the engine is mounted. Particularly on a propeller aircraft, the propellers are subject to the asymmetric blade effect, called P-factor. This occurs because the propeller does not spin perpendicular to the airflow, as the aircraft is flying with an angle of attack. This means that the down-going blades on the propeller have a higher angle of attack and longer track, so they produce more thrust. Therefore, the thrust vector of the engine is located not centrally, but more towards the down-going blade side. This means that one engine has its thrust vector further from the aircraft's longitudinal axis, and therefore if the other engine fails, it has a worse effect on yaw. This engine (with the worst effect on yaw) is called the critical engine. As the propellers on the pilot's new aircraft rotate anticlockwise (when viewed from behind), the down-going blades are on the left hand side, so the thrust lines of the engines are to the left of the engine. Therefore, losing the right hand engine would leave the pilot with the remaining thrust line furthest from the cockpit. The right hand engine is therefore the critical engine. Note that the figure shown above is the opposite, it is for an aircraft with clockwise rotating engines, as most do.",

The reduction in torque occurs through the configuration, for instance, when the propellers rotate inwards, with the left engine turning clockwise and the right engine turning anti-clockwise. In this setup, the torque effect generated by each engine is in the opposite direction, theoretically equal in magnitude. Consequently, the theoretical result is a reduction of the torque effect to zero. Further information: Most traditional twin-engine aircraft have clockwise-rotating propellers when viewed from behind. When equipped with co-rotating propellers (both rotating clockwise) on a small twin, there is minimal torque reaction around the airplane's center of gravity until one engine fails. A left turning tendency would then occur. In contrast, small twins with counter-rotating propellers can reduce torque reaction after an engine failure. In this configuration, the propeller on the left-hand engine (Engine nr.1) rotates clockwise, while the one on the right-hand engine (Engine nr.2) rotates counter-clockwise. The primary advantage lies in balancing torque and P-factor effects, ensuring there is no critical engine in the event of failure. The critical engine, in the context of a multi-engine airplane, refers to the engine whose failure would result in the most adverse impact on performance and handling abilities.",

The counteracting forces generated by the aerodynamic control surfaces are proportional to the square of the airspeed (V2), to the area of the control surfaces (S) and to the air density. For a given size of the vertical tail with rudder, there is a speed below which the generated rudder side force is not large enough to counteract the asymmetrical thrust, or below which the ailerons are not effective anymore: the heading and/or bank angle cannot be maintained below this speed. This speed is called Minimum Control speed in the Air VMCA. With regards to this question, Cold air is more dense. Engines are able to produce more power in colder weather due to being able to achieve higher mass flow with the higher density air. As power increases, the operative engine requires more rudder authority to maintain directional stability due to the increase in thrust. As a result, the airplane requires higher indicated airspeeds to maintain directional stability. Therefore, VMCA increases.",

As they are only going to end up holding anyway, they might as well save some fuel in the cruise, and have to do less holding patterns later on. This is assuming that they have already \"joined the queue\" at their destination airport, which is implied in the question. The best endurance speed in a jet aircraft is the speed at which the engines need to produce the least thrust, as thrust is directly proportional to fuel flow, and we want to make our fuel flow the lowest it can be. The speed of minimum thrust required is the speed of least drag (as thrust directly opposed drag). We called this VMD, for minimum drag speed, and it is the speed that aircraft fly in the holding pattern, and when it is time in the air that is most desirable, rather than distance gone. It occurs at the bottom of the \"total drag\" curve as shown in the annex above, where the combination of induced and parasite drag equals the lowest value. There is no point climbing up to the optimum altitude at this stage, as it is not an efficient use of fuel to climb just before descent. Also, that option is not correct because we do not care about maximum range now, only maximum endurance.",

In order to maintain directional control and keeping the aircraft in equilibrium around the yaw axis, the pilot must apply corrective action. Above a certain speed this will be possible using aerodynamic controls only. If the aircraft is still on the ground this means the use of the rudder, if the aircraft is airborne, the pilot can also apply bank by using the ailerons. The greater the thrust of this operating engine(s), the greater the yawing moment will be and the greater the aerodynamic forces to counteract this yawing moment would be required. VMCA = Minimum control speed in the take-off configuration with gear up – the minimum calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control and maintain straight flight using no more than 5° of bank without required exceptional piloting skill or the aeroplane adopting a dangerous attitude or changing heading by more than 20°. An increased bank angle beyond 5°, while keeping the rudder centered, may lead to a fin stall, due to an extreme sideslip angle, but when decreasing the bank angle below 5° to 0°, rudder deflection has to be increased and therefore VMCA will increase, too. Equilibrium of moments about the normal axis (also called yaw or vertical axis) is provided by rudder deflection (yaw) Equilibrium of moments about the lateral axis is provided by elevator deflection (pitch) Equilibrium of moments about the longitudinal axis is provided by aileron deflection (roll) Note: Forces along the lateral axis is not the same like moments around the lateral axis. Forces along the lateral axis act around the longitudinal axis. Therefore an equilibrium along the lateral axis always requires bank or sideslip.",

The inclusion of \"propeller aircraft\" in the question is unclear, some feedback indicates this may be present, some does not. The question appears to be much easier to answer with it present, though the same answer remains correct even if it is not (though the effect is less pronounced on jet aircraft). If a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure when airborne, there are two immediate aerodynamic effects: The initial effect is the yawing that occurs due to the asymmetry of the thrust line. The second effect is roll. This occurs when the aircraft continues to yaw towards the failed engine resulting in a decrease in lift from the retreating wing and a yaw-induced roll towards the failed engine. In this case, when experiencing a left engine failure, the aircraft will bank towards the left. This roll will be more marked if the flaps are extended, as the right wing will create significantly greater lift. This occurs simply due to the secondary effect of the yawing moment anyway, but the effect of flaps on an engine-failure-induced roll is worse for a propeller aircraft as the slipstream induced lift is a greater proportion of the total lift when flaps are extended, so losing this is a greater roll moment when flaps are extended than when the wing is clean. The flaps also increase drag quite significantly, and this can make it difficult or impossible for some less powerful twin-prop aircraft to climb single engine in the event of a go-around. Often it is best for them to accelerate and retract flaps first, then begin a climb with a clean configuration.",

If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG. The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. RUDDER MOMENT The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force). Note: In this exercise, the left engine failed, which means that initially the yawing moment would be to the left, causing the nose to point to the left. If after the nose is to the right, it means that the pilot might have made a too big rudder input and the nose is now to the right, creating a sideslip. This is why it is important to know what factors influence the rudder moment, one of which is that an increase in rudder input increases its angle of attack, which increases the overall force that the rudder produces.",

Airworthiness Authorities, in this case the EASA, have laid down conditions which must be satisfied when establishing the minimum airspeeds for inclusion in the Flight Manual of a new aircraft type. As in most other cases, the conditions under which the minimum control airspeeds are established are ‘worst case’. VMCA is affected by the amount of thrust being developed by the operating engine. As altitude and/or temperature increases, the thrust from an unsupercharged engine will decrease. In conditions of high air density, the engines produce a high thrust output and the loss of the output from one engine during take-off is a proportionate loss of a high output. This will require a considerable amount of force to counteract the tendency to yaw. Air density will be highest when the aerodrome pressure altitude is lowest (high atmospheric pressure), the air temperature is lowest and the water-vapour content of the air is lowest.",

We are requesting that you let us know if you see this in your exam, as anything you remember from it could be useful for us to improve this question, thank you. We believe the examiner is simply asking \"which of these angles of attack on the fin is worst if your engine has already failed.\" When an engine fails, if correctly handled (wings level technique), the aircraft should enter a sideslip condition, where the aircraft is pointing forwards but actually travelling slightly in the direction of the failed engine, therefore the airflow is coming from the failed engine side, and hitting the vertical stabiliser (fin) and rudder from that side. The greater the sideslip angle, the harder the aircraft is to control. Therefore, we reach the conclusion that an \"Increased angle of attack on the inoperative engine's side\" is worst here. As you can see from the 2 figures above put together, the sideslip caused by the left engine failing means the air over the fin is from the left side, and any increase in this sideslip angle makes the aircraft more difficult to handle, so is worse.",

For an aircraft to continue in the same direction at the same speed, the forces on it must be balanced. In straight and level flight, thrust equals drag and lift equals weight, as 2 opposing pairs. When the thrust is lower than the drag, as in this case, the aircraft will start to decelerate. However, in order to remain at the same speed, the pilot can allow a descent to begin. As the aircraft descends, a component of the weight force which alwas points directly down is now pointing in the same direction as the thrust force, and is acting as \"thrust\" to push the aircraft forwards. The amount of \"thrust\" provided by the aircraft's weight plus any thrust from the engines should equal the drag on the aircraft in the descent, and the aircraft will maintain a constant speed, and lose altitude. This is shown by the following equation D = T + W sinγ Where D, T and W are Drag, Thrust and Weight. γ = descent angle This can be re-arranged for us to work out the descent angle, γ. The units are all the same and therefore cancel each other out, though feel free to expand out the units in your calculation (125 kN = 125 000 N, etc.): sin γ = (D - T) / W sin γ = (130 - 50) / 1500 sin γ = 0.05333. γ = sin-1 0.05333. γ = 3.06° Therefore the angle of descent is closest to 3°.",

The pallet of freight being placed in the forward hold, instead of where it was supposed to be placed (the aft hold) means that the aircraft's CG is actually further forward than the pilots are aware of. The location of an aircraft's CG is an important factor for many things, both for stability and control as well as for the aircraft's performance. When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce. For every bit of lift the wing produces though, there is some induced drag that occurs, which means that further forward CG locations cause higher drag, and therefore lower climb performance, shorter aircraft range, and generally worse efficiency. It is possible that the forward CG would have an effect on yaw, due to the slightly longer moment arm of the fin and rudder, but the effect would be incredibly small, particularly when compared to the other effects it causes.",

RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given bank angle is directly proportional to the square of the airspeed. Which means that doubling the airspeed results in a radius of turn that is four times greater RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

A coordinated turn is one in which the only acceleration is along the normal axis of the airplane, towards the center of the turn, and the angle of bank is precisely correct for the aircraft speed and the radius of turn. If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, turn radius and rate of turn are defined as: Turn radius=TAS 2/g tan Φ Rate of Turn=g tan Φ/TAS Therefore, turn radius is directly proportional to TAS squared and inversely proportional to bank angle and Rate of Turn is directly proportional to bank angle and inversely proportional to TAS. In this exercise, TAS is equal to 530 knots and the bank angle is 15°: First, convert 530kt to m/s: 530kt x 0.5144 = 272.63m/s Then, calculate the turn radius Turn radius = 272.63 2/10 ∗ tan 15 Turn radius ≈ 27739.66m The circumference is given by: c = 2 x π x r c = 2 x π x 27739.66 c = 174293.45m At 272.63 m/s, it would take approximately 640 seconds to complete the circumference.",

            "explanation": "In level flight, any turn will be coordinated or uncoordinated. A coordinated turn is one in which the only acceleration is along the normal axis of the airplane, towards the center of the turn, and the angle of bank is precisely correct for the aircraft speed and the radius of turn. If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, turn radius and rate of turn are defined as: Turn radius = TAS 2/g tanΦ Rate of Turn = g tan Φ/TAS Therefore, turn radius is directly proportional to TAS squared and inversely proportional to bank angle and Rate of Turn is directly proportional to bank angle and inversely proportional to TAS. In this exercise, TAS is equal to 300 knots and the bank angle is 45°: First, convert 300 kt to m/s: 300 kt * 0.5144 = 154.32 m/s Finally, calculate the turn radius Turn radius = 154.32 2/10 ∗ tan 45 Turn radius ≈ 2380 m",

With regards to this question, When the bank angle is decreased from 5 degrees to 0 degrees, the value of VMCA will remain approximately constant. INCORRECT When an engine failure occurs during level flight, in order to maintain wings level, a lot of rudder input is necessary. An increase in bank (usually around 2-5º bank angle), reduces the required rudder input, which provides more controllability, decreasing VMCA. But when decreasing the bank angle below 5º (to 0º), rudder deflection has to be increases and, therefore, VMCA will increase too. VMCA is certified with a bank angle of not more than 5º towards the operating engine, because a lower figure can be obtained compared with wings level. When the bank angle is increased beyond 5 degrees, there is an increasing risk of fin stall. CORRECT An increased bank angle beyond 5º, while keeping the rudder centred, may lead us to encounter a new dangerous situation – sideslip towards the live engine, which could possibly send the fin’s angle of attack beyond critical alpha, leading to a fin stall. Control of the aircraft will be immediately lost.",

There are three variables in a glide descent, the IAS, the configuration and the glide angle that can be manipulated to achieve either of two goals, maximum range or maximum endurance. Glide for maximum range The use of flap is restricted to the period of the descent when the IAS has fallen below the maximum speed for lowering flap (VLO). It is, therefore, limited to the final approach path. Using flap increases parasite drag, decreases the Lift/Drag ratio, increases the effective angle of attack and decreases the maximum glide range. Increased flap decreases range because of the increased pitch angle Glide for maximum endurance The speed used during the descent is the rate of movement of the aeroplane along the descent path and is divided into two components: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal component is the aeroplane’s forward movement across the ground, its groundspeed, and the vertical component is its rate of descent. It is essential to reduce the vertical component to a minimum to produce the maximum endurance. The power required is the product of the TAS and the drag. Therefore, the lowest rate of descent is attained at the speed for which the least power is required. Increased flap decreases endurance because of the increased drag. To complete this exercise we are looking for the descent path which displays both a decrease in range and endurance. That is path number 4.",

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cos γ T = D + W sin γ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T/W)−(D/L) From the exercise, the climb gradient is 20%: sin γ = 0.2 We can find the climb angle by applying: γ= sin-1 0.2 ≈11.54° Knowing that: L = Wcos γ ⇒ L/W = cos γ = n The load factor is: n = cos11.54° ≈ 0.98",

            "explanation": "Flaps are very useful on aircraft for decreasing the stall speed, allowing aircraft to safely land and take-off at much lower speeds than they would with a clean wing. This has numerous benefits, including the shortening of runways. Flaps have very limited uses in flight, though, and there is a good reason why pilots are so hasty to get rid of them after take-off. Flaps increase the drag of a wing, reducing climb rates and increasing fuel burn. The use of flaps in a glide descent increases the drag for no real increase in lift (flaps can increase lift, but the aircraft has not got any heavier, so does not need it), and therefore drastically reduce the L/D ratio (Lift to Drag ratio). The L/D ratio is what decides the glide angle, and is highest in a clean configuration. Flaps cause a steeper glide angle, decreasing the possible glide distance. This extra drag also leads to a greater rate of descent, meaning that the aircraft will have less glide endurance, and the glide time is therefore decreased. If the question mentioned that the pilot slowed down due to extending flaps, then it is possible that the glide time could remain the same or increase, as the lower airspeed means that, even at a steeper glide angle, the aircraft might have a similar or possibly lower rate of descent. As no mention was made of this in the question, and none of the options allow it anyway, we will discount it, but please be aware that it could be asked in such a way, and that may be the correct answer. No matter what the question though.",

They tell us this in the question, perhaps because we are not expected to know that in the PoF exam. In the climb, this may not be noticeable for a while, and might not be noticed at all if the autopilot was in certain modes, such as those which maintain a constant rate of climb (assuming constant thrust). Whatever happens, as the aircraft continues to climb, the actual airspeed is unknown whilst the indicated airspeed (IAS) is showing a continuous increase. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

            "explanation": "The polar diagram of CL vs CD is a very common one to be used in the exams. It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. We can therefore imagine what each of the options would do to the graph, and measure that up with the annex in the question. \"Lift dumpers\" Lift dumpers such as wing spoilers reduce lift (as per their name) by ruining the airflow over the wing, and increase drag through this very same method, and by putting an obstruction in the airflow. They would cause the graph to go down and to the right. \"Landing Gear\" Landing Gear won't affect our lift, but they will increase drag, so the graph will move to the right only, not downwards like we see in the annex. \"Trailing Edge Flaps\" Flaps increase our CLMAX and also increase drag, so the graph would move up and to the right, which is exactly what is shown in the annex, so this is correct. \"Speedbrakes\" Aircraft speedbrakes are effectively the same thing as lift dumpers, but often used at lower angles to increase drag whilst avoiding a complete destruction of the lift over the wing. The graph would move down and to the right.",

Primarily there will be a yawing moment towards the failed (dead) engine. The critical engine is the engine which would give the biggest yawing moment if it fails. One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following an engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (i.e., distance from the aircraft's CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). In case of a propeller engine aircraft, the length of the thrust arm is determined by the asymmetric effect of the propeller. When the aircraft is flying with a positive angle of attack (which is normal), the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller (when viewed from the rear) is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade (P-factor). If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a larger yawing moment. If both engines rotate inward, they will have the same (shorter) thrust arm (counter-rotating propellers). Of course, no matter the direction of the propellers, a failure of the left engine will always produce a yaw to the left, it is just bigger if the aircraft has clockwise rotation propellers.",

            ],
            "explanation": "ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT ('p factor') In general, the propeller shaft will be inclined upwards from the direction of flight due to the angle of attack of the aircraft. This gives the down-going propeller blade a greater effective angle of attack than the up-going blade. When viewed from behind if the propeller rotation is clockwise the right side of the disc produces more thrust than the left side and this imbalance of thrust will cause the aeroplane to yaw to the left and vice versa if rotation is anticlockwise. A similar imbalance of thrust is produced between the top and bottom of the propeller disc if the aeroplane is yawed in level flight. This is because the upper and lower blades will have different angles of attack and as a result will cause the nose of the aeroplane to pitch-up or down depending on the direction of rotation and the direction of the yaw. When viewed from behind if the propeller is rotating clockwise and the yaw is to the left then the lower blade has the greatest angle of attack and produces more lift which causes the nose to pitch up. If the yaw is to the right the nose will pitch-down. The asymmetric-blade effect increases when the angle between the propeller axis and the airflow through the disc increases or if the engine power increases. CRITICAL ENGINE One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (distance from the CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment; a higher IAS (VMC) would be necessary to maintain directional control. So at a given IAS, the situation would be more critical if the left engine failed. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. During a crosswind take-off an airplane tends to weathercock into wind. Because of this the failure of the outboard engine on the windward side of the airplane is the most difficult to counteract.",

The rudder control forces may not exceed 150 pounds (68.1 kg) and, until the aeroplane becomes airborne, the lateral control may only be used to the extent of keeping the wings level. In the determination of VMCG, assuming that the path of the aeroplane accelerating with all engines operating is along the centre of the runway, its path from the point at which the critical engine is made inoperative to the point at which recovery to a direction parallel to the centre line is completed may not deviate more than 30 ft (9.144 m) laterally from the centre line at any point. As with VMCA, this must be established with: maximum available take-off power or thrust on the engines. the aeroplane trimmed for take-off. the most unfavourable CG position. maximum sea level take-off weight. Because the aircraft rotates around the CG, the position of the CG directly affects the length of the rudder arm and, thus, the power of the rudder and fin to maintain directional stability and control. The ‘worst case’ is with the CG at the aft limit. If the requirements can be met in this configuration, the ability to maintain directional control will be enhanced at any other CG location. A more forward CG decreases VMCG.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds",

We believe that the engine failed drag curve should be tilted slightly to show how induced drag remains the same but parasite drag increases with an engine failure. Nonetheless, there is still only one answer that is correct here, so until we receive further feedback, we will keep the figure as it is. In the climb, if one of the engines is lost, then the thrust available is now reduced by half and drag is increased due to a stopped or windmilling propeller/engine. This significantly reduces the excess performance of the aircraft, meaning that the rate of climb will be much lower, and the aircraft will not be able to climb to as high of an altitude. At high altitudes, this makes the aircraft unable to reach equilibrium forces, and the pilots have to descend in order to maintain airspeed., and in some light piston twins, requires very precise flying to climb at all. On the graphs, when an engine failure occurs, the drag curve (the curve at the bottom) will get higher whilst the thrust available (the straight line for a jet aircraft) gets lower. As those lines get closer together, the aircraft has less excess performance and a much smaller operating speed range. Not only do you have to identify which curve is which on the graphs, but you also have to know what changes will happen to each in the event of an engine failure.",

All units are in metric. Radius (m), TAS (m/s), g (m/s2).

Banking the aircraft inclines the lift - it is the horizontal component of lift which causes the aircraft to turn. If the aircraft is banked and the angle of attack kept constant, the vertical component of lift will be too small to balance the weight and the aircraft will start to descend. As the angle of bank increases, the angle of attack must be increased to bring about a greater total lift. The vertical component must be large enough to maintain level flight, while the horizontal component is large enough to produce the required centripetal force. EFFECT OF WEIGHT ON TURNING In a steady level turn, if thrust is ignored, lift provides a force to balance weight and centripetal force to turn the aircraft. If the same TAS and angle of bank can be obtained, the radius of turn is basically independent of weight or the aircraft type. Not all aircraft can reach the same angle of bank at the same TAS. If weight increases, the vertical component of lift required increases, but the centripetal force to maintain the same radius of turn also increases in the same proportion. The lift required, although it is greater, has the same inclination to the vertical as before and the bank angle is the same.",

A higher CAS or IAS gives more flight control effectiveness, e.g., a larger available rudder moment to balance the yawing moment from a failed engine. A lower IAS will reduce the available rudder moment if the other parameters remain the same. Many operational speeds are based on the 1g stall speed. Low weights will result in a low 1g stall speed and low operational speeds. If the rudder is deflected at relative low speeds, the generated aerodynamic resultant will be smaller. At a certain low speed, the rudder may not be capable of generating the required force and moment, which results in a controllability problem.

More thrust means a greater yawing moment which requires a greater counterbalancing moment from the fin. Greater fin force requires a higher speed to generate it. Consequently, your calculated minimum control speeds are faster in cold, low altitude conditions (higher air density). In simple words, VMCG is established as being the lowest speed at which rudder effect alone is sufficient to regain and maintain directional control after a sudden engine failure. The major factor that affects VMCG is the difference in engine thrust. VMCG will therefore be lower at higher airport elevations and at a higher OAT (lower air density), due to the associated lower thrust. Conversely, VMCG will be higher at lower airport elevations and at a lower OAT (higher air density). If conditions are hot, high and humid the air is less dense. This reduces thrust and, consequently, when you lose the critical engine on take-off, there is less yawing effect from asymmetric thrust than there would be in denser air.",

This will oppose the yaw-left moment. If a left engine fails, the right side will produce more thrust than the left side, resulting in a left-yaw. This will add to the left-yaw moments.

A safety factor is included into these speeds to allow for aircraft aging and average pilot reaction time. VMC is affected by the amount of thrust being developed by the operating engine (thrust moment). As altitude and/or temperature increases, the power from an atmospheric (not supercharged) piston engine or thrust from a jet engine will decrease. Therefore, VMC decreases with an increase in altitude and/or temperature. Lower density (lower pressure/higher temperature) gives a higher density altitude.

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cos γ T = D + W sin γ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = T/W−D/L In this exercise, Weight is equal to 500000 N (W = m x g = 50000 x 10), D/L ratio is equal to 1/12 and Thrust equal to 20000 N per engine. For the all engines (four) climb gradient and applying the formula defined above: sin γ = (80000/500000)−(1/12) sinγ = 0.077 ⇒ sinγ = 7.7% The climb gradient is 7.7%.",

The vital action when an engine fails is to stop the yaw. Rudder is used to prevent yaw, and the wings are maintained level with aileron. Yawing towards the live engine gives a sideslip force on the keel surfaces opposite to the rudder force. If the sideslip angle is too large, the fin could stall. It is more aerodynamically efficient to balance the rudder side force by banking towards the live engine, so that lift gives a sideways component opposite to the rudder force.

Long Range Cruise (LRC) speed is the speed above the maximum-range cruise (MRC) speed which provides 99 percent of the absolute maximum specific range. The advantage is that 1 percent of range is traded for 3 to 5 percent higher cruise velocity. Point A: is between VMD and the maximum speed and has the minimum drag coefficient. It therefore approximates VY for a jet airplane. Point B: is the point at which a tangent from the origin touches the polar curve, which is at the point at which the total drag is minimum, the lift/drag ratio is maximum and the IAS in level flight is VMD. This is also the speed at which the longest glide distance will be achieved. Point C: falls between VMD and VS and is approximately VMP, which approximates to the speed of VY for a piston/propeller airplane and indicates the value at which the minimum sink rate will occur.

The rudder forces required to maintain control at VMCA may not exceed 150 lb. nor may it be necessary to reduce power or thrust on the operative engines. Note: There is no performance requirement, just directional control. Banking towards the live engine reduces the rudder deflection required and so allows a lower VMCA. The magnitude of VMCA increases with increased bank angle from 0° to 5°. The maximum limit is set at 5° because there is an increasing risk of fin stall above this limit. VMCA is affected by the amount of thrust being developed by the operating engine. As altitude and/or temperature increases, the thrust from an unsupercharged engine will decrease.

Wind component has no effect on the rate of climb. It can be expressed by: Rate of climb = Angle of climb x TAS The magnitude of the rate of climb is determined by the excess power available over that required. The value of the rate of climb is diminished by high altitude, high temperature, high mass and high flap setting either individually or in any combination. Any acceleration or a turn made whilst climbing also reduces the rate of climb. Because power is the rate of doing work then when dealing with a rate of climb the power curves must be used. To attain the maximum rate of climb the aircraft must be flown at the speed attained, at the point on the graph, at which the excess power available over that required is greatest. Rate of Climb = (T x TAS) – (D x TAS) / W So, Rate of Climb = (Power Available – Power Required) / W ALTITUDE vs. POWER REQUIRED Power required is drag times TAS. Although the total drag curve as a CAS does not move as altitude increases, it moves to the right if drawn against TAS. This is because for the same CAS, the TAS increases as the air density reduces. Figure 2 plots power available and power required against TAS and shows us that as altitude increases: - The excess power and rate of climb reduce - VY (TAS) increases to a slightly faster speed VARIATION OF THRUST WITH ALTITUDE As altitude increases, thrust available reduces because the air density and, therefore, mass flow reduce. In an effort to keep rate of climb constant, while climbing with a fixed thrust setting, the aircraft will be forced to climb at a slower speed given that Thrust Available to overcome Drag reduces with altitude.",

YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG. The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. ASYMMETRIC BLADE EFFECT If both engines rotate clockwise (figure 2), the right engine has a longer thrust arm. Failure of the left engine will give a larger yawing moment. This effect will be absent on an aircraft with counter-rotating propellers, contra-rotating propellers or jet engines. RUDDER MOMENT The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force).",

As with VMCA, this must be established with: maximum available take-off power or thrust on the engines. the airplane trimmed for take-off. the most unfavorable CG position. maximum sea level take-off weight. Because the aircraft rotates around the CG, the position of the CG directly affects the length of the rudder arm and, thus, the power of the rudder and fin to maintain directional stability and control.

The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable.

At a preliminary stage, the ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). CG position (affecting rudder arm). the IAS (affecting rudder force). The aircraft rotates about the CG. The fore and aft CG location has no effect on the yawing moment from a failed engine, but will influence the rudder arm, hence the rudder moment. If the airplane has an aft CG at the time of engine failure, the effective moment arm of the rudder is reduced, since all yawing movements take place about the CG. CG on the aft limit will give the smallest rudder arm and the least ability to oppose the yawing moment from a failed engine.",

To think of it another way, the weight is being counteracted by a component of the lift, and a component of the drag, which is now acting a little upwards also. Because the drag is now assisting lift, there is less lift required than in level flight. There are two usual equations that can be made from this graph. The first is all about the forwards/backwards forces on the aircraft: Drag = Thrust + [Weight x sin(Descent Angle)] The second equation is all about up/down forces on the aircraft: Lift = Weight x cos(Descent Angle) This second equation is the one that this question asks about. As the descent angle increases (the descent gets steeper), cos(Decent Angle) decreases, so Lift decreases. Weight has not changed, but the Lift has decreased (as drag is acting upwards against the weight), so the difference between the two increases. Also, this means that load factor (Lift/Weight) decreases in a descent and climb too. The second equation can be used in the descent or the climb.",

A coordinated turn is one in which the only acceleration is along the normal axis of the airplane, towards the center of the turn, and the angle of bank is precisely correct for the aircraft speed and the radius of turn. If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, the load factor (n) is defined by: n = L/W = 1/cos Φ On a 60° bank turn, to maintain the same lift as in straight and level flight, with a weight of 20000 N, L/20000 = 1/cos 60 L = 20000 * 1/cos⁡ 60 L = 40000 N Lift is equal to 40000 N.",

The conditions of equilibrium can be expressed in the form: L cos φ = W L = W / cos φ Where (L) is the wing lift in newtons, (W) is the weight of the aircraft in newtons and φ the angle of bank. TIP: Remember that in a turn, lift will be greater than the weight to remain at the same altitude. The cosine of any angle other than 0º is less than 1 => for L to be greater than W, the equation must be L cos φ = W (any bank angle requires a larger lift to balance the same weight). Due to the bank angle (φ) of the aircraft, the lift vector is tilted, therefore only a component of lift counteracts weight. But since level flight must be maintained, the component of lift has to be equal to weight. Consequently, lift must be increased. Centripetal force is the force generated towards the centre of turn and its magnitude depends on the radius of the turn and speed. Centripetal force is generated by additional lift. Note: Centrifugal force is the reaction to the centripetal force generated by the extra lift and acts towards the outside of the turn.",

The rudder forces required to maintain control at VMCA may not exceed 150 lb. nor may it be necessary to reduce power or thrust on the operative engines. Note: There is no performance requirement, just directional control. Banking towards the live engine reduces the rudder deflection required and so allows a lower VMCA. The maximum limit is set at 5° because there is an increasing risk of fin stall above this limit. Because the aircraft rotates around the CG, the position of the CG directly affects the length of the rudder arm and, thus, the power of the rudder and fin to maintain directional stability and control. The ‘worst case’ is with the CG at the aft limit. If the requirements can be met in this configuration, the ability to maintain directional control will be enhanced at any other CG location.

With regards to this question, As the bank angle is decreased from 5 degrees to 0 degrees, the value of VMCA increases. CORRECT When an engine failure occurs during level flight, in order to maintain wings level, a lot of rudder input is necessary. An increase in bank (usually around 2-5º bank angle), reduces the required rudder input, which provides more controllability, decreasing VMCA. But when decreasing the bank angle below 5º (to 0º), rudder deflection has to be increases and, therefore, VMCA will increase too. VMCA is certified with a bank angle of not more than 5º towards the operating engine, because a lower figure can be obtained compared with wings level. When the bank angle is increased beyond 5 degrees, there is an increasing risk of fin stall. CORRECT An increased bank angle beyond 5º, while keeping the rudder centred, may lead us to encounter a new dangerous situation – sideslip towards the live engine, which could possibly send the fin’s angle of attack beyond critical alpha, leading to a fin stall. Control of the aircraft will be immediately lost.",

Load Factor = Lift / Weight Where, Lift = 1⁄2 x ρ x V2 x CL x S LOAD FACTOR IN A TURN When an aircraft is in a banked turn, lift must be increased so as to maintain the vertical component of lift equal to weight. Load Factor (n) increases with bank angle at an increasing rate. If speed is kept constant, but the bank angle increased, the angle of attack must also be increased to provide the increased lift required. Because induced drag is a component of the lift force, the greater the lift, the greater will be the induced drag. Lift must be equal to weight in level flight so induced drag will depend on the weight of the aircraft. Induced drag will be greater at higher aircraft weights. Certain manoeuvres require the lift force to be greater than the aircraft weight For example, lift is greater than weight during a steady turn so induced drag will be higher during a steady turn than in straight and level flight. Therefore, induced drag also increases as the Load Factor increases. Induced drag will increase in proportion to the square of the lift force: CDI = CL2 / AR In this example, doubling the Load factor requires the Lift Coefficient to be double as well (considering all other factor remain constant). From the above formula, we can conclude that doubling the Lift Coefficient will cause the Induced Drag Coefficient to be 4 times greater.",

            "explanation": "Consider an aircraft in a straight steady climb along a straight flight path inclined at an angle (γ) to the horizontal. γ (gamma) is the symbol used for climb angle. The forces on the aircraft consist of Lift, normal to the flight path; Thrust and Drag, parallel to it; and Weight, parallel to the force of gravity. Weight is resolved into two components: one opposite Lift (W cos γ) and the other acting in the same direction as Drag (W sin γ), backwards along the flight path. The requirements for equilibrium are: Thrust must equal the sum of Drag plus the backwards component of Weight; and Lift must equal its opposing component of Weight. For equilibrium at a greater angle of climb, the Lift required will be less, and the backwards component of Weight will be greater. L = W cosγ T = D + W sinγ In a straight steady climb, Lift is less than Weight because Lift only has to support a proportion of the weight, this proportion decreasing as the climb angle increases. The remaining proportion of Weight is supported by engine Thrust. It can be seen that for a straight steady climb the Thrust required is greater than Drag. This is to balance the backward component of Weight acting along the flight path. The climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = (T−D)/W For very shallow flight path angles (γ), we can assume that lift is approximately equal to Weight, therefore the climb gradient can be described as: sin γ = T/W−D/L In this exercise, Weight is equal to 500000 N, D/L ratio is equal to 1/12 and Thrust equal to 28000 N per engine. For the all engines (three) climb gradient and applying the formula defined above: sin γ = (84000/500000) −(1/12) sinγ = 0.085 ⇒ sinγ = 8.5% The climb gradient is 8.5%.",

As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces.

            "explanation": "ENGINE FAILURE If one engine on a conventional twin-engine aircraft fails in flight, it adversely affects its performance and controllability. With both engines operating at the same power setting on a twin-engine aircraft, the amount of thrust produced by each engine is identical and their lines of action are symmetrically displaced about the aircraft's normal axis. If one engine fails in flight, the remaining thrust forces are asymmetrically displaced and the aircraft yaws in the direction of the failed engine. YAWING MOMENT The yawing moment is the product of thrust from the operating engine multiplied by the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm), plus the drag from the failed engine multiplied by the distance between the engine centre line and the CG. The strength of the yawing moment will depend on: - how much thrust the operating engine is developing (throttle setting and density altitude). - the distance between the thrust line and the CG (thrust arm). - how much drag is being produced by the failed engine. The rudder moment, which balances the yawing moment, is the result of the rudder force multiplied by the distance between the fin CP and the CG (rudder arm) The ability of the pilot to counteract the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust will depend on: - rudder displacement (affecting rudder force). - CG position (affecting rudder arm). - the IAS (affecting rudder force). Rudder to Stop Yaw - Bank Towards Live Engine It is more aerodynamically efficient to balance the rudder sideforce by banking towards the live engine, so that lift gives a sideways component opposite to the rudder force. The angle of bank must not exceed 5°, to prevent excessive loss of vertical lift component. Banking towards the live engine also reduces the side force on the fin from sideslip, which minimizes VMC, effectively reduces the yawing moment and gives more rudder authority to stop the yaw. The cockpit indication will be the turn needle central with the slip indicator (ball) one half diameter displaced towards the live engine. The ‘ball’ is not centred, but the aircraft is not sideslipping.",

            "explanation": "In level flight, any turn will be coordinated or uncoordinated. A coordinated turn is one in which the only acceleration is along the normal axis of the airplane, towards the center of the turn, and the angle of bank is precisely correct for the aircraft speed and the radius of turn. If not all these factors are present, the turn will be uncoordinated and there will be a lateral acceleration either towards or away from the center of the turn. The total lift of a balanced turn provides the centripetal force and the force that opposes the mass of the airplane. If there is acceleration towards the center of the turn the airplane is slipping and if it is away from the center of the turn the airplane is skidding. Either condition will be indicated on the turn and slip indicator. An overbanked airplane will slip into the turn and requires an increase of speed or a reduction in bank angle to correct this condition. An underbanked airplane will skid out of the turn, which requires a decreased speed or an increased bank angle to correct this condition. These are indicated on the turn and slip indicator by the needle one-way and the ball the other. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. In a turn, turn radius and rate of turn are defined as: Turn radius = TAS 2/g tan Φ Rate of Turn = g tan Φ/TAS Therefore, turn radius is directly proportional to TAS squared and inversely proportional to bank angle and Rate of Turn is directly proportional to bank angle and inversely proportional to TAS. In this exercise, TAS is equal to 200 knots and the bank angle is 45°: First, convert 200kt to m/s: 200kt x 0.5144 = 102.88m/s Then, calculate the turn radius Turn radius = 102.88 2/10 x tan 45 Turn radius ≈ 1058.43m The circumference is given by: c = 2 * π * r c = 2 * π * 1058.43 c = 6650.31 m At 102.88 m/s, it would take approximately 65 seconds to complete the circumference.",

But since level flight must be maintained, the component of lift has to be equal to weight. Consequently, lift must be increased. By increasing the bank angle, load factor increases. Due to increased lift, induced drag also increases producing greater drag, this in turn increases total drag. For a given aircraft mass the maximum climb gradient will occur when the excess thrust over drag is greatest. As seen above, the drag increases in a turn, provided that thrust remains the same, the climb gradient will decrease.",
