It moves North in the Northern Hemisphere Summer and South in the Northern Hemisphere Winter. The ITCZ is subject to large seasonal movement overland, but much less over the sea. This is because water has a much higher specific heat capacity than rock, so builds up and loses temperature much slower than land does (about 4x slower), and the oceans have some mixing which makes the effect even stronger. This means that the \"hottest\" part of the ocean does not move much between December and June, whereas the \"hottest\" part of the land moves a long way (following The Sun). This \"hottest\" part of the surface dictates the ITCZ in that area, the \"thermal equator\".",

This is a change from wet and cold conditions one side of a mountain, to warmer and drier conditions on the other (leeward) side. - How does it form? When air is forced upwards over elevated terrain (upwind side of the mountain, in this case, the south), it expands and cools adiabatically (at the DALR) until it saturates. After saturation, it will continue to cool at the SALR. Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain/snow above the mountain’s upwind slopes. By the time it reaches the peak and stops climbing, the air is quite dry. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. On the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. With regards to this question, with a south wind - the south side is the upwind side => where the air is forced up the mountains, cooling down and condensing - forming clouds. The north side is the leeward/downwind side, where air descends and becomes drier and warmer => little or no precipitation is expected.",

Further information: MONSOONS A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons lead to distinct wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics and are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Weather depends very much on the track followed. There are three monsoon flows; the NE, NW & SW. NE MONSOON: In winter – December, January and February, the ITCZ moves further south. Winds blow from the winter Siberian high – bringing cool and dry continental air. The NE Monsoon gives clear weather over central India, Burma and Thailand. It also affects SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast of West Malaysia. However, in these locations, the over sea tracks pick up moisture which produces convective clouds and thunderstorms (when crossing mountain ranges). NW MONSOON: When crossing the Equator, NE Monsoon backs, giving rise to the NW Monsoon which brings Convective clouds (Cu, Cb) and thunderstorms to North Australia and New Guinea. SW MONSOON: In Summer – June, July and August, the ITCZ moves further north, away from the Equator. As the SE trade wind crosses the equator, it veers to SW – giving rise to the SW Monsoon. This Monsoon has a long sea track where it picks up moisture, producing heavy Cumulus and Cumulonimbus clouds with heavy thunderstorms, low cloud bases and severe turbulence (having more serious effects on flying than the NE Monsoon). The SW Monsoon affects all of India, Sri Lanka, Burma, exposed coasts of West Malaysia and West African coast (Guinea, Ghana and North Nigeria).",

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Mountain waves (or standing waves) are therefore very dangerous to aircraft, and if the right conditions exist, mountain waves can continue as high as the tropopause in some cases. There are some tell-tale signs of mountain waves though. Lenticular clouds (cloud type lenticularis) are clouds which are shaped like a lens, and they stay in the same location, even though the wind in their location is strong. They are indicative of the presence of mountain waves, and look very smooth, but actually contain lots of windshear and turbulence nearby and within them. Wind rotors exist in the region of lenticular clouds, and sometimes have associated roll/rotor clouds, which are also indicative of severe turbulence.",

Please send us any further feedback you can remember from the real exam via the comments, your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can verify and improve the question, thank you! A Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is the type that forms storms. For a CB to form, there must be three things; instability, moisture, and a trigger (something which forces air to rise). When the cloud forms and the air is rising in an unstable air mass, the rising air does not cool down at the same rate as the surrounding environment, and this is what we call instability. This means that the rising air wants to continue rising with more and more velocity. When instability and moisture are great enough, these clouds can form large CBs, which continue to accelerate as long as instability exists. If the air becomes more stable, then the cloud's development will slow down (as it no longer has as much of a temperature difference with the surrounding air. This is most commonly seen at the tropopause, where the surrounding air temperature stops changing (an isothermal layer), and all CBs are stopped at the tropopause, flowing outwards to form an \"anvil\" shape (sometimes overshooting with a small \"hat\" from the excess velocity). Isothermal layers are inherently very stable, as the rising air cools as it rises, so will never be the same temperature as air which remains the same temperature. This means that inversions are even more stable. Stability is based on the environmental lapse rate (ELR - the rate at which the surrounding air cools with temperature) vs the Dry or Wet Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR or SALR) of the rising parcel of air. The DALR is constant and the SALR is close to constant, but the ELR varies massively. The greater the ELR (greater temperature drop per 1000 ft), the less stable the atmosphere. When the ELR is 0 (isothermal layer), or an inversion occurs, the air is absolutely stable. A strong inversion in the mid layers of the troposphere (so 10 - 20,000 ft) would stop a CB's development very quickly indeed. All of a sudden, the rising air in the CB would not be warmer than the surrounding air, and would stop or sink instead of rising. The cloud would have no further development above this point.",

It forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. It will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or change of direction. It will also be dispersed if the water becomes colder or the air becomes warmer (the temperature difference reduces). To look at each option: \"Radiation cooling and the creation of a ground inversion.\" This means that the low-level air is getting colder, which would not dissipate the sea smoke. \"Calm winds, allowing the build-up of high-level stratus clouds.\" Calm winds allow the formation of sea smoke, and high level clouds do not really affect it. \"Inflow of warm air at higher levels, reducing relative humidity.\" High level changes do not affect sea smoke formation/dissipation. It is a low-level phenomenon only. \"Inflow of unstable air, dissipating any surface inversion.\" This is correct. Unstable air without a surface inversion will be warmer near the surface, so the sea smoke will dissipate as the air temperature rises above the dewpoint.",

As the warm air rises, it cools adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), and when it reaches its dew point temperature (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture), water vapor starts to condense into tiny water droplets. These droplets cluster together to form visible cumulus clouds. These clouds can grow rapidly, when the atmosphere is unstable, with no upper-air inversion, and may develop into cumulonimbus clouds, with their tops reaching the tropopause. The vertical extent of cumulus clouds is limited by the stability of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is stable, meaning that the temperature increases with height (inversion). A subsidence inversion occurs when there is a layer of sinking or subsiding air in the atmosphere. This sinking air warms adiabatically (without heat exchange) as it descends, causing a temperature increase with height. This warm layer acts as a lid or cap on the rising warm air, preventing it from ascending further.",

            "explanation": "FRONTAL FOG. Occurs most often at a warm front or occlusion. It is most commonly caused by the evaporation of warm rain falling into colder, drier air beneath. It also exists from the gradual reduction of cloud base to the surface, which is also considered fog. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only a few hours before the front passes and it clears. Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the front (due to increasing temperatures and surface winds). As this question eludes to, the fog may not disappear immediately after the surface front passes, as the \"low cloud\" which we class as fog may be still yet to pass, so the fog will likely dissipate over a few minutes. Note: There is conflicting feedback on this question, and whilst we think the current correct answer is most correct, we disagree with the wording slightly, that the fog would clear only \"slowly\" after the front has passed. Any further exam feedback (including the exam authority if possible) would be very useful to verify the correct answer.",

When temperature rises during the day, dew point spread will increase and cloud base will be higher. When Relative Humidity is low, you would expect a HIGH cloud base. On the other hand, a lower difference between temperature and dew point (and, consequently, High Relative Humidity), leads to a LOWer cloud base. To calculate cloud tops, we need to know the SALR and ELR => cloud tops are located where SALR meets ELR. Why? Because air in clouds is rising with SALR - air is saturated (moist). Saturated air cools down slower and as long as enough moisture is available the cloud will keep growing. When SALR = ELR (temperature of air parcel in cloud = temperature of environment) the parcel of air cannot ascend (rise) any more because there is no difference in temperature (no difference in density). Hence, top of clouds is defined.",

Frontal fog is a term that can be used to describe any fog that was caused by frontal activity, so includes the \"hill fog\" mentioned in the question, which is actually just cloud that is low enough to touch the high ground. The more common definition of frontal fog is a special type of fog that only happens under a warm front, just before it passes. Before a warm front passes, we are in a cold sector, so the air is cold, and therefore the ground is relatively cold as well. There is, however, warmer rain falling from above, at least towards the latter stages of the front passing. This is warm rain falling through cold air, and tends to bring a high amount of humidity to the air it goes through. This humidity is most when the warm rain hits the cold ground and begins to evaporate. At this point, we have a lot of humidity in cold air, which leads to the air becoming quickly saturated, and frontal fog is formed. Sometimes this is complemented by stratus fractus, which are small patches of stratus cloud that hang in the air.",

If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. TURBULENCE INVERSION - often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists. SUBSIDENCE INVERSION - develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and, as a result, the lapse rate of temperature is reduced. If the air mass sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion. FRONTAL INVERSION - occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below.",

High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation. Calm or very light wind – which will result in rapid cooling. 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence => promotes a thicker layer.

The trigger for the formation of cumulus clouds is heating from below. This heating can occur due to the warming of the Earth's surface by sunlight. As the surface heats up, it warms the air above it. When this warm air rises, it cools and condenses to form cumulus clouds. The vertical growth of cumulus clouds is restricted by a subsidence inversion. A subsidence inversion occurs when descending air in the atmosphere creates a layer of warmer air above cooler air. This layer acts as a barrier to vertical air movement, preventing further upward growth of the cumulus cloud. It inhibits the vertical development of the cloud, leading to the characteristic flattened appearance of cumulus clouds.",

They are fairly distinct and easy to classify in relation to other clouds: they’re a cumulus cloud that’s wider than tall. They’re flattened cumulus and are generally found low in altitude. Its vertical growth is usually restricted by the existence of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere - cooling of the surface stops convection and increases stability in the airmass which causes clouds to dissipate. Within the cloud, ascending currents of about 2–5 m/s (7–17 ft/s) may be encountered. Turbulence is sometimes severe, especially during the formation and growth of the cloud, and it diminishes when the cloud is mature. Air below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the thermals that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride. To avoid turbulence where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops.",

It is caused when cold air (usually from a land mass) moves over a (comparatively) warmer sea = advection of very cold air over warm water. The small amount of evaporation from the sea is enough to cause saturation and condensation in the air close to the surface. A surface inversion has to be in place (and is usually because of cooling from the cold land mass) so this sea smoke does not continue rising into clouds. Steam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. Forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. Will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or certain change of wind direction. Whereas clouds and fog are usually formed due to cooling of air, this is a case of fog being formed by increasing the humidity of the air. The best way to remember sea smoke is to think of a hot tub in a very cold climate, it forms \"steam fog\" in the same way that sea smoke occurs, just with a bigger temperature difference.",

Additionally, \"NSC\" indicates that there are no significant clouds. The wind direction is 220º at 5 KT. The temperature and dew point are both reported as 03/03, which indicated high relative humidity. Fog is indicated in the METAR as \"FG\" when visibility is less than 1 000 meters due to water droplets. It is most commonly radiation fog, formed through ground cooling at night. Radiation fog typically has a shallow vertical extent, up to a few hundred feet. It requires a clear sky, high relative humidity, and light wind (2-8 knots) to form. The clear sky enhances terrestrial radiation, high humidity enables condensation, and light wind prevents fog droplets from settling and helps bring warmer air to the ground, thickening the fog.",

Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the front Note: Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments, via the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The question makes it clear that the cloud on the left is a different one to that of the CB with an anvil, but we are unsure of the altitude we are cruising at, and the description is quite confusing. The word \"fluffy\" that could refer to cumuliform clouds (or any clouds up close really), but this rather contradicts the word \"consistent\", which refers more to stratiform clouds. If we are at high altitude, then the clouds described could well be any form of Cirrus, Cirrostratus. At medium levels, it could be altostratus, and at low levels, we are not really sure which clouds could fit this description (perhaps cumulus, depending on how you consider the word \"consistent\"). In the end, we cannot really identify the exact cloud from this question, so we have to work off its features and which answer best fits those features. Nonetheless, let's assume high or medium levels for now (we are in the cruise, so these are most likely), and look through the options: \"Heavy drizzle\" This is not correct as the cloud is fully white, which usually means that it is not rain bearing. \"Severe turbulence and icing\" These effects are only experienced in CBs or large TCUs, and the question makes it clear that this cloud is not one of those. \"Clear and calm weather conditions.\" Whilst this could be somewhat correct when it comes to precipitation and turbulence, we would say that the word \"clear\" is contradictory, as how can a cloud be \"clear weather conditions\"? There is also nothing to say that the wind is calm (i.e. nil wind), if that is what they mean by \"calm\". \"No specific weather related effects.\" In the case of cirrus, cirrostratus, or even some altostratus, there are no undue effects from flying through these clouds. Some altostratus may contain the possibility for icing though, due to their level. Therefore, we think this is the most correct of the current options.",

Once all the moisture has condensed, cloud formation ceases. However, the presence of an inversion, often referred to as an isothermal layer, disrupts this upward motion. Inversions occur when the rising air encounters a layer of air that is warmer, causing it to halt its ascent. Consequently, inversions frequently cap clouds and fog layers. Moreover, an inversion inhibits the vertical movement of other atmospheric particles contained within the air pocket. As a result, an area above an inversion layer typically remains clear of clouds, smog, mist, and haze, among other things. In addition, there is an increase in wind speed above the inversion compared to just below it, resulting in significant wind shear at the inversion layer.",

Basically, up and down currents within clouds, which lead to their vertical development, are decided by humidity and temperature differences (between the cloud and the surroundings) - if the air temperature is equal or higher than the cloud's temperature, clouds will stop growing. In simple words, a temperature inversion is a thin layer of the atmosphere where the normal decrease in temperature with height switches to the temperature increasing with height. It acts like a lid, keeping normal convective overturning of the atmosphere from penetrating through the inversion. Some of the effects it might have: An inversion might cause clouds just below the inversion to spread out and take on a flattened appearance. Still another effect is to prevent thunderstorms from forming. Even in an air mass that is hot and humid in the lowest layers, thunderstorms will be prevented if an inversion in the lower atmosphere is keeping this air from rising. The conceptual opposite of a temperature inversion is an unstable air layer.",

Early feedback and knowledge leaned on the side of \"Diurnal solar heating\", but most recent feedback shows the cold front to be the correct answer. See the comments for the most recent feedback. UPDATE: The Hungarian CAA have approved an appeal based on this question (which said that two correct answers were present), stating, \"The cold front is the right option, because clearance occurs with a change of air mass, or less commonly with an increase in surface wind. The term \"on its own” means the weather phenomena associated with cold front. Of course not the definition of cold front will improve the visibility, but the phenomena. Hovewer diurnal solar heating can also be a correct answer.\" We think that the cold front and diurnal solar heating are both perfectly correct, so we hope that they have removed this question from the database now. If this comes up in an exam, you may appeal it, quoting the Hungarian CAA above if necessary. Advection fog is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion. The surface can be land or sea and it can appear by day or night. Most commonly, the dissipation of advection fog is by a change of air mass, replacing the moist air with dry air. For example, in this question, the movement of a cold front would mean that the new air is not the same air than cooled overnight close to the ground, and so the advection fog will dissipate. However, sometimes solar heating on the land is sufficient to raise the temperature to the condensation point and the fog evaporates.",

This forms clouds, when the temperature drops below the dew point as air rises. As the clouds are being forced to rise by the terrain (and we have not been told that precipitation has yet begun to fall), the airmass is cooling, and the colder air will not be able to hold as much moisture in vapour form, so more and more of the stored vapour will condense into droplets or ice crystals (depending on the freezing level). As this is unlikely to make the current droplets/crystals larger due to the rate of coalescence usually being lower than the rate of droplet formation, the only possible correct answer is that the concentration of droplets/crystals in the cloud will increase.",

The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level - it is also the height of the cloud base. The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to the dew point temperature. Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud. There are two ways by which saturation is reached. (a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more. (b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to 'hold' any more water. => Therefore, we can conclude that 2 unsaturated parcels of air will form a cloud when they cool down to the dew point temperature, becoming saturated => and condensation starts.",

In the troposphere, inversions cause an incredibly stable layer of atmosphere, which reduces the upwards motion of cumuliform clouds, and limits the vertical extent of stratiform clouds completely. Stratiform clouds can form for many reasons, such as turbulence in the air causing mixing, orographic or frontal uplift, etc., but they always occur in a stable layer of atmosphere. When the air gets pushed up or mixed up enough to reach its dewpoint, the cloud base forms, and if the air is raised above this, then the cloud continues upwards as high as the air is pushed/mixed. An inversion, however, is much too stable, and any air moving into the inversion will either fall back out of the layer, as the layer is a lot warmer than the air below (preventing mixing of the air), or just warm up above the dewpoint and stop forming cloud. This means that stratiform clouds remain below an inversion in the atmosphere, and this limits their growth.",

Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or when the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated. Freezing fog occurs when fog forms at temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain liquid. They become supercooled water droplets (SCWDs) remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This is the same process as having SCWD within a cloud. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals are formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind, or on the leading edge of a wing that flies through it. Freezing fog can cause ice accumulation on the aircraft and the ground, so is also a dangerous weather phenomenon if not treated correctly.",

We have some slightly conflicting feedback about wording for this one, so please let us know if you see either question in the exam, and what you can remember about them, thank you! RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly occurring in autumn and winter. The cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it (which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as a ground inversion. Inversions are very stable areas, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air inside the inversion drops below its dewpoint CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog. Calm or very light wind – any heavier wind (above 8 kt) causes turbulent mixing of the lower air, breaking up the ground inversion, and lifting the fog into low stratus cloud. Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a much better heat conductor than sea surface. To go through the options: \"In the inversion layer there is a lot of turbulence, which causes the formation of fog.\" There is very little turbulence in an inversion layer. \"The decrease of temperature with the height close to the surface is abnormally high.\" In a ground inversion, the air above the ground increases with height until the top of the inversion is reached, which is the opposite of this option. \"The air cools down close to the ground, without any convection.\" Correct. The air in contact with the ground cools down by conduction, which makes the air close to the ground much colder than the air above it, this is an inversion, and when that air reaches its dew point, fog will form. \"In the inversion layer the air is unstable, which allows significant cooling close to the ground. An inversion is always an absolutely stable layer of air.",

Wind speeds over 5 kts are sufficient for advection fog formation, but the speeds of around 15 kts provide the conditions for maximum vertical development of advection fog. COLD SURFACE. Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation. Movement of air over damp ground or water surface increases its humidity. HUMID AIR. High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE.

It is a type of cumulus cloud that is tall and large, often associated with thunderstorms. TCU indicates the presence of ‘thermals’, and may grow into Cb if conditions are right. One of the key differences in appearance between a towering cumulus and a cumulonimbus cloud is the size. A towering cumulus cloud is a large, white, fluffy cloud that can reach great heights, but it is not as tall and wide as a cumulonimbus cloud. Another difference is that a cumulonimbus cloud often has an anvil-shaped top, which is caused by the cloud reaching the upper limit of the troposphere and the winds spreading the top of the cloud out horizontally. Also, cumulonimbus clouds are more likely to produce thunderstorm and lightning than towering cumulus clouds.",

High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog.

Formed over land by surface heating soon dissipates at night because insolation stops and the cloud droplets evaporate. The cloud base will vary due to the varying temperatures on the ground surfaces. Its height is determined by local temperature, i.e. in hot weather, the cloud or cloud base is higher in the sky, whereas in cold and wet days, the base is lower It is possible to calculate cloud height using the following method: (Air temperature at surface – dew point temperature) x 400 As you can see, the warmer the temperature => the higher the cloud base",

            "explanation": "050.05.02.01.08: Explain the relationship between moisture content and visibility during different types of winter precipitation (e.g. large vs small snowflakes). Moisture content and type of precipitation are the main factors of visibility during precipitation. For instance, rain has relatively good visibility, as the light is scattered a little through each raindrop, but they are relatively see through still. More importantly, rain is a very dense form of precipitation, as so there are less raindrops than for a snow shower of the same moisture content. Snow, therefore, has quite poor visibility, depending on the intensity of course. A light snow shower would still have better visibility than a heavy tropical rain shower. For this question, we should consider each option: A) \"Visibility in precipitation with large snow flakes is worse than in rain.\" This is absolutely correct, snow flakes give worse visibility than rain. Large snowflakes are worse still, as they block more light. B) \"Visibility in a shower with blowing snow is better than in heavy rain.\" Blowing snow is where the wind picks up the snow from the ground and the snow which falls during a snow shower, creating very low visibility indeed, as low as 1 metre visibility. Heavy rain is not as bad as this, so this is incorrect. C) \"Visibility in heavy snow is better than in drizzle with small water droplets.\" I think it is quite obvious that visibility is very bad in heavy snow, and not nearly as bad in drizzle, so this is incorrect. D) \"Regardless of the moisture content, the visibility in rain is worse than in snow.\" As discussed above, it is more difficult to see through snow, which is a much less dense form of precipitation, so takes up more space, and is also more opaque than rain. This is therefore incorrect.",

Hail is less common in the tropics, despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude. Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations. Damaging hail can be met at any height in the cloud, also below the cloud and below the anvil. Hailstorms are most common in the midlatitudes and usually last around 15 minutes. Mountainous areas increase the risk of icing as they help the formation of stratiform or cumuliform clouds with large supercooled water content. Orography enhances the updraft of air and thus enhances the development of water droplets that are large in size - this is mostly on the upwind (windward) side of a mountain and above the ridge. If frontal systems cross a mountain, icing can be extremely strong due to the uplifting effect.",

Within these CB clouds, precipitation particles have the opportunity to grow larger due to the aggregation of ice crystals and supercooled water droplets, ultimately resulting in the formation of hail. When the size of these ice particles exceeds 5 mm, they are referred to as hailstones. As the hailstones continue to grow, they eventually reach a critical size that cannot be sustained by the upward air currents within the cloud. Consequently, they begin to fall from the cloud toward the ground. However, there is a possibility for hailstones to rise again if they are carried into an area with a strong updraft. This process can lead to the repeated aggregation of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstones, contributing to their further growth. This repeated cycle of aggregation and growth results in the layered structure of hailstones, resembling the layers of a cabbage or an onion. Additionally, the hailstone can also grow through sublimation, where water vapor in the cloud condenses directly onto the hailstone, further increasing its size.",

It involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud. There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals. This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature. Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature. Unlike the Bergeron Process, where precipitation forms under supercooled conditions, the COALESCENCE PROCESS typically occurs within relatively warm clouds with tops warmer than -15ºC. As you can tell by the name of this process, the collision of falling and rising droplets is what allows them to grow large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

It is our belief that this question asked in this format has the answer of \"soft hail/graupel\", which are abbreviated to GS, and come from CBs, which obviously contain moderate to severe turbulence. The most recent feedback indicates that two options have \"GS\" in the first part, and we believe those to be correct in the real exam, but for the other two (both incorrect) options, there could be some discrepancies in the real exam. Frozen precipitation can form in many different ways, and in fact, due to the height of clouds, a lot of the time, precipitation falls in frozen form and melts into regular rain on the way down. The size and appearance of frozen precipitation dictates its designation. For instance, the type of precipitation dictated is called soft hail (or graupel), and comes from convective clouds, such as Cb (Cumulonimbus) and tCu (towering cumulus). They are smaller than hail, at under 5 mm diameter, and are formed when snow falls, but collides with supercooled water droplets on the way down, forming a hybrid particle that freezes, forming small opaque balls. The process is remarkably similar to how airframes build up rime ice, but on a much smaller scale. To finish off the question, it is common to associate convective clouds such as Cbs with moderate to severe turbulence.",

To check all the possible answers: Snowfall is far more visibility reducing that ice pellets and freezing rain. Heavy snow is obviously more visibility reducing than light snow, due to the amount. Snowflakes DO obscure more visibility than corresponding water droplets. Hail from thunderstorms would be far more densely packed with ice than corresponding snow, meaning that there would be many times less hailstones than snowflakes, and therefore they would not be as visibility reducing as the snow, which would cover much more of the sky. This makes the most correct answer \"snowflakes, due to their open structure, obscure more than water droplets.\"",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Mountain waves (or standing waves) are therefore very dangerous to aircraft, and if the right conditions exist, mountain waves can continue as high as the tropopause in some cases. There are some tell-tale signs of mountain waves though. Lenticular clouds (cloud type lenticularis) are clouds which are shaped like a lens, and they stay in the same location, even though the wind in their location is strong. They are indicative of the presence of mountain waves, and look very smooth, but actually contain lots of windshear and turbulence nearby and within them. Wind rotors exist in the region of lenticular clouds, and sometimes have associated roll/rotor clouds, which are also indicative of severe turbulence.",

Please send us any further feedback you can remember from the real exam via the comments, your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can verify and improve the question, thank you! A Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is the type that forms storms. For a CB to form, there must be three things; instability, moisture, and a trigger (something which forces air to rise). When the cloud forms and the air is rising in an unstable air mass, the rising air does not cool down at the same rate as the surrounding environment, and this is what we call instability. This means that the rising air wants to continue rising with more and more velocity. When instability and moisture are great enough, these clouds can form large CBs, which continue to accelerate as long as instability exists. If the air becomes more stable, then the cloud's development will slow down (as it no longer has as much of a temperature difference with the surrounding air. This is most commonly seen at the tropopause, where the surrounding air temperature stops changing (an isothermal layer), and all CBs are stopped at the tropopause, flowing outwards to form an \"anvil\" shape (sometimes overshooting with a small \"hat\" from the excess velocity). Isothermal layers are inherently very stable, as the rising air cools as it rises, so will never be the same temperature as air which remains the same temperature. This means that inversions are even more stable. Stability is based on the environmental lapse rate (ELR - the rate at which the surrounding air cools with temperature) vs the Dry or Wet Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR or SALR) of the rising parcel of air. The DALR is constant and the SALR is close to constant, but the ELR varies massively. The greater the ELR (greater temperature drop per 1000 ft), the less stable the atmosphere. When the ELR is 0 (isothermal layer), or an inversion occurs, the air is absolutely stable. A strong inversion in the mid layers of the troposphere (so 10 - 20,000 ft) would stop a CB's development very quickly indeed. All of a sudden, the rising air in the CB would not be warmer than the surrounding air, and would stop or sink instead of rising. The cloud would have no further development above this point.",

It is caused when low-level cold air from a land mass moves over a (comparatively) warmer sea (water surface) = advection of very cold air over a warm sea. The small amount of evaporation from the sea in the cold air just above it is enough to cause saturation and condensation. Steam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. It forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. It will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or change of direction. It will also be dispersed if the water becomes colder or the air becomes warmer (the temperature difference reduces). To look at each option: \"Radiation cooling and the creation of a ground inversion.\" This means that the low-level air is getting colder, which would not dissipate the sea smoke. \"Calm winds, allowing the build-up of high-level stratus clouds.\" Calm winds allow the formation of sea smoke, and high level clouds do not really affect it. \"Inflow of warm air at higher levels, reducing relative humidity.\" High level changes do not affect sea smoke formation/dissipation. It is a low-level phenomenon only. \"Inflow of unstable air, dissipating any surface inversion.\" This is correct. Unstable air without a surface inversion will be warmer near the surface, so the sea smoke will dissipate as the air temperature rises above the dewpoint.",

As the warm air rises, it cools adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), and when it reaches its dew point temperature (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture), water vapor starts to condense into tiny water droplets. These droplets cluster together to form visible cumulus clouds. These clouds can grow rapidly, when the atmosphere is unstable, with no upper-air inversion, and may develop into cumulonimbus clouds, with their tops reaching the tropopause. The vertical extent of cumulus clouds is limited by the stability of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is stable, meaning that the temperature increases with height (inversion). A subsidence inversion occurs when there is a layer of sinking or subsiding air in the atmosphere. This sinking air warms adiabatically (without heat exchange) as it descends, causing a temperature increase with height. This warm layer acts as a lid or cap on the rising warm air, preventing it from ascending further.",

It also exists from the gradual reduction of cloud base to the surface, which is also considered fog. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only a few hours before the front passes and it clears. Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the front (due to increasing temperatures and surface winds). As this question eludes to, the fog may not disappear immediately after the surface front passes, as the \"low cloud\" which we class as fog may be still yet to pass, so the fog will likely dissipate over a few minutes. Note: There is conflicting feedback on this question, and whilst we think the current correct answer is most correct, we disagree with the wording slightly, that the fog would clear only \"slowly\" after the front has passed. Any further exam feedback (including the exam authority if possible) would be very useful to verify the correct answer.",

When temperature rises during the day, dew point spread will increase and cloud base will be higher. When Relative Humidity is low, you would expect a HIGH cloud base. On the other hand, a lower difference between temperature and dew point (and, consequently, High Relative Humidity), leads to a LOWer cloud base. To calculate cloud tops, we need to know the SALR and ELR => cloud tops are located where SALR meets ELR. Why? Because air in clouds is rising with SALR - air is saturated (moist). Saturated air cools down slower and as long as enough moisture is available the cloud will keep growing. When SALR = ELR (temperature of air parcel in cloud = temperature of environment) the parcel of air cannot ascend (rise) any more because there is no difference in temperature (no difference in density). Hence, top of clouds is defined.",

Frontal fog is a term that can be used to describe any fog that was caused by frontal activity, so includes the \"hill fog\" mentioned in the question, which is actually just cloud that is low enough to touch the high ground. The more common definition of frontal fog is a special type of fog that only happens under a warm front, just before it passes. Before a warm front passes, we are in a cold sector, so the air is cold, and therefore the ground is relatively cold as well. There is, however, warmer rain falling from above, at least towards the latter stages of the front passing. This is warm rain falling through cold air, and tends to bring a high amount of humidity to the air it goes through. This humidity is most when the warm rain hits the cold ground and begins to evaporate. At this point, we have a lot of humidity in cold air, which leads to the air becoming quickly saturated, and frontal fog is formed. Sometimes this is complemented by stratus fractus, which are small patches of stratus cloud that hang in the air.",

GROUND INVERSION - develops when air is cooled by contact with a colder surface until it becomes cooler than the overlying atmosphere; this occurs most often on clear nights, when the ground cools off rapidly by radiation. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. TURBULENCE INVERSION - often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists. SUBSIDENCE INVERSION - develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and, as a result, the lapse rate of temperature is reduced. If the air mass sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion. FRONTAL INVERSION - occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below.",

The trigger for the formation of cumulus clouds is heating from below. This heating can occur due to the warming of the Earth's surface by sunlight. As the surface heats up, it warms the air above it. When this warm air rises, it cools and condenses to form cumulus clouds. The vertical growth of cumulus clouds is restricted by a subsidence inversion. A subsidence inversion occurs when descending air in the atmosphere creates a layer of warmer air above cooler air. This layer acts as a barrier to vertical air movement, preventing further upward growth of the cumulus cloud. It inhibits the vertical development of the cloud, leading to the characteristic flattened appearance of cumulus clouds.",

They are fairly distinct and easy to classify in relation to other clouds: they’re a cumulus cloud that’s wider than tall. They’re flattened cumulus and are generally found low in altitude. Its vertical growth is usually restricted by the existence of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere - cooling of the surface stops convection and increases stability in the airmass which causes clouds to dissipate. Within the cloud, ascending currents of about 2–5 m/s (7–17 ft/s) may be encountered. Turbulence is sometimes severe, especially during the formation and growth of the cloud, and it diminishes when the cloud is mature. Air below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the thermals that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride. To avoid turbulence where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops.",

It is caused when cold air (usually from a land mass) moves over a (comparatively) warmer sea = advection of very cold air over warm water. The small amount of evaporation from the sea is enough to cause saturation and condensation in the air close to the surface. A surface inversion has to be in place (and is usually because of cooling from the cold land mass) so this sea smoke does not continue rising into clouds. Steam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. Forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. Will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or certain change of wind direction. Whereas clouds and fog are usually formed due to cooling of air, this is a case of fog being formed by increasing the humidity of the air. The best way to remember sea smoke is to think of a hot tub in a very cold climate, it forms \"steam fog\" in the same way that sea smoke occurs, just with a bigger temperature difference.",

Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated. Freezing fog occurs when fog forms in temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain as liquid. They become supercooled water droplets remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals is formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind.",

The question makes it clear that the cloud on the left is a different one to that of the CB with an anvil, but we are unsure of the altitude we are cruising at, and the description is quite confusing. The word \"fluffy\" that could refer to cumuliform clouds (or any clouds up close really), but this rather contradicts the word \"consistent\", which refers more to stratiform clouds. If we are at high altitude, then the clouds described could well be any form of Cirrus, Cirrostratus. At medium levels, it could be altostratus, and at low levels, we are not really sure which clouds could fit this description (perhaps cumulus, depending on how you consider the word \"consistent\"). In the end, we cannot really identify the exact cloud from this question, so we have to work off its features and which answer best fits those features. Nonetheless, let's assume high or medium levels for now (we are in the cruise, so these are most likely), and look through the options: \"Heavy drizzle\" This is not correct as the cloud is fully white, which usually means that it is not rain bearing. \"Severe turbulence and icing\" These effects are only experienced in CBs or large TCUs, and the question makes it clear that this cloud is not one of those. \"Clear and calm weather conditions.\" Whilst this could be somewhat correct when it comes to precipitation and turbulence, we would say that the word \"clear\" is contradictory, as how can a cloud be \"clear weather conditions\"? There is also nothing to say that the wind is calm (i.e. nil wind), if that is what they mean by \"calm\". \"No specific weather related effects.\" In the case of cirrus, cirrostratus, or even some altostratus, there are no undue effects from flying through these clouds. Some altostratus may contain the possibility for icing though, due to their level. Therefore, we think this is the most correct of the current options.",

The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity Dissipation of frontal fog: frontal fog moves with the weather front, so it dissipates at a given location if the front passes by.",

Once all the moisture has condensed, cloud formation ceases. However, the presence of an inversion, often referred to as an isothermal layer, disrupts this upward motion. Inversions occur when the rising air encounters a layer of air that is warmer, causing it to halt its ascent. Consequently, inversions frequently cap clouds and fog layers. Moreover, an inversion inhibits the vertical movement of other atmospheric particles contained within the air pocket. As a result, an area above an inversion layer typically remains clear of clouds, smog, mist, and haze, among other things. In addition, there is an increase in wind speed above the inversion compared to just below it, resulting in significant wind shear at the inversion layer.",

In simple words, a temperature inversion is a thin layer of the atmosphere where the normal decrease in temperature with height switches to the temperature increasing with height. It acts like a lid, keeping normal convective overturning of the atmosphere from penetrating through the inversion. Some of the effects it might have: An inversion might cause clouds just below the inversion to spread out and take on a flattened appearance. Still another effect is to prevent thunderstorms from forming. Even in an air mass that is hot and humid in the lowest layers, thunderstorms will be prevented if an inversion in the lower atmosphere is keeping this air from rising. The conceptual opposite of a temperature inversion is an unstable air layer.",

Advection fog is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion. The surface can be land or sea and it can appear by day or night. Conditions necessary for advection fog to form WIND SPEEDS. Up to 15 kts to move the air (may be stronger over sea – up to 20 kts). Wind speeds over 5 kts are sufficient for advection fog formation, but the speeds of around 15 kts provide the conditions for maximum vertical development of advection fog. COLD SURFACE. Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation. HUMID AIR. High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE. The greater the temperature difference between the warmer air and the colder ground, the greater the likelihood of fog formation.",

Early feedback and knowledge leaned on the side of \"Diurnal solar heating\", but most recent feedback shows the cold front to be the correct answer. See the comments for the most recent feedback. UPDATE: The Hungarian CAA have approved an appeal based on this question (which said that two correct answers were present), stating, \"The cold front is the right option, because clearance occurs with a change of air mass, or less commonly with an increase in surface wind. The term \"on its own” means the weather phenomena associated with cold front. Of course not the definition of cold front will improve the visibility, but the phenomena. Hovewer diurnal solar heating can also be a correct answer.\" We think that the cold front and diurnal solar heating are both perfectly correct, so we hope that they have removed this question from the database now. If this comes up in an exam, you may appeal it, quoting the Hungarian CAA above if necessary. Advection fog is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion. The surface can be land or sea and it can appear by day or night. Most commonly, the dissipation of advection fog is by a change of air mass, replacing the moist air with dry air. For example, in this question, the movement of a cold front would mean that the new air is not the same air than cooled overnight close to the ground, and so the advection fog will dissipate. However, sometimes solar heating on the land is sufficient to raise the temperature to the condensation point and the fog evaporates.",

This forms clouds, when the temperature drops below the dew point as air rises. As the clouds are being forced to rise by the terrain (and we have not been told that precipitation has yet begun to fall), the airmass is cooling, and the colder air will not be able to hold as much moisture in vapour form, so more and more of the stored vapour will condense into droplets or ice crystals (depending on the freezing level). As this is unlikely to make the current droplets/crystals larger due to the rate of coalescence usually being lower than the rate of droplet formation, the only possible correct answer is that the concentration of droplets/crystals in the cloud will increase.",

The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level - it is also the height of the cloud base. The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to the dew point temperature. Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the formation of cloud. There are two ways by which saturation is reached. (a) By increasing the water content in the air, e.g. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more. (b) By cooling the air so that it reaches its dew point - this is the temperature at which condensation occurs, and is unable to 'hold' any more water. => Therefore, we can conclude that 2 unsaturated parcels of air will form a cloud when they cool down to the dew point temperature, becoming saturated => and condensation starts.",

Freezing fog occurs when fog forms in temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain as liquid. They become supercooled water droplets remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals is formed.

In the troposphere, inversions cause an incredibly stable layer of atmosphere, which reduces the upwards motion of cumuliform clouds, and limits the vertical extent of stratiform clouds completely. Stratiform clouds can form for many reasons, such as turbulence in the air causing mixing, orographic or frontal uplift, etc., but they always occur in a stable layer of atmosphere. When the air gets pushed up or mixed up enough to reach its dewpoint, the cloud base forms, and if the air is raised above this, then the cloud continues upwards as high as the air is pushed/mixed. An inversion, however, is much too stable, and any air moving into the inversion will either fall back out of the layer, as the layer is a lot warmer than the air below (preventing mixing of the air), or just warm up above the dewpoint and stop forming cloud. This means that stratiform clouds remain below an inversion in the atmosphere, and this limits their growth.",

Fog can form when moisture is added into the air or when the air cools to a point that it becomes saturated. Freezing fog occurs when fog forms at temperatures that are below freezing, and the tiny water droplets in the air remain liquid. They become supercooled water droplets (SCWDs) remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This is the same process as having SCWD within a cloud. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals are formed. This is referred to as rime; rime is a characteristic of freezing fog and is often seen on vertical surfaces exposed to the wind, or on the leading edge of a wing that flies through it. Freezing fog can cause ice accumulation on the aircraft and the ground, so is also a dangerous weather phenomenon if not treated correctly.",

We have some slightly conflicting feedback about wording for this one, so please let us know if you see either question in the exam, and what you can remember about them, thank you! RADIATION FOG. Caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling below dew point of the air in contact with the ground, in conditions of calm or very light wind and clear skies. Radiation fog occurs at night and early morning and usually does not last long after sunrise (about 30 minutes). Predominantly occurring in autumn and winter. The cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it (which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as a ground inversion. Inversions are very stable areas, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air inside the inversion drops below its dewpoint CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog. Calm or very light wind – any heavier wind (above 8 kt) causes turbulent mixing of the lower air, breaking up the ground inversion, and lifting the fog into low stratus cloud. Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a much better heat conductor than sea surface. To go through the options: \"In the inversion layer there is a lot of turbulence, which causes the formation of fog.\" There is very little turbulence in an inversion layer. \"The decrease of temperature with the height close to the surface is abnormally high.\" In a ground inversion, the air above the ground increases with height until the top of the inversion is reached, which is the opposite of this option. \"The air cools down close to the ground, without any convection.\" Correct. The air in contact with the ground cools down by conduction, which makes the air close to the ground much colder than the air above it, this is an inversion, and when that air reaches its dew point, fog will form. \"In the inversion layer the air is unstable, which allows significant cooling close to the ground. An inversion is always an absolutely stable layer of air.",

It is a type of cumulus cloud that is tall and large, often associated with thunderstorms. TCU indicates the presence of ‘thermals’, and may grow into Cb if conditions are right. One of the key differences in appearance between a towering cumulus and a cumulonimbus cloud is the size. A towering cumulus cloud is a large, white, fluffy cloud that can reach great heights, but it is not as tall and wide as a cumulonimbus cloud. Another difference is that a cumulonimbus cloud often has an anvil-shaped top, which is caused by the cloud reaching the upper limit of the troposphere and the winds spreading the top of the cloud out horizontally. Also, cumulonimbus clouds are more likely to produce thunderstorm and lightning than towering cumulus clouds.",

The cooling of air close to the ground causes that air to drop below the temperature of the air just above it (which is not touching the ground), causing a very low-level inversion, known as a ground inversion. Inversions are very stable areas, and these ones in particular create radiation fog when the cold air under the inversion drops below its dewpoint CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation into fog.

High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation. Calm or very light wind – which will result in rapid cooling. 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence => promotes a thicker layer.

            "explanation": "050.05.02.01.08: Explain the relationship between moisture content and visibility during different types of winter precipitation (e.g. large vs small snowflakes). Moisture content and type of precipitation are the main factors of visibility during precipitation. For instance, rain has relatively good visibility, as the light is scattered a little through each raindrop, but they are relatively see through still. More importantly, rain is a very dense form of precipitation, as so there are less raindrops than for a snow shower of the same moisture content. Snow, therefore, has quite poor visibility, depending on the intensity of course. A light snow shower would still have better visibility than a heavy tropical rain shower. For this question, we should consider each option: A) \"Visibility in precipitation with large snow flakes is worse than in rain.\" This is absolutely correct, snow flakes give worse visibility than rain. Large snowflakes are worse still, as they block more light. B) \"Visibility in a shower with blowing snow is better than in heavy rain.\" Blowing snow is where the wind picks up the snow from the ground and the snow which falls during a snow shower, creating very low visibility indeed, as low as 1 metre visibility. Heavy rain is not as bad as this, so this is incorrect. C) \"Visibility in heavy snow is better than in drizzle with small water droplets.\" I think it is quite obvious that visibility is very bad in heavy snow, and not nearly as bad in drizzle, so this is incorrect. D) \"Regardless of the moisture content, the visibility in rain is worse than in snow.\" As discussed above, it is more difficult to see through snow, which is a much less dense form of precipitation, so takes up more space, and is also more opaque than rain. This is therefore incorrect.",

It is mostly formed within continental areas of mid-latitude, since the formation process is likely to take place when the freezing level is below 11 000 ft. Hail is less common in the tropics, despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude. Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations. Damaging hail can be met at any height in the cloud, also below the cloud and below the anvil. Hailstorms are most common in the midlatitudes and usually last around 15 minutes. Mountainous areas increase the risk of icing as they help the formation of stratiform or cumuliform clouds with large supercooled water content. Orography enhances the updraft of air and thus enhances the development of water droplets that are large in size - this is mostly on the upwind (windward) side of a mountain and above the ridge. If frontal systems cross a mountain, icing can be extremely strong due to the uplifting effect.",

Within these CB clouds, precipitation particles have the opportunity to grow larger due to the aggregation of ice crystals and supercooled water droplets, ultimately resulting in the formation of hail. When the size of these ice particles exceeds 5 mm, they are referred to as hailstones. As the hailstones continue to grow, they eventually reach a critical size that cannot be sustained by the upward air currents within the cloud. Consequently, they begin to fall from the cloud toward the ground. However, there is a possibility for hailstones to rise again if they are carried into an area with a strong updraft. This process can lead to the repeated aggregation of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstones, contributing to their further growth. This repeated cycle of aggregation and growth results in the layered structure of hailstones, resembling the layers of a cabbage or an onion. Additionally, the hailstone can also grow through sublimation, where water vapor in the cloud condenses directly onto the hailstone, further increasing its size.",

It involves supercooled water droplets and explains how ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid cloud droplets within a mixed cloud. There are more water molecules surrounding the water droplets than there are surrounding the ice crystals. This occurs because the saturation vapor pressure over a water surface is greater than that over an ice surface at the same temperature. Some of the water droplets will turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the temperature. Unlike the Bergeron Process, where precipitation forms under supercooled conditions, the COALESCENCE PROCESS typically occurs within relatively warm clouds with tops warmer than -15ºC. As you can tell by the name of this process, the collision of falling and rising droplets is what allows them to grow large enough to fall to the ground as precipitation.",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

It is our belief that this question asked in this format has the answer of \"soft hail/graupel\", which are abbreviated to GS, and come from CBs, which obviously contain moderate to severe turbulence. The most recent feedback indicates that two options have \"GS\" in the first part, and we believe those to be correct in the real exam, but for the other two (both incorrect) options, there could be some discrepancies in the real exam. Frozen precipitation can form in many different ways, and in fact, due to the height of clouds, a lot of the time, precipitation falls in frozen form and melts into regular rain on the way down. The size and appearance of frozen precipitation dictates its designation. For instance, the type of precipitation dictated is called soft hail (or graupel), and comes from convective clouds, such as Cb (Cumulonimbus) and tCu (towering cumulus). They are smaller than hail, at under 5 mm diameter, and are formed when snow falls, but collides with supercooled water droplets on the way down, forming a hybrid particle that freezes, forming small opaque balls. The process is remarkably similar to how airframes build up rime ice, but on a much smaller scale. To finish off the question, it is common to associate convective clouds such as Cbs with moderate to severe turbulence.",

Clouds form at altitudes where the temperatures are below the freezing point of water. In these clouds, water exists in its liquid form even though the temperatures are cold enough to freeze water. Water that has a temperature below freezing but is still in a liquid state is called supercooled water. Ice crystals are found co-existing with the super-cooled water in cold clouds. When this occurs, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water droplets. At temperatures below freezing the saturation vapor pressure of ice is less than that over a droplet of water. This means that a water vapor gradient exists between the droplet and the ice. Water can evaporate off the droplet and deposit on the ice in response to the water vapor gradient. The droplet will dissipate in size while the ice crystal grows into a snow flake. Once the snow flake is large enough, it will fall to the surface. Thus, precipitation that falls in the middle and high latitudes starts out as snow. Whether it hits the surface as snow or rain depends on the temperature conditions through which the snowflake falls.",

However, the cold front also has a bulging \"cold nose\" near the surface, creating an unstable area where warm, buoyant air lies beneath cold air.

The lifting of the cold unstable by the mountains results in the formation of more-or-less continuous supercooled clouds. Also, the orographically-induced updrafts permit the air to support larger cloud droplets than otherwise, so that the icing is more intense. Furthermore, dust from the mountain slopes induce ice accretion - due to the presence of freezing nucleus. Freezing nucleus, any particle that, when present in a mass of supercooled water, will induce growth of an ice crystal about itself; most ice crystals in the atmosphere are thought to form on freezing nuclei.

At this low-pressure zone, relatively warm, moist air of the Ferrel Cell runs into relatively cold, dry air of the Polar cell. In the Northern hemisphere: Warm air mass (Tropical airmass) => South; Cold air mass (Polar air mass) => North In the northern hemisphere, the position of the polar front is affected by the seasons: During winter it typically moves to lower latitudes (further south - between 40ºN and 50ºN). Spans from Florida towards the Southern part of Ireland and UK, then curves in a SE direction towards the Northern part of the Black Sea. During SUMMER it is situated further north, closer to the poles (between 50ºN and 65ºN). Spans from Newfoundland (North-Eastern Canada) towards Ireland and UK. Turns towards North of Scotland and continues towards Gulf of Botnia (60º - 65ºN). In the southern hemisphere, the polar front remains almost constant regardless of the season (50ºS).",

            "explanation": "The figure shows a warm front followed by a cold front, a cross section of a very common polar front depression (travelling low). We always look at the fronts like this, with them travelling from left to right on the page. The forward front is a shallower sloped warm front. The steeper front at the back is the cold front. In the warm front, there is cold air ahead, and the new warm air is flowing towards it, which, due to the reduced air density, rises above the cold air. This forces the air upwards, and causes multiple levels of cloud to form. At the lower levels, these clouds are heavy enough to contain rain. Location 1 is after the cold front, where the visibility should be good, and there will be gradually rising clouds above, the remnants of the convective clouds, and maybe some altostratus or cirrus. The other weather conditions will be dependent on the specific air mass properties. Location 2 is just ahead of a cold front, which aggressively forces air to rise, and sets off heavy showers of rain and, in an unstable atmosphere, convective active and cumulonimbus clouds. At location 3, once the warm front has cleared, the weather is that of a warm sector, inside which, the weather is very much dependent on season, the conditions of the source region, and the track of the air mass. In summer, the warm sector will often see good weather and some fair weather cumulus clouds, but moreso will have stable air, stratified clouds, drizzle, light rain and mist in the winter. This would line up with the METAR in the question. At location 4, in the lower layers of a warm front, Nimbostratus clouds cause a wide band of rain and heavy rain ahead of the front, and then as the clouds reach close to the ground, drizzle and frontal fog can begin to form. The lack of heavy rain is the biggest indicator that it is NOT location 1, where heavy rain is pretty much garaunteed.",

In this question, the fast moving cold front over warm land is more \"aggressive\" than the slow moving cold front over cold land. Slower cold fronts (called \"active\" cold fronts) tend to contain more weather as we have eluded to in our explanation for question 508178, but the warm land would likely have a greater effect on the weather than the speed of the front. Immediately we can see that the most likely location for these types of highly convective weather is going to be on the steeper cold front (instead of a warm front), the more aggressive of the two simple weather fronts. Yes, a warm occlusion will include a bit of cold front at altitude, but as it is a warm occlusion, the majority of it acts as a warm front. During summer, the presence of a swiftly advancing cold front over warm land can create highly unstable conditions, leading to moderate to severe turbulence and the development of thunderstorms with substantial rainfall and hail. Additionally, this fast-moving cold front has the potential to generate severe squall line thunderstorms, occurring along or ahead of the actual front.",

Please send us any further exam feedback via the comments, by email to info@atplquestions.com or using the exam feedback section of your dashboard, thanks! POLAR FRONT DEPRESSIONS. These move eastwards along the semi stationary front “Polar front” which is located between 35ºN and 65ºN (higher latitudes in Summer, lower in Winter). An air mass is simply a large portion of air in the Earth's atmosphere, defined by where it has been \"formed\" (a high pressure, stable source region where it develops its initial characteristics) and the track it has taken to get somewhere. For Western Europe, the air masses are classified as T(Tropical), P(Polar) and A(Arctic) - in terms of their thermal qualities - and c(continental) or m(maritime) - in terms of their water content. Note that Artic air is from directly North of Europe, whereas Polar air is from the Polar cell fo the atmosphere, so source regions like Siberia or Northern Canada/Greenland. The Polar front splits Sub-tropical air (which we refer to as Tropical for European air masses) from Polar air. Therefore, when a Polar front depression forms (in the North Atlantic specifically), the warm sector to the South of the depression is that Tropical air, whereas the rest of the depression is surrounded by the Polar air. Therefore, in this question; (1) is Tropical air in the warm sector, (2) is Polar air ahead of the depression (East), and (3) is the Polar air behind the depression (West). (4) is a little more complicated. It is the air North of the depression. From the options, we have already narrowed down the correct answer, and that states that the air North of the depression \"may be\" Arctic. This is not always the case, but certainly possible, especially in Winter when Artic air can easily flow down from the North Pole. Often, for a new depression, this air would also be Polar, but later down the life cycle, it can drag Artic air down to it. Also, the question says \"may be\", rather than \"is\", which we are happy to consider as being correct.",

If you happen to come across a similar question in your official examination, we kindly request that you inform us. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. When a polar front approaches a mountain range in southern Europe, the expected weather conditions can vary. However, there are some general patterns that can be observed. Typically, as the polar front encounters the mountain range, it is forced to rise due to the barrier presented by the mountains. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation. The precipitation can be in the form of rain, snow, or a mix of both, depending on the altitude and temperature. The interaction between the polar front and the mountain range can result in significant weather changes. Some of the common weather conditions associated with this scenario include: Increased precipitation: The forced ascent of the air along the mountain range can lead to enhanced precipitation, potentially causing heavy rainfall or snowfall. Strong winds: The interaction between the polar front and the mountains can generate strong and gusty winds, particularly in the vicinity of the mountain passes and slopes. Thunderstorms: The lifting of warm and moist air along the mountain range can contribute to the development of thunderstorms, especially if there is a strong contrast in air masses. Rapid weather changes: The passage of the polar front can bring about rapid shifts in weather conditions, with alternating periods of rain, sunshine, and possibly even dramatic temperature fluctuations.",

Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Note: Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low. ADVECTION FOG. Is formed by the advection of warm, moist air over a cold surface – the air mass is cooled from below giving rise to an inversion. A common example of this is when a warm front passes over an area with snow cover.",

Cold fronts are typically much faster than warm fronts. The front moves at right angles to itself at a speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) measured along the front. Precipitation associated with a cold front usually affects a narrow area (rain belt) of 50- 100 NM (93 – 185 km) – mainly showery precipitation on both sides of the front, but mostly behind it. A winter cold front in Europe will usually produce more intense weather and precipitation. Clouds: broken to overcast, base low but rising, Cu, CB, sometimes Ns. - Beyond 300 km from the frontal surface - we can find occasional/isolated CU (or CB - mainly in unstable warm air) => giving showery precipitation. - An active cold front with unstable warm air (during summer) will produce cumulonimbus => thunderstorms are likely to occur.",

            "explanation": "OCCLUDED FRONT. If a cold front catches up to and overtakes a warm front, the frontal boundary created between the two air masses is called and occluded front. When the cold front catches up with the warm front, the warm sector is lifted. WARM OCCLUSION: the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air behind the cold front. The cold air behind the cold front rises over colder air ahead of the warm front. The \"less cold\" air rises over the leading colder air. This forces the cold front aloft (It \"climbs up\" the back of the warm front). Warm, moist and unstable air is lifted. The warm front acts as normal, but the extra cold front forces air upwards, causing embedded CBs (they are embedded within the usual warm front clouds). COLD OCCLUSION: the air behind the cold front is colder than the air ahead of the warm front. The cold air behind the cold front undercuts the less cold air ahead of the warm front. Warm front aloft. Warm, moist and stable air is lifted. To go through each option: \"In a warm occlusion, the warm, moist tropical maritime air overrides the cold polar maritime air ahead. Precipitation and radiation fog occur ahead of the surface position of the front.\" Whilst this is partially correct, it refers to a warm front ONLY, and also says radiation fog, which is not correct even for a warm front itself. \"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and cold front. At the surface, it resembles a warm front with embedded CBs. The precipitation falls ahead of the surface position of the front.\" Correct. As can be seen in the explanation and figures above, a warm occlusion is both a warm and a cold front, with exactly these characteristics. \"A warm occlusion is a combination of a warm and a cold front. At the surface, it resembles a cold front with embedded CBs and heavy rain, which are located close to just behind the surface position of the front.\" Incorrect. At the surface it resembles a warm front (the warm front is the one that reaches the ground), and the precipitation occurs in front of the where the front meets the ground. \"In a warm occlusion, the cool polar continental air mass undercuts the colder arctic maritime air mass. The rain band just ahead of the surface position of the front has embedded CBs, severe turbulence, and hail. A thick frontal fog follows the surface position of the front.\" Incorrect, there is no \"undercutting\" in a warm occlusion. All the air rises over the leading air, as the leading air is the coldest (and therefore most dense).",

            "explanation": "WARM FRONT. Warm air replacing cold air. The warm air is forced to rise over the cold air as part of slowly pushing the cold air out of the way Conditions associated with a warm front: Surface winds: A change in wind direction is commonly observed with the passage of any front. Before the front arrives, winds ahead of the front (in the colder air mass) are typically from the South/South-West, but once the front passes through, winds usually veer around, and come from the West/South-West (in the warmer air mass). The wind veering actually tells us nothing, as all standard Northern Hemisphere fronts cause the wind to veer. Temperature: steady before the front. An increase is usually observed at the front. Behind the warm front, it is steady again. Pressure: As the front approaches, the pressure gradually decreases. Then once the front passes, the pressure should remain constant, at the lowest pressure value(whilst within the warm sector). Clouds: As a warm front approaches, the clouds can be expected to begin at high levels about 500 nm ahead of the front, gradually reducing to the ground as the front passes. In stable air, you can expect Cs, Ci, As, Ns, St and some frontal fog. In unstable air, the rising warm air can trigger convective activity, such as Cu or Cb, with a good chance of the CBs being embedded in the surrounding clouds (as mentioned in this question). Precipitation: Heavy rain can be expected ahead of the front. Thunderstorms can occur if the airmass is unstable. The rain tends to turn into drizzle as the front passes. Visibility: Generally poor, due to the potential for fog and drizzle, but this can vary quite a lot depending on the air masses involved. => The real indicators in this question are the pressure (stops reducing), meaning a warm front, and the embedded CBs meaning unstable air.",

These clouds include AC (Altocumulus) and CC (Cirrocumulus) clouds, followed by a sudden appearance of CU (Cumulus) and CB (Cumulonimbus) clouds. These cloud formations are often associated with moderate to severe turbulence. Precipitation: Showers of rain, which can be heavy at times, are generated by CU and CB clouds along the cold front. Depending on the intensity and season, these showers can manifest as rain, snow, or hail, and there is also the possibility of thunderstorms forming. Visibility: Showery precipitation along the cold front typically leads to a reduction in visibility, which can be significant during heavy precipitation and snowfall. However, once the front passes, visibility improves considerably as the falling precipitation helps cleanse the air, removing impurities.",

            ],
            "explanation": "This question is a little tricky as it is asking about the effect of the warm front, not the foehn effect. The warm front means that the air in front of the warm front is colder than the air that comes after the warm front. The warmer air behind rides up over the cooler air in front, creating the slanted front. This slant means that the cloud base drops as the front gets closer to a position. With a few hundred miles to go before the front passes overhead, you can expect high level cirrus clouds, followed by lowering clouds of cirrostratus, altostratus, nimbostratus (rain clouds), and finally low level stratus with some fog and stratus fractus. In relation to this question then, the front is travelling from West to East, so the front is passing over the western faces of the mountains, which will have a very low cloud base and rain/fog. The Eastern faces, however, have yet to be passed over, so will have a higher cloud base than 2 000 ft, and are in the cold sector, so the temperature will be lower there also. There are a few questions that exist similar to this, but without the presence of the warm front. This makes them affected more so by the foehn effect, which is where the windward side of the mountains gets rained on, reducing the moisture in the air, so the air is drier and warmer on the lee-side. The passing of a warm front is a much larger event, and is therefore enough to negate any such temperature change due to the foehn effect.",
