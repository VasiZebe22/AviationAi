Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the \"break even fuel price\". You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop. Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass You would not tanker fuel BECAUSE the destination airport is below minima, but it is suitable to tanker if that is the case, as the extra weight does not affect us in that capability, and in fact, having the extra fuel is nice for potential diversions. However, tankering is a commercial procedure, and if the Commander wishes to take more fuel for weather diversion or holding, they should use \"extra fuel\" for that purpose.",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Operating Mimima means minima for the IFR approach available, i.e. CAT ILS. Planning Mimima for a destination aerodrome are effectively the applicable approach operating minima. The RVR or visibility should be the same as or greater than the minima for the actual approach for a non-precision approach. Planning minima for alternate aerodromes are not the same as the aerodrome operating minima. Generally, higher cloud bases and visibilities are required than the minima. Thus, an alternate aerodrome with a CAT II approach allowing an RVR of 300 m would not be suitable for use as an alternate, unless the weather conditions were CAT I, 550 m RVR or better (allowing a safety margin). During the pre-flight planning procedure, the pilot must consider: Weather at Destination above Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Destination Alternate above Planning minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Take-off Alternate Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. And after Take-off: Weather at Destination must be above Operating minima at ETA. Weather at Destination Alternate must be above Planning minima at ETA. Also, for a twin-engine aircraft, a Take-off alternate within 60 minutes flying time of the Deparure aerodrome with One-Engine-Inoperative must be considered. Therefore, the destination aerodrome can be considered as the Take-off alternate, thus no Additional fuel is required.",

Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 2650 NM by interpolating between 2500 NM and 3000 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 214 000 kg. If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering. Because the savings would be lost due to the excess fuel burn (higher fuel consumption based on the extra fuel mass). With regards to this question, Planned take-off mass: 190 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial. HOWEVER, first we must check if we are limited by the Maximum Take Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass or Maximum tank capacity. Maximum tank capacity is 55 000 kg and we already have 30 000 kg loaded in the tanks - therefore, we can fit in additional 25 000 kg. Our Maximum Take-Off Mass will be the lowest of Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) and Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel: MTOM = 205 000 kg Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel = 180 000 kg + 22 000 kg = 202 000 kg (lowest) => This means that we could carry an amount of fuel equal to 202 000 kg - 190 000 kg = 12 000 kg additional fuel which is the correct answer to this question.",

Use the formula: NAM = NGM x TAS ÷ GS NAM = 4 000 x 450/400 = 4500 NAM Using the table provided, find your optimum aircraft mass for tankering purposes: 1. Enter the table on the left-hand side with your fuel price ratio of 0.90. 2. Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 4500 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 178 000 kg. With regards to this question, planned take-off mass: 170 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial => an additional 8 000 kg (178 000 kg - 170 000 kg) should be carried.

This kind of decision is made largely based on experience and is often closely scrutinised by the Operator, as it adds to costs. Carrying an extra fuel, incurs a fuel penalty, because the increased mass means that the aircraft cruising level and/or performance are reduced. Thus, since the fuel consumption increases, due to the increased aircraft's mass, some of the extra fuel is consumed in carrying the extra mass. Therefore, to compensate for the increased fuel flow, the trip fuel must be increased, so as to have the desired fuel on board above the destination aerodrome.",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price. You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy LOCATION OF THE FUEL EN-ROUTE ALTERNATE (FUEL ERA) AERODROME The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance, the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight plan distance, or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM, whichever is greater. All distances should be calculated in still air conditions. Considering the above we have: “The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance” RADIUS: 1200 NM x 20% = 240 NM “the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight”: 1200 NM x 25% = 300 NM “or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM”: 1200 NM x 20% + 50 = 290 NM, whichever is greater. DISTANCE FROM DESTINATION: 300 NM => REFER TO FIGURE We take 300 NM from the destination aerodrome – that will be the centre of our circle of 240 NM radius => we can conclude that the centre of the circle will be located 900 NM (1200 – 300) from the departure aerodrome. We get ERA “X” located at 660 NM (900 – 240) from Departure aerodrome. Actual “X” is situated at only 600 NM. Therefore, we can conclude that “X” can not be considered an ERA - which means we can’t reduce contingency to 3% and instead we must take 5% contingency. CONTINGENCY: 5% x 7200 kg = 360 kg.

(4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

            "explanation": "Note: The answer here is unconfirmed at the moment, and whilst it is a simple question to calculate, there may be more to the question that has not been fed back to us, such as a policy not to interpolate or to take the most conservative figures, etc. We have chosen to add that interpolation should be used to avoid confusion, but please read the question carefully in the real exam to make your own judgement of what the question requires, it may well be different. Please let us know if you see this question and remember anything about it from the real exam, thank you! The trip fuel is calculated for a flight based on its expected routing, winds, cruise altitude, and aircraft weight. These can change, and therefore there are procedures in place to account for these changes. The addition of contingency fuel covers some of these changes, but a flight's OFP (operation flight plan) will often include a section detailing the change to fuel burn that comes from a weight change (1000 kg increase, for example) or a change in cruise altitude (for instance 2000 ft above or 2000 ft below the planned cruising level). In particular for this question, the weight change could occur from last minute changes to the passenger load, or some extra fuel that the commander decides to take. Any increase in aircraft weight increases the induced drag of the aircraft, thereby increasing the fuel burn. Any decrease in weight will therefore decrease the fuel burn. Applying the reduction in the question, 1500 kg weight reduction is 1.5 x the 1000 kg reduction, so you can just multiply the 205 kg fuel reduction by 1.5 to get a total trip fuel that is 307.5 kg less than the original trip fuel requirement (closest answer 308 kg)",

Because of TAT (-42°C) below the Standard TAT (-32°C) by 10°C, decrease the fuel flow by 3%: 1 927 kg/hr - 58 kg/hr = 1 869 kg/hr. Also, the TAS at FL370 for a mass of 52 500 kg is: 432 kt, but because of TAT below the Standard TAT by 10°C, it decreases to: 432 kt - 10 kt = 422 kt. The aeroplane experiences a 25 kt headwind, thus GS = TAS - 25 kt = 422 kt - 25 kt = 397 kt. So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 150 NM is: Distance / TAS = 150 NM / 397 kt = 0.38 hr.

From the above distance, deduct the air distance of 2000 NM we must cover = 2464 NM - 2000 NM = 464 NM. 4. On the table, find the timing corresponding to 464 NM. There is no distance corresponding to 464 NM - therefore, we must interpolate between 451 NM - 70 min and 472 NM - 73 min => we get roughly 72 min for 464 NM. 5. Find the time necessary to fly 2000 NM. It will be the difference between 359 min and 72 min = 287 min 6. Apply the \"Climb Correction\" For FL350 => a correction of 6 min must be added. 287 min + 6 min = 293 min 7.

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome.

(5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

ISA temperature at FL330 = 15 - 2 x 33 = -51ºC; OAT = -30ºC => Therefore, ISA +21ºC 2. Enter the graph. Draw a vertical line from the bottom of the chart from a value of 720 NM until the Wind Reference Line. 3. From this point, apply the headwind correction equivalent to 20 kts headwind by drawing a slightly curved line upwards until you intersect the 20 kts headwind line. 4. Continue vertically upwards to intersect the FL330 line. From this point, we will have 2 different lines: Find out the fuel required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue horizontally to the right until the \"Landing Weight\" Reference Line. Now, the dashed lines represent FL370 and the solid lines represent FL100. You should usually choose to interpolate between those 2 lines, but here you can just try to parallel the dashed lines for FL370 as a reference since our cruising level of FL330 is much closer to FL370 than FL100. We have interpolated in the annex above for best accuracy, but when drawing these by hand, that kind of accuracy is very difficult to acheive. Continue diagonally to the right following the reference line (FL370) until you intersect the landing mass = 50000 kg (ZFM) + 2000 kg (Final Reserve) + 1000 kg (Alternate Fuel) = 53 000 kg. Now, continue horizontally to the right and read the result of approx 4800 kg. Find out the time required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue vertically up until you intersect the \"29 & ABOVE\" reference line. From this point, continue horizontally to the left until the ISA deviation reference line. Now, apply the ISA deviation correction for ISA +21ºC (slightly off the scale but just use +20) - continue diagonally downwards to the left and read a result of 1.9 hours or 1 h 54 m.

But, when tankering additional fuel, the aircraft's mass increases, thus, the fuel consumption inceases too, incurring extra cost. The decision to tanker fuel is then based on a comparison of the two costs and the sector distance. The figure involves a comparison of cost (by calculation of the fuel price ratio: departure fuel price divided by destination fuel price) and then for a given sector distance, we get the \"OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS\", which is the MTOM that permits fuel tanking. So: If the OPTIMUM TOM < Planned TOM, then do not fuel tank. If the OPTIMUM TOM > Planned TOM, then tanker an extra fuel amount equal to the difference: Planned TOM - OPTIMUM TOM. To get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS, apply the following steps: Enter with the fuel price ratio of 0.915. Move horizontally to the right until cossing the air distance line 2 000 NM. Continue vertically down to get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS 208 000 kg. Also, check if any limit is exceeded: The OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS (208 000 kg) is more than the MTOM (205 000 kg). Thus, the aircraft can not carry more than: MTOM - Planned TOM = 205 000 kg - 185 000 kg = 20 000 kg of extra fuel for tankering purposes. Planned T/O fuel + Extra fuel = 30 000 kg + 20 000 kg = 50 000 kg, which is greater than the Tank capacity (40 000 kg) by 10 000 kg. So, the Extra fuel must be reduced by 10 000 kg to able to be loaded. So, the Revised Extra fuel because of being Tank capacity-limited is: 20 000 kg - 10 000 kg = 10 000 kg. Actual Landing Mass after tankering Extra fuel = Planned TOM - Trip fuel + Extra fuel = 185 000 kg - 18 000 kg + 10 000 kg = 177 000 kg, which is greater than the MLM (175 000 kg) by 2 000 kg. So, the previously Revised Extra fuel (10 000 kg) must be further reduced by 2 000 kg, so as not to exceed the MLM structural limit. So, the Final Revised Extra fuel, because of MLM-limited, is: 10 000 kg - 2 000 kg = 8 000 kg.",

Read corresponding value of 174 200 kg. Third Step: Correct 174 200 kg for climbing. Aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. Intersect cruising speed of 0.82 with our mass at brake release 210 000 kg (\"210\") - find a value of 2.9 (2900 kg) - Note that fuel consumption is higher in climb (resulting in a lighter aircraft) => subtract 2900 kg from 174 200 kg = 171 300 kg Fourth Step: Correct 171 300 kg for descent. Again, aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. For a mass of 170 000 kg (\"170\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg) and for a mass of 180 000 kg (\"180\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg).

N/A FOR (b)(2) – we have a value of 5500 kg + 275 kg = 5775 kg => We will, therefore, choose the highest value which corresponds to (b)(1) => 10 275 kg.

NOTE: An exhaustive explanation has been created so you can understand where the value comes from but no calculation is needed: it needs understanding that when you move the DP closer to destination the amount of fuel needed decrease as in Decision Point procedure the contingency fuel for destination is only from DP to destination. As DP move closer to destination, the contingency fuel decrease.",

Referring to the table which allows us to find the cruise consumption, find the effective range for a weight of 48 000 kg => Enter the first column under “GROSS WT. kg”, track downwards until you find “48 000”, read the value under the second column “0” which corresponds to 48 000 kg. According to the table, the range equals 2862 NAM. TAS can be read off the table. TAS = 426 kt. As OAT = ISA, no temperature correction is applied to TAS. In 2 hours cruise (minimum additional fuel), the distance covered = 2 h x 426 kt = 852 NAM. Since we do not have to travel a distance on the ground, we do not need to compensate for the wind. To determine the aircraft’s weight at the end of the 2 hours, we must subtract the required distance in air miles for 2 h (852 NM) from the effective range (2862 NM) which corresponds to 48 000 kg: 2862 – 852 = 2010 NM Now we must find out to which weight 2010 NM corresponds to: In the table, we can find 2009 NM (which is close enough), corresponding mass = 43900 kg (aircraft mass after 2 hrs flight) Fuel consumption in 2 hrs = 48 000 kg - 43 900 kg = 4100 kg Closest Answer = 4095 kg",

The total amount of fuel required for this commetcial flight should include the following fuel quantities: Taxi fuel + Trip fuel + Contingency fuel + Alternate Fuel + Final reserve fuel. Therefore, we have: Taxi Fuel: The Taxi fuel includes the fuel expected to be used prior to take-off and the fuel consumed by the use of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). In this question, the APU usage at the parking position is 0 minutes. For the calculation of the taxi fuel, we take into consideration the fuel consumption only at the departure aerodrome. Fuel flow during taxi: 11 kg per minute Planned taxi time: 10 minutes Taxi fuel = 11 kg/min x 10 min = 110 kg Trip Fuel: Average fuel flow is 2618 kg/h. We must calculate the flight time. We have TAS = 421 kt and average wind component = - 24 kt (headwind) ⇒ Ground Speed = TAS - Headwind component = 421 kt - 24 kt = 397 kt. With a Ground Speed of 397 kt (397 kt = 397 NM/h), the time required to cover the distance of 748 NM is: Time = Distance/Ground Speed = 748/397 Given that the flight time is 748/397 h and the average fuel flow is 2638 kg/h, the Trip fuel is: Trip fuel = (748/397) h x 2618 kg/h = 4 932.65 kg (approx. 4 933 kg) Contingency fuel: Question states that Contingency fuel is 5% of the Trip fuel. Since the Trip fuel is 4 933 kg, the Contingency fuel is: Contingency fuel = 0.05 x 4 933 kg = 246.65 kg (approx. 247 kg) Alternate fuel: Question states that Alternate fuel equals 550 kg. Final Reserve fuel: According to EASA Air Ops (AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel Policy), the Final reserve fuel for an aeroplane with turbine engines, is the fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1500 ft above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions. From the question, the holding fuel flow is 2 250 kg/h. As a result, the Final reserve fuel is: Final reserve fuel = (30 x 2 250)/60 kg = 1 125 kg The total amount of fuel required for this commercial flight is: Total fuel = 110 kg + 4 933 kg + 247 kg + 550 kg + 1 125 kg = 6 965 kg.",

It is important before flight to check that there will be enough satellites visible for an accurate position at all stages of the flight, and that planned outages, maintenance or orbital corrections are not expected at the time of flight. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. As NOTAMs are the only option here (NANUs are not an option), then that is the correct answer. Also, GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure that those services are available for the time of usage. Augmentation such as GBAS, SBAS and RAIM check for errors and correct them and/or notify the flight deck of integrity faults. RAIM can be checked in advance of making a flight or particular GNSS based procedure, using some onboard avionics systems, or on the ground beforehand using the AUGUR RAIM prediction tool.",

            "explanation": "The answer is VDF and not ATC clearance even though the frequency falls in the VHF Communication range, the NOTAM would mention an alternate frequency if the voice channel transmitter was not available. VHF Direction Finding VDF VDF provides a means of determining the aircraft bearing from a ground station. VDF stations are capable of measuring the direction of arrival of radio transmissions from aircraft. In earlier days, such a service operated in MF, HF, and VHF bands. Today, the service (for civil aviation) operates on frequencies from 118 to 137 MHz in the VHF band. These frequencies are identical with the working frequencies of the aircraft communication radio. If the communications transmitter on an aircraft is tuned to the VDF frequency and the transmitter is activated, the aerials at the VDF unit will detect the incoming transmission and each aerial element will feed a signal to the VDF receiver. Since the aerial elements will all be at slightly different distances from the source of the signal, each will detect a slightly different phase of that signal at the same instant. On some VDF units a simple digital read out gives the bearing. A ground DF station can give true or magnetic bearings. It is common to use the so-called «Q-codes»: QTE True bearing from the station QDR Magnetic bearing from the station QDM Magnetic bearing to the station QTF Position of a station taken by bearings from D/F stations QUJ True bearing to the station In practice, only QDM and QDR are normally used. The accuracy of the bearing is measured in degrees. Bearings are categorised, in accordance with the ICAO defined classifications, as given in the following list: Class A accurate within ± 2° Class B accurate within ± 5° Class C accurate within ± l0° Class D accuracy less than Class C Due to topography, some VDF stations are approved for use within certain sectors only. In that case, specific information for that aerodrome will be given in AIP. Stations that are listed in the AIP provide a ‘homing’ service. Generally the class of bearing is no worse than class B. (Many states will not permit Class C & D bearings to be provided). Ground DF stations should not be used as en-route navigation aids. Source: nordian.net",

We can now apply the formulas: Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home) Distance to PET = (220 x 1000) / (180 + 220) Distance to PET = 550 NM Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out Time to PET = 550 / 180 = 3 h 3 min PET will be reached at: Departure time + Time to PET = 12 h + 3 h 3 = 15 h 3",

This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. Also, GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure they are available for the time of usage. Augmentation such as GBAS, SBAS and RAIM check for errors and correct them and/or notify the flight deck. Furthermore, GNSS NOTAM provide information on individual satellite outages or temporary unavailability of service due to testing or anomalies and service outages at specific airports/airspaces. Therefore, the availability of the relevant satellites and any potential outages must be checked before flight.",

Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Where, E = Safe endurance based on available fuel; H = Ground speed home; 0 = Ground speed out Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 280º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 070º 5. Note that this heading would result in 3ºR drift and a track of 073º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 070º. This occurs at a heading of 067º with 4ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 133 kt. GS out: 250º 5. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 246º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 254º with 4ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 107 kt. We can now apply the formulas: Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Time to PSR = 2.4 x 133 / 107 + 133 = 1.33 h To find the distance from the departure airport to the PSR, we simply multiply the time to PSR by the GS OUT: 1.33 hrs × 107 kts = 142 NM.",

Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 060º 5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 340 kt. GS out: 240º 5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 500 kt. We can now apply the formulas: Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Time to PSR = 12.4 x 340 / 500 + 340 = 5.02 h To find the distance from the departure airport to the PSR, we simply multiply the time to PSR by the GS OUT: 5.02 hrs × 500 kts = 2510 NM.",

Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Where, E = Safe endurance based on available fuel; H = Ground speed home; 0 = Ground speed out Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 105 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 215º 5. Note that this heading would result in 9ºL drift and a track of 206º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 215º. This occurs at a heading of 224º with 6ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 88 kt. GS out: 035º 5. Note that this heading would result in 6ºR drift and a track of 041º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 035º. This occurs at a heading of 029º with 6ºR drift. 7.

These messages are released 72 hours in advance of planned maintenance. These messages are also used to notify users of unscheduled outages. General NANUs can be used to disseminate general GPS information. Outages come in two varieties: planned and unplanned. Planned are all the activities/events that have been scheduled and that could potentially have an impact on the Signal-in-Space (SiS) and/or the performance levels. Planned NAGUs aim to inform users about the activity/event with a reasonable advance notice, ahead of their occurrence. The planned outages, in space or ground segment, can potentially cause an outage of the broadcast satellite SiS. A planned outage will be announced ahead of time and usually means some sort of maintenance is taking place. Unplanned are all the activities/events that have an impact on the SiS and/or the performance levels that have not been scheduled and could not be foreseen in advance, before their occurrence. The aim of unplanned NAGUs is to inform users about the activity/event within a reasonable time, after their occurrence. The difference between the planned and unplanned outages of GPS is that a planned outage is well recognisable during flight preparation, because relevant monitoring tools and NOTAMs will most probably indicate some problems. On the other hand, in case of unplanned outage, it is possible that the pilot will become aware mid-flight that integrity is lost. Therefore, the pilot should develop and maintain good practise in using backup conventional navigation whenever possible.",

It will cover notifications of temporary information (usually of less than 90 days duration), or permanent information not yet included in the AIP. The NOTAM refers to the St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport (LSZR) in Switzerland. In Item E), the notification of the NOTAM is described using ICAO abbreviations. A decode of this is as follows: SBAS is unavailable for approaches to LPV minima. GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure they are available for the time of usage. Thus, it is important before flight to check that there will be enough satellites visible and any potential outages at all stages of the flight, but especially for the destination airfield and alternate. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. The source for Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) guidance is the GNSS, which can provide guidance to an unlimited number of aircraft at multiple locations. To enable use of LPV minima, the aircraft must be fitted with both an LPV capable FMS and a compatible SBAS receiver. LPV minima take advantage of the high accuracy guidance and increased integrity that an SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, etc.) provides. European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a type of Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) for Europe.",

RAIM functions by monitoring the real-time satellite signal strength and integrity in order to ensure reliable GNSS position tracking. RAIM alone gives current conditions and does not warn of planned outages. For predictions, you could use the AUGUR RAIM prediction tool, which would inform you of when the satellite signals would be inadequate for an accurate position fix over a certain area, however these prediction tools mainly focus on satellite geometry and whether or not there are a sufficient number of satellites. Temporary degradations in signal strength/availability caused by GNSS interference testing for example, are usually only stated in NOTAMs. These NOTAMs specify the areas and times where signal degradation may occur due to non-satellite-related factors. Since these disruptions are external and temporary, they won't be shown in RAIM predictions, which mostly assess satellite performance.",

The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station (which is generally an airport). The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently (but with the ability to carry out full auto-lands with appropriate legislation), and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The availability of GBAS augmentation depends solely on the airport in question, in this case, Malaga. They are the ones who run the GBAS receivers, ground station and VDB transmitter, and therefore will mark any planned unserviceabilities as NOTAMs. It is quite tempting to choose the AUGUR RAIM prediction as the correct answer, and this might give the pilot an idea as to how many satelllites should be available for the GNSS system, but this is not what is being asked in the question.",

Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 090º 5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 120 kt. GS out: 270º 5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 80 kt.

On your flight computer, on the \"AIRSPEED\" window, align 9000 ft with -13ºC. On the Inner ring, look for CAS 190 kt and read the corresponding TAS value of approx. 214 kt. (2) Now, that we know our TAS - we can calculate our GS using TAS and Wind: Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 320º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 214 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 40 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 170º 5. Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 165º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 170º. This occurs at a heading of 175º with 5ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 248 kt. GS out: 350º 5. Note that this heading would result in 7ºR drift and a track of 357º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 350º. This occurs at a heading of 343º with 5ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 178 kt. (3) We can now apply the formulas: Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home) Distance to PET = (248 x 350) / (178 + 248) Distance to PET = 203.8 NM Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out",

Following the rhyme \"Variation East, Magnetic Least\", the True Track from present position to OAL is: 053o(M) + 2oE = 055o(T). 2. Using your Flight/Navigation computer find the actual TAS: Rotate the inner dial until you see the \"Mach No. Index\" inside the airspeed correction window on the inner dial. Line up the OAT -35°C opposite to the \"Mach No. Index\". Reduded Mach number 0.76(76) on the inner scale, reads opposite TAS 456 kt. 3. Using again your Flight/Navigation computer find the Groundspeed: Set wind direction to 045º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 456 kt. Mark the wind velocity 65 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 055º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 2ºR drift and a track of 057º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 055º. This occurs at a heading of 053º with 1ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 395 kt. 4. The Revised flight time to OAL VOR/DME is given by the formula: Time = Direct Distance to OAL / Grounspeed = 90 NM / 395 KT = 0.23 hr or 13.8 min, rounded 14 min.

            "explanation": "Drift is the angle from heading to the actual track (track made good). It is called left (port) dirft, when the track made good is less than the heading and right (starboard), when the track is greater than the heading. Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angle difference from the aircraft’s actual track (track made good) to its planned heading. It is of equal amount with the drift, but with different sign. Statement 1: CORRECT With either the forecast wind 240°(T)/15 kt, or the actual wind 290°(T)/25 kt, the aircraft with a track of 276° (T) will experience a headwind componet in both cases. The headwind component because of the forecast wind is: 15 kt x cos (276° - 240°) = 12 kt. The headwind component because of the actual wind is: 25 kt x cos (290° - 276°) = 24 kt. Thus, the aircraft will actually experience a greater headwind component during the cruise phase, which will further decrease its Groundspeed and as a consequence its actual flight time will increase. Statement 2: INCORRECT Because of the forecast wind 240°(T)/15 kt, blowing from forward-left, the aircraft is expected to drift to the right. Thus, the WCA should be to the left. But, due to the actual wind 290°(T)/25 kt, blowing from forward-right, the aircraft finally drifts to the left. Thus, the WCA must be to the right. Therefore, the WCA must be altered from a value to the left to a value to the right.",

The financial and reputational costs of the passengers/cargo not being delivered at the desired destination. The preferred COMMERCIAL option is to land at the destination. According to SPO.

Option b) \"Hold for 17 minutes, and after that time if landing isn't possible, proceed to alternate using the alternate fuel remaining.\" This scenario requires the pilots to consume 7 minutes of final reserve fuel, as they are only carrying 10 minutes of extra fuel (for holding). Option a) \"Immediately divert to the destination alternate since there is NOT sufficient fuel to hold for the estimated 17 minutes, thereby having extra fuel when landing at the destination alternate.\" is incorrect because diverting immediately to the alternate is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves. Option d) \"Declare minimum fuel to ATC as that will guarantee priority and ATC will ensure that the aeroplane will only hold for the available time to land with alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel.\" is incorrect because declaring minimum fuel is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves.

The time and distance for a descent from FL050 to landing are 6 min and 18 NM respectively. To find the time and distance for a descent from FL310 to FL050, we must subtract the values of a descent from FL050 from a descent from FL310. Time and distance for a descent from FL310 to FL050: Time: 20 min - 6 min = 14 min Distance: 93 NM - 18 NM = 75 NM From this we can see that the ground distance is 75 NM and that this is the correct answer. The distances given in the table are air distances, however there is no wind mentioned in the question. It is assumed that there is no wind and so the air distance is equal to the ground distance.

The fuel on board is less than the final reserve fuel, so it’s very much likely that it won’t be enough to reach airport B. “Continue to airport A as scheduled.” Incorrect. I believe that this option implies that the aircraft will follow the flight plan routing, which in case of emergency, does not really apply. It is likely that the aircraft will get assistance from ATC and get shortcuts, for instance. “Continue to airport A since the weather is stable.” Correct. Stable weather will permit a landing.

Rotate the disk until wind direction 300o is under the True index. Mark wind velocity 25 kt below the centre dot. Rotate the disc until the course 267o is under the True index. The mark shows a Groundspeed 119 kt. Thus, the distance from Chiemsee Island to Seeshaupt at FL45 will be covered in: Sector distance / GS = 45 NM / 119 kt = 0.37 hr or 23 min. Therefore, the new ETA at Seeshaupt at FL45 will be: 08:36 (ATA at Chiemsee) + 23 min (Sector time Chiemsee to Seeshaupt) = 08:59.",

A performance database, which is updated only when rquired and is able to calculate maximum and optimum cruise altitudes, the optimum speeds for climb, cruise and descent and the required thrust settings for different phases of flight. The FMC has, also, the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival). In case the wind component is not as expected and input into the FMC, then it adjusts the speed so as to maintain the desired ETAs. Thus, in case the actual in-flight wind produces a greater headwind than the forecast wind input into the FMC, then speeds will be increased to maintain ETAs.",

The actual wind will also affect the direction in which the aircraft is traveling over the ground, known as the track. If the pilot maintains the same heading and true airspeed, the aircraft will drift off course due to the effect of the wind, resulting in a difference in the planned track. Fuel consumption is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the difference between the planned and actual wind, as it can be affected by other factors such as altitude, temperature, and engine performance. Furthemore, in this case, it is not possible to determine whether the wind will have a positive or negative impact on fuel consumption.

To calculate the revised ETA at WPT C, the Groundspeed at FL210 is required, through your Flight/Nav computer: Place the centre dot over TAS 196 kt. Rotate the disk until wind direction 190o is under the True index. Mark wind velocity 5 kt below the centre dot. Rotate the disc until the track 335o is under the True index. The mark shows a Groundspeed of 200 kt. Thus, the sector from WPT B to WPT C will be covered in: Sector Time = Sector distance / GS = 61 NM / 200 kt = 0.3 hr or 18 min. Therefore, the revised ETA at WPT C will be: 12:12 (ATA at WPT B) + 18 min = 12:30. Closest option: 12:28.",

When the environment is warmer than standard, the aircraft will be higher than indicated, usually a safe error. When the environment is colder than standard, the aircraft will be lower than indicated and this potentially a dangerous error. Temperature errors need to be taken into account when landing in very cold conditions. A temperature correction to the DH/DA or MDA/MDH and step-down fixes inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF) must be added in this case. According to ICAO-Doc 8168-Vol.1-Flight Procedures-Part 1-Section 4-Ch. 1: The flight crew is responsible for any necessary Temperature Error Correction to all all published minimum altitudes/heights including the altitudes/heights for the initial and intermediate segments; the DA/DH and subsequent missed approach altitudes/heights except for APV/BARO-VNAV approach procedures. NOTE: The pilot is not responsible for temperature error corrections, when being radar vectored by ATC or when issued a direct routing. But this does not relieve the pilot of the responsibilty that any clearances issued by ATC are safe.",
