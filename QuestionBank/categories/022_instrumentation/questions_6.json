The required visual reference for a manual landing is elements of the approach light system, threshold, threshold markings, threshold identification lights, visual glideslope indicator (PAPI), touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights and runway edge lights. The issue with this question is that typically in a large transport aircraft, ‘FLARE’ mode would engage at around 30/50 ft radio altitude. The time delay between 30/50 ft RA and touchdown is around 2 seconds. So, for the pilot monitoring to call “NO FLARE” and the pilot flying to take manual control and land at this late stage is basically impossible. Should the ‘FLARE’ mode not activate, the likely scenario would be for the aircraft to continue to descend and autoland onto the runway with a rate of descent of approximately 700 fpm. A firm but likely safe landing would arise. Alternatively, the pilot flying may wish to execute a go around/baulked landing manoeuvrer. Note: You may wish to consider appealing the question, depending on the wording in your actual exam. Alternatively consider that the remaining ‘incorrect’ options suggest taking manual control after the landing, which by then is too late.",

If below the alert height all autopilots disengage, the ILS signal is lost, excessive ILS deviations occur, or the radio-altimeter fails, a warning will be triggered and an autoland procedure will not be possible.",

The decision height is the height on the approach at which the pilot must see the required visual reference to continue to land. The visual reference is basically either the physical runway, its markings (paint) or an element of the approach lighting. In real life, it will be the lights that will shine to find you first. If the required visual reference can not be established at DH, then a Go-Around will result. However, the Go-Around mode can be selected above DH if needed and infact even once landed. For example, on the B737 the mode remains available up to 2 seconds after touch down. Note: Go-Around basically tells the autopilot to pitch up with wings level and the autothrust to select a high thrust setting for climb out. The pilot must retract the gear and flaps as practical.",

Let’s see an example. If an aircraft flying with the autopilot ON is cruising and suddenly a gust makes it to climb, the rate gyros of the IRS will detect this displacement. The gyros will then send a signal to a detector (=signal processor) that is proportional to the rate of change of attitude. The detector that has received this signal will compute a corrective signal and will send it to the elevator servo motors. After the elevator has been moved, feedback of the elevator position is sent to the detector so that the actual position of the elevator and the required one is compared. If the elevator still hasn’t achieved its required position, the detector unit will compute another corrective signal proportional to the new displacement. This feedback operation will continue until the elevator hasn’t achieved the required position.",

The alert height defines the point during an approach with the lowest minima (CAT IIIB): - Before which (above AH) a go-around (or full manual take-over) should be decided and initiated if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system (the probability of a second failure remains high and must be considered); - After which (below AH), if a single failure affects the fail-operational landing system, the approach and autoland can be continued (the probability of a second failure is negligible). FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

However, when a failure occurs below the alert height, the approach should typically continue as planned with an automatic landing. The only circumstance that would trigger a go-around below the alert height is the activation of the \"autoland warning light.\" This light indicates the system's absolute inability to complete the automatic landing and can be caused by factors such as dual autopilot failure, loss of ILS (Instrument Landing System) localizer and/or glide slope signals, excessive deviations from the ILS beams, or failure of a radio altimeter with significant deviations between radio altimeter readings from both sides. CS-AWO - All Weather Operations CS-AWO 300 Applicability and Terminology (6) The alert height is a specified radio height, based on the characteristics of the aeroplane and its fail-operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aeroplane (including, where appropriate, ground roll guidance and the reversionary mode in a hybrid system), the approach would be discontinued and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored and the approach continued.",

AUTOPILOT CONDITIONS OF ENGAGEMENT Before the autopilot can be engaged, certain conditions must be met. These conditions vary with aircraft type. The sequence of events when a mode is engaged and the different phases are as follows: - initial phase: where attitude is changed to obtain a new trajectory in order to achieve the new parameter; the trajectory will be based on rate of closure which is again based on the difference between the original parameter and the new parameter; - capture phase: where the aircraft will follow a predefined rate of change of trajectory to achieve the new parameter without overshooting/undershooting; - tracking or hold phase: where the aircraft will maintain the set parameter until a new change has been initiated.",

Movement of the roll command bar to the left or right requires rolling the aeroplane to the left or right, in order to centre the command bar, and to satisfy the computed command. When centred, the command bar indicates the achievement of the required roll attitude. The simplest nav mode is to have the aircraft keep flying in the direction you select. This is called Heading Mode. In this mode the pilot selects a desired heading, either using a knob on the HSI, using the central FDS/autopilot panel or on the MCP.

Before coupling an autopilot with the aircraft’s control system the integrity of the Autopilot Inner Loop must be established to ensure that it may safely take control of the aircraft. AUTOPILOT CONDITIONS OF ENGAGEMENT - INTERLOCKS (figure 2) Before an autopilot can safely engage with the flight controls, certain conditions must be fulfilled. These conditions vary slightly between autopilots, but take the form of a number of switches called interlocks, connected in series. A list of some of the conditions that must be operative before the interlocks allow autopilot engagement is as follows: - AC and DC power supplies in tolerance - Trimmed and erected gyroscopes - Yaw damper system engaged - Automatic pitch trim system available - Mach trim system available - Do not press instinctive Cut-Out (Disengage buttons) - Operative CADC - Stabilizer Trim Autopilot Cut-out Switch is at NORMAL. - Manual controls in their neutral position (i.e. Control wheel and column, turn knob, pitch switch). Only after enabling all the interlocks, can the system engage.",

Pilot Induced Oscillation events include a broad set of undesirable, and sometimes hazardous, phenomena that are associated with less than ideal interactions between pilots and aircraft. Pilot Induced Oscillations are sustained or uncontrollable oscillations resulting from efforts of the pilot to control the aircraft and occur when the pilot of an aircraft inadvertently commands an often increasing series of corrections in opposite directions; each one is an attempt to control the aircraft's reaction to the previous input with an overcorrection in the opposite direction. By definition, PIO (or APC) cannot happen unless the pilot is making inputs that are sustaining the oscillation. Consequently, the first and most critical step for exiting PIO is to get out of the loop. This presents three primary possibilities: - The pilot freezes the controls - The pilot releases the controls - The pilot significantly reduces the aggressiveness of control input",

The term \"servomechanism\" (sometimes shortened to \"servo\") could be defined as: An automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the performance of a mechanism and is defined by its function. In other words, a servo-system operates on the principle of using a some sort of detection device to automatically monitor the state of a particular system or a component (parameters, position, etc.). Any difference between the detected values and desired values is treated as an error condition. In such cases the difference value (error signal) is amplified and then used by the corrective mechanism (e.g. an electric motor) to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error. Servos are frequently used in the position control systems. They are typically electrical or partially electronic in nature, using an electric motor as the primary means of creating the mechanical corrective force. Other types of servos use hydraulics, pneumatics, or magnetic principles. In aircraft systems, we can usually find servo-mechanisms in the autopilot systems (e.g. position control of the respective flight control surfaces), instruments (e.g. maintaining the vertical of a gyroscope), etc. Note: if you still have difficulties grasping the understanding of the principle behind a \"servo\" then let's take a look at two common car systems: • Electrically Controlled Car Windows: When you press the button to move the car window up or down, an electric motor is operated to move the actual window pane. Is this another example of a servo-system? No, because the action (e.g. motor opening the window) was based on a manual user input => you had to press the \"open\" button to get that window down. • Car Cruise Control System: You are driving down the highway and you set your cruise control at 130 km/h (desired state). The highway starts to go uphill suddenly and your cruise control system immediately detects the speed starting to decrease (detection mechanism). In other words, an error occurred - there is a difference between the desired and actually detected states. The system, therefore, applies a force to eliminate this error => the cruise control system adds more gas to compensate for the uphill terrain and brings the speed back up to the preselected usually so quickly the driver doesn't even notice any speed drop. Is this an example of a servo system? Of course, it is - we have an automatic error detection + error correction.",

Each of them has a different area of responsibility in the cockpit. The Pilot Flying (PF) must concentrate on \"flying the aircraft\" to monitor and control the pitch attitude, bank angle, airspeed, thrust, sideslip, heading, etc., in order to achieve and maintain the desired targets, vertical flight path, and lateral flight path. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) must assist the PF and must actively monitor flight parameters, call out any excessive deviation and is responsible for radio communication with ATC, flight attendants, and passengers. Furthermore, he/she maintains the flight plan, monitors fuel, reads checklists, and operates the landing gear and flaps. Therefore, both flight crewmembers must: • Focus and concentrate on their tasks to ensure appropriate task sharing • Maintain situational awareness and immediately resolve any uncertainty as a crew.",

Fail passive - The automatic landing system is fed by only two fail-safe autopilots comparing their computations, therefore it cannot determine which one of the units is delivering the correct steering commands. In the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system. Therefore, looking at each option: \"maintain safe flight, but is unable to complete the automatic landing.\" Correct. Whilst the \"maintain safe flight\" is debatable, as the autopilot will eventually disconnect to allow the pilots to perform the landing manually or make a go-around, the fail passive system makes sure that there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, which you could consider to mean that it is safe flight, and the aircraft is not able to complete the autoland after such a problem. It is therefore most correct. \"complete the automatic landing, including the landing roll-out to a full stop.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system. \"maintain safe flight, providing the autoland capability but without auto-flare.\" The autoland capability doesn't exist without auto-flare, and the autoland capability is gone when a fail-passive system has a failure of some kind. \"complete the automatic landing, but unable to provide roll-out guidance.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system.",

This is the third similar question about this topic we have in our database, and all appear to have quite significantly different options at least. Failure or malfunctions of any of the systems required to perform an automatic landing can result in a degradation of autoland performance. Additionally, systems which are not directly involved in the autoland sequency can also affect the ability to perform automatic landing and sometimes result in higher minima. Thus, the pilot must check the relevant manuals, such as the FCOM, QRH or MEL to verify whether the failure has any impact on the aircraft's approach capability. In case the defect causes a reduction in the aircraft's approach capability, a diversion or higher decision height and/or RVR might be necessary. Whilst I have never personally seen an aircraft or company procedure that requires windshield heating to be available for autoland, there are often requirements for windshield wipers to be operative, etc., as visual reference can be very important in the late stages of the approach and the landing. To go through each option: \"Yes, because the windshield heating system is not essential for the autoland procedure.\" This is not necessarily always the case, and we cannot just assume that the windshield heating system is not a part of the required equipment. \"No, because autoland requires all aircraft systems to be fully operational.\" Not always; the autoland has a certain amount of required equipment, but not everything is necessary. The specific requirements will be laid out in the company or aircraft manuals. \"Yes, as long as the weather conditions are clear, and there is no need for visibility enhancement.\" Well the whole point of an autoland is an automatically flown approach and landing in poor visibility, so the weather conditions are not clear. \"No, unless approved by the airline's manuals and the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures are followed.\" Correct (mostly). We have to assume \"no\" until we find the list of required equipment for the autoland in the manuals, or reference documents such as the QRH for any restrictions caused by the loss of windshield heating. After checking these, only then can we perform the autoland if we are happy that it is allowed with such a defect. MEL procedures need not be followed as the problem has been found in the air, and MEL is a document used to check requirements before dispatch. Nonetheless, this is the most correct answer.",

The vertical bar is always associated with the roll channel. The horizontal command bar of the FD supplies information about the direction and magnitude of the corrections to be applied to the pitch angle of the aircraft. The horizontal bar is always associated with the pitch channel. When tracking the glideslope, the command bars will indicate at which angle you should pitch and bank the aircraft in order to get back on the glideslope. In other words, it will indicate the correction to be applied to the pitch and bank angle in order to capture and then readapt this pitch and bank angle so that you follow the glideslope.",

The Fail-Operational Automatic Landing System A fail-operational automatic landing system is defined as the capability of a system to withstand a failure without affecting the overall functioning of the system and without causing degradation of performance beyond the limits required for an automatic landing. The system requires a minimum of three autopilots. Alert Height The alert height is a specified radio altimeter height, based on the characteristics of the aircraft and its fail operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aircraft, the approach would be discontinued, and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored, and the approach would be continued to complete the autoland. If below the alert height all autopilots disengage, the ILS signal or components are lost, excessive ILS deviations occur, or the radio-altimeter fails, a warning will be triggered and an autoland procedure will not be possible. Fail passive - The automatic landing system is fed by only two fail-safe autopilots comparing their computations, therefore it cannot determine which one of the units is delivering the correct steering commands. In the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system.",

The corresponding A/THR mode is SPEED or MACH. The V/S (FPA) guidance has priority over the speed guidance. If the selected target V/S or FPA is too high (relative to the current thrust condition and speed), the FMGC will steer the aircraft to the target V/S or FPA, but the aircraft will also accelerate or decelerate. VERTICAL SPEED An aircraft's vertical speed is the positive or negative rate of altitude change with respect to time. This is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE (figure 2) The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon).

In other words, it off-loads any steady state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

In other words, it off-loads any steady state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto-synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

            "explanation": "Dutch roll can only occur in aircraft with swept wings, and within the compressible altitude and speed range. Such aircraft are known as having dynamic instability. It actually starts with a yawing motion at a rate that is characteristic for every affected aircraft type and is referred to as the Dutch roll frequency. The advancing wing creates more lift than the retreating one and this causes the aircraft to roll to the side of the yawing motion. As a result, this roll induces further yaw to the opposite side, larger than the initial yaw angle, causing a larger roll, which results in an increased adverse yaw effect, and so on. These aircraft must feature a yaw damper system in order to counteract this Dutch roll tendency. Yaw damper systems feature rate gyroscopes in the horizontal axis, and sometimes accelerometers, to determine the rate of any aircraft yaw. It uses this data along with the CAS to cause a deflection of the rudder that stops the yawing motion before the aircraft starts to roll. Yawing motions act around the aircraft’s normal axis, therefore only a rate gyro in the horizontal plane would be able to detect this left/right movement of the airframe when viewed from above. An Inertial Reference System (IRS) installed on larger transport aircraft typically feature 3 rate gyros, each in one of the 3 axis centred around the aircraft centre of gravity; normal, longitudinal and lateral axis. As a result, the IRS could be a source of yawing data for the yaw damper system, depending on the aircraft type.",

Fly-By-Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a fully powered flight control system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. Advantages of Fly-By-Wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Auto-trim will continuously change the \"zero point\" of the flight control system, and therefore needs no input from the pilot usually, reducing workload. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure G forces out of the limits. Auto-trim will continuously change the \"zero point\" of the flight control system, and therefore needs no input from the pilot usually, reducing workload. It operates within the usual flight envelope as an integral part of the Fly-By-Wire system, and operates just fine with flaps/slats extended or retracted.",

On the other hand, minimum speed reversion plays a crucial role in ensuring that the aircraft remains above the minimum speed required for maintaining safe flight conditions. In this case, the auto-throttle system automatically responds by increasing engine power or retracting drag-inducing components like flaps and landing gear.

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL Dutch roll is caused by the interplay between lateral stability around the longitudinal axis (roll) and longitudinal stability around the vertical axis (yaw) of an aircraft in flight. An aircraft with an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be susceptible to Dutch roll. YAW DAMPER To produce an aircraft that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes, a system to automatically counter Dutch roll must be installed. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system is called yaw damper. The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the third axis of autopilot control. The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn co-ordination, runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust. A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. DUTCH ROLL FILTER The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a yaw and act in opposition to produce an unco-ordinated turn. So the yaw damper system needs to be able to distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll. The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

The Overspeed protection will inhibit the nose down pitch trim orders to prevent the aircraft from pitching further down in case it is over speeding because of a trim runaway. Some aircraft such as the Airbus, will even automatically pitch up to lose some speed, once the aircraft reaches a certain threshold.

It is different from the stick pusher that actively pushes the control column down to reduce the pitch angle and help prevent the aircraft from exceeding further the angle of attack.

Trimmers can runaway if they are electrically controlled and either have a malfunction, or if the engaged autopilot system has a malfunction and sends such a demand to the trim system. They can also runaway if the pilot switches become stuck, hence the need for a double pole switch to reduce that chance. Nonetheless, pilots must be aware of the dangers of trim runaway and ready to fix the issue, which usually includes the following actions: Disconnecting the autopilot and authrottle, if engaged. This may come with a large force change on the flight controls if the autopilot was masking a large out of trim position, so the pilots must hold the controls very firmly, and this out of trim condition may even require the force of both pilots at times to remain controlled. Switch off the electric trimmers. There is usually an electric trim cutout switch (or multiple) in the flight deck which removes the power to the trimmers. If the trimmers subsequently do not stop then the pilot monitoring may need to grasp the spinning trim wheel to stop a further runaway in some aircraft types. Manually fly the aircraft and manually manipulate the trim wheels. These may be quite heavy in large aircraft so may even require both pilots to manipulate the controls or trimmer.",

Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus A320 (the Fly-By-Wire aircraft most often referenced by EASA), the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, fly by wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, Their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, Alpha prot. = the aircraft pitch is set so that speed remains at or above this speed, unless the stick is manually pulled back, hence it will automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed if necessary Alpha floor = automatically applies TOGA thrust Alpha max = In normal law, this cannot be exceeded even by maximum stick deflection aft, to avoid a full stall. There is no stick shaker or stick pusher on fly-by-wire aircraft with side-sticks. The system would not revert to direct law as this removes all high alpha protections.",

            "explanation": "Mach trim is used to trim the aircraft at high Mach numbers (e.g. B737 from Mach.615). It prevents instability and tuck under (which appears above MCRIT) due to an increased pitch down moment, which is caused the following reasons: CP moves aft shock waves at the wing root reduced effectiveness of the tailplane Mach trim counteracts (increases pitch up) by one of the following: adjusting stabilizer adjusting elevator trim tank (fuel pumped to the tail) Outcome: stick force gradient will be maintained longitudinal stability will be increased tuck under will be avoided Mach Trim System relates to the pitch channel of the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS). It is designed as an AFCS sub-system and is therefore, like the yaw damper, operational irrespective of whether or not the AFCS is active (autopilot engaged or disengaged). The heart of the Mach trim system is the coupler unit. This receives signals, corresponding to Mach number, from the Air Data Computer (ADC). Whenever these signals exceed the pre-set value (for the aeroplane type) the trim coupler unit releases the brake and the speed signal from the ADC is fed to the motor. This causes the stabiliser to move in such a way that the elevators are driven upward, counteracting any tendency to a \"Mach Tuck-under\". Internal monitoring of the system provides a failure warning in the form of the illumination of a fail indicator light. Although connected to the pitch channel the system is totally independent of the pitch control channel of the AFCS. In other words, the Mach trim system provides speed stability at higher Mach numbers. It operates (adjusts the elevators with respect to the stabilizer as speed increases) only above certain minimum Mach number - for example on a B737-300 it is above Mach 0.615. With the Mach trim system INOP the maximum speed of the aircraft is typically limited to a lower Mach number than normally. \"Tuck-under\" is the phenomena encountered by aeroplanes flying at high subsonic, transonic or supersonic speeds. In these speed regimes there is typically a significant rearward movement of the Centre of Pressure (CP). In order to prevent this becoming an uncontrollable \"nose-down\" pitching motion, it is necessary to provide some form of compensation. This is done by the use of a Mach Trim System. Or otherwise said the Mach trim system allows to increase the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft by changing the horizontal stabilizer according to the Mach number.",

Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes.

An aircraft with an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be susceptible to Dutch roll. YAW DAMPER To produce an aircraft that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes, a system to automatically counter Dutch roll must be installed. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system is called yaw damper. The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the third axis of autopilot control. The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn coordination, runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust. A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. DUTCH ROLL FILTER The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a yaw and act in opposition to produce an uncoordinated turn. So the yaw damper system needs to be able to distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll. The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

Cruise / ALT hold IAS / MACH hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. On a large commercial aircraft, the auto-throttle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS / Mach number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS / Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the time it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED / MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

Climb N1 hold auto-throttle commands full thrust for climb and the desired speed is maintained by the AP pitch channel. Climb with V/S IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Cruise / ALT hold IAS/MACH hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. On a large commercial aircraft, the auto-throttle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the times it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

Different aircraft manufacturers have varying names for their auto-thrust modes but they are still categorised as a speed or thrust modes. A SPEED mode is automatically selected when an autopilot flight director system (AFDS) vertical mode is controlling the aircrafts trajectory. In the cruise with ALT HOLD engaged the pitch channel will be maintaining the altitude so the IAS/Mach No will be maintained by the auto-thrust. To achieve this the autothrust has to vary the amount of thrust to maintain the airspeed. A THRUST mode is automatically commanded when the engaged AFDS vertical mode is controlling the airspeed. In a descent the airspeed is controlled by pitch and the auto-thrust sets and maintains idle thrust. A Thrust Mode will always set and maintain a specific thrust setting as opposed to the variable thrust used when in a speed mode The first figure shows a Boeing 737 Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) in the cruise with MCP SPD annunciated in the autothrust column. Speed is being maintained by the autothrust at the figure set on the pilots mode control panel (MCP) illustated by the purple bug on the ASI. This is a speed mode The second figure shows the aircraft in a descent, RETARD is annunciated in the autothrust column because the thrust has been retarded and is being maintained at idle. Speed is being controlled by pitch which is why MCP SPD is annunciated in the vertical mode column. This is a thrust mode.",

If the autothrottle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the autothrottle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator.",

Short answer, as per the flight manual: Minimum Speed Reversion - If actual speed becomes equal to or sightly less than the minimum speed, the underspend symbol appears in the MCP/IAS/Mach display. - The AFS commands a speed 5 knots greater than minimum speed. - Selecting a speed 15 knots greater than minimum speed reactivates MCP speed selection control.",

Only one FMGC controls the active A/THR, it is called the master FMGC. Thrust is controlled: ‐ Automatically when the A/THR is active ‐ Manually by the flight crew. The autothrust system, when active: ‐ Maintains a specific thrust in THRUST mode ‐ Controls the aircraft speed or Mach in SPEED/MACH mode ‐ Uses ALPHA FLOOR mode to set maximum thrust when the aircraft angle of attack exceeds a specific threshold. Autothrust Modes In THRUST mode, autothrust commands a specific thrust level in conjunction with the AP/FD pitch mode. This thrust level is limited by thrust lever position. THR MCT: Single engine thrust in climb. The live engine is at maximum continuous thrust (thrust lever in MCT detent) THR CLB: Climb thrust in two engine configurations (at least one thrust lever in the CL detent, the other one below CL) THR LVR: Undetermined thrust (neither CLB nor MCT thrust) THR IDLE: Minimum thrust (both engines at IDLE thrust) MAN TOGA: A/THR is armed, at least one thrust lever is in TOGA detent (and the associated engine is running). When the A/THR is armed for takeoff or go-around, the FMA displays “MAN TOGA” or “MAN FLX” in white to remind the flight crew that the thrust levers are properly positioned. Note: N1 is an Autothrottle mode in aircraft like Boeing 737. In this mode, the autothrottle maintains thrust at the selected N1 limit displayed on the thrust mode display, including full go-around N1 limit.",

In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the time it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).

Airspeed indications/trend vectors may give an indication of appropriate thrust adjustments but any reaction should not be too aggressive. Boeing 737 FCOM - Severe turbulence recommendations: Selection of the autopilot Control Wheel Steering (CWS) is recommended for operation in severe turbulence. Do not use Altitude Hold (ALT HLD) mode. The recommended procedures for flight in severe turbulence are: Airspeed - Target airspeed should be approximately 280 KIAS or 0.76 MACH, whichever is lower during climb or descent. If below 15 000 ft and the airplane gross weight is less than the maximum landing weight, the airplane may be slowed to 250 knots in the clean configuration during the descent. If in cruise, set turbulence penetration N1 as highlighted by TURB N1 on the Cruise page. Severe Turbulence will cause large and often rapid variations in indicated airspeed. Do not chase the airspeed. FMC N1 LIMIT page - Verify/Select CON Yaw Damper - Engaged Autopilot - Optional - If the autopilot is engaged, use CWS position, do not use ALT HLD mode Autothrottle - Disengage Attitude - Maintain wings level and the desired pitch attitude. Use the attitude indicator as the primary instrument. In extreme drafts, large attitude changes may occur. Do not use sudden large control inputs. After establishing the trim setting for penetration speed, do not change stabilizer trim Altitude - Allow the altitude to vary. Large altitude variations are possible in severe turbulence. Sacrifice altitude in order to maintain the desired attitude and airspeed. Do not chase the altitude. Thrust - Engine ignition should be on. Position the Engine Start switches to FLT. Make an initial thrust setting for the target airspeed. Change thrust only in case of extreme airspeed variation. The FMC cruise page displays N1 target value for turbulence.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

            "explanation": "The gyromagnetic compass is the combination of a simple compass and a gyroscope. The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate.

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

HORIZONTAL COMPONENT The horizontal component (H) of the earth’s field is known as the directive force and it is the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian (providing a directional reference). Near the magnetic poles, the vertical component becomes much greater than at lower latitudes where the horizontal component dominates. This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted. Therefore, the deviation is West.",

A compass is marked in degrees from 000 to 359 in a clockwise direction starting from North. Therefore, regardless of your heading, any turn to the left will result in a decrease in your heading in degrees. For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

Initially, the pendulous magnet inside your compass will still remain aligned with the magnetic North of the Earth. However, as you increase the bank angle even more, the dip, which is the angle between the horizontal plane and your magnet, will get increasingly higher. At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator. Nothern Hemisphere: HDG 090 -> right steep turn -> (dip + bank angle > 90) -> 180 error HDG 270 -> left steep turn -> (dip + bank angle > 90) -> 180 error",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

In this mode, the system furnishes an inertial heading reference, with corrections introduced manually to offset earth rate and other errors. Note: The question text has not been verified.

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

            "explanation": "When accelerating in level flight, you would expect the artificial horizon (AH) to show wings level and a steady nose attitude. However, due to its construction, both the electrical and air driven AH will show a false attitude. This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems. The electrical AH will show a false climb. The air driven AH will show a false climb and a right turn. This question appears to be asking about an air driven version. The air-driven artificial horizon gives the pilot the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon and is part of the essential set of instruments in any aircraft. It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement. Note: Both AH show a false nose up when accelerating, as seen in many other questions. The 2021 Learning Objectives focus more on the effect of acceleration, rather than the cause. That said, the electrical AH uses mercury switches to maintain the gyro axis vertical. In normal operation, the mercury sits at the bottom of the switch and the circuit is open. During an acceleration, the mercury is pushed out of position and closes the switch, ultimately driving the gyro to show a false climb. An air driven AH uses a pendulous unit and vanes to maintain the gyro axis vertical. During an acceleration, the force acts to disturb both the pendulous unit and the vanes, and this results in a false right climb indication.",

If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The main direction indication of the system comes from a directional gyroscope, which is kept from drifting by tying it to the output of a flux valve unit for magnetic reference. This happens when “slave” is selected on the “free/slave” switch. Alternative Explanation: The Gyro-Magnetic Compass (GMC) system has two operational modes: \"SLAVE\" mode: used when magnetic heading references are reliable. It is the normal magnetically-monitored mode. In this mode, the directional gyro is connected to the magnetic flux detector, which provides a stable magnetic reference to counteract the gyro's apparent drift. \"FREE\" mode (Directional gyro): used when magnetic heading references are not reliable, such as in polar regions. In this mode, the system supplies an inertial heading reference, and the pilot manually introduces corrections to compensate for earth rate and other errors. If the switch is changed to \"FREE\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

A DGI uses a two degrees of freedom gyro with a horizontally mounted axis, while the artificial horizon uses an Earth tied gyro with a vertical axis and 2 degrees of freedom. The rate of turn indicator consists of a rate gyro with its spin axis mounted along the lateral axis of the aircraft. It has only one gimbal, providing the turn indicator’s rate gyro only one degree of freedom. This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument. A reverse gearing system transmits the movement of the gimbal to a pointer which indicates the rate of turn over a rate of turn calibrated scale. The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system. Here are the main properties of the gyroscopic instruments you need to know: Instrument Degrees of freedom Spin axis Directional gyro 2 horizontal Artificial horizon 2 vertical Rate of turn indicator 1 horizontal",

It is caused by the inertia of the spinning mass. The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis. Gyros are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. Despite the property of rigidity, the orientation of a gyro axis may alter over time. Any departure of a gyro axis from its original orientation is called wander. Wander may be either real or apparent (the difference is explained below) or a combination of both. Wander is subdivided into drift and topple. If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. (figure 1) If the gyro axis wanders in the vertical plane, it is called topple, either real or apparent.

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

The instrument consists of a needle that indicates the rate of turn and a ball that indicates the slip or skid of the aircraft. If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

Gravity erection is essential for the operation of an artificial horizon. However, accelerations occur during flight which cannot be distinguished from gravitational accelerations, induce indication errors. The erection system therefore tries to align the gyro axis with the apparent vertical. During acceleration, the erection system is unable to distinguish between acceleration caused by gravity (in the direction of the local vertical) and the inertia of its sensor. As a result, the apparent vertical is inclined to the rear (spin axis is displaced from the vertical) and causes a higher pitch indication. In simple words, the horizon bar moves down, indicating a climb. Deceleration causes the apparent vertical to tilt forwards, reducing the perceived pitch attitude.",

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes. Additionally, some more sophisticated artificial horizons are electrically driven and maintain the rotor’s axis vertical by using two mercury level switches and two torque motors.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This implies that the angle of bank should be correct for the TAS and rate of turn. The slip indicator gives a direct indication of the state of balance of the turn. This comprises a solid ball in a curved tube containing liquid with damps out the unwanted oscillations. The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube acting as the effective point of suspension. Operating Principles Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W (figure 1). The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of curvature of the tube. If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines etched on the tube. Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left (figure 2). The aircraft with lift L equal and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being proportional to TAS and rate of turn. The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal force C.",

APPARENT WANDER In this type of wander, the gyro spin axis does not physically wander away from its pre-set direction, but to an observer it appears to have changed its direction. This is because the gyro maintains its direction with respect to a fixed point in space, whereas the observer rotates with the Earth, thus with the passage of time the gyro appears to have changed direction, with reference to an Earth datum. Apparent wander, is also made up of horizontal components called drift, and vertical components called topple. The rate of drift and topple depends upon the latitude and can vary from zero to a maximum of 15.04° per hour (the rate at which the Earth rotates).",

If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. REAL WANDER In real wander, the axis of the gyro moves with respect to inertial space. This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, and an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

A typical mechanical ADI is based on an electric or vacuum-driven gyroscope. It provides numerous useful data relative to the flight path of the aircraft (pitch and roll) and integrates the Flight Directors of the AP/FD system. Besides, it can also integrate additional guidance features such as the localizer and glideslope of an ILS. Altitude and airspeed are usually not part of the ADI, although on modern EFIS displays they’re collocated and are very close to the ADI. This allows the pilots to establish an efficient scanning technique, essential when flying IFR.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

These are therefore “rate” gyros, using precession to measure the movement about a single axis, usually against a spring. Gyro A – The spin axis is horizontal (pitch axis), and the gyro can move about the roll axis. Since there’s no degree of freedom around the yaw axis, it is a yaw gyro. This is the exact setup of a turn indicator. Gyro B – The spin axis is vertical (yaw axis), and the gyro can move about the pitch axis. Since there’s no degree of freedom around the roll axis, it is a roll gyro. Gyro C – The spin axis also vertical (yaw axis), but the gyro cannot move about the pitch axis, only about the roll axis.

It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, for example, during a take-off run, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement.",

TAS exhibits an inverse relationship with the rate of turn, but it is directly proportional to the radius of the turn due to the increase in inertia and momentum of the aircraft with an increase in TAS. You can quickly compute the necessary bank angle for a standard 3° per second turn using the formula: Angle of bank = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7 For instance, for TAS values of 100 knots and 150 knots: Angle of bank for 100 knots = (100 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 17° Angle of bank for 150 knots = (150 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 22° This comparison reveals that as speed increases, so does the required bank angle to maintain the standard rate of turn, indicating a proportional relationship with TAS.",

The simplest form of gyroscope (or gyro) consists of a rapidly spinning disc (called a rotor). The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis. Gyros have its mass evenly distributed around its spin axis and are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. In order for a gyro to be able to maintain a fixed direction, it must be attached to the airframe in such a way that the aircraft has freedom to manoeuvre without disturbing the orientation of the gyro. This is achieved by using suspension devices which allow this freedom. These are called gimbals. Gyros may have one or two gimbals.",

            "explanation": "AIR DRIVEN ARTIFICIAL HORIZON (figure 1) In a gyroscopic attitude indicator system, the rotor assembly is made very slightly bottom-heavy in order to keep down the time taken for initial erection when the gyro is first started up, but a complex control system is required to maintain the rotor axis vertical in flight. The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous vanes at the base of the rotor housing, so that when the rotor axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane. Because the four jets are of equal strength but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - the gyro rotor remaining vertical. The opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as two pairs. The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted airflow, while the opposite slot is completely obstructed by its vane. The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. ACCELERATION ERROR (figure 2) The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose- up, right wing down, or climbing right hand turn indication will result. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot. This results in a reaction which acts to port. By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction of application of the Reaction had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise). The gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the pilot. This movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication. Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during acceleration. This force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical. This rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing down indication.",

INSs can be considered to be stand-alone, whereas IRSs are integrated with the FMS. The wording of these options seems to be almost intentionally difficult to understand. To start, we need to realise that EASA are referring to a stabilised platform INS when they call something an inertial navigation system, as per the above learning objective. These are systems that, once aligned, have a platform that remains level and pointing towards the North, which is controlled by rate-integrating gyros and servo motors to keep the platform in that orientation. By inputting the initial location when the INS is aligned and kept still, the system can then track every acceleration in the North/South and East/West axis to keep a track of speed and therefore distance travelled along those axes. Therefore, there is still a reference for this system, the North direction and which way is up. The platform then endeavours to maintain these references during flight. More modern systems using the same idea are called strapdown IRSs. They are much smaller and cheaper, and are fixed to the aircraft structure, measuring the accelerations and rotations of the aircraft and applying them in a computer model of the Earth to provide an improved version of an INS.",

An Inertial Navigation System is based on the measurement of acceleration in a known direction, or along a sensitive (input axis), which is detected and measured by an accelerometer. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. To keep this reference valid, the accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres.",

Accelerations in the East/West and North/South directions are measured by the accelerometers and are integrated. Acceleration integrated over time: Once = change in velocity. Twice = change in position. It is also true if we state that integrating velocity once over time gives the change in position. Internally, this is calculated by integrators that are time multiplication devices. Initially, acceleration is supplied to the integrator as a value in ft/sec². Multiplying a value in ft/sec² by another value in sec will give you a result in ft/sec => velocity. Velocity is basically how fast has the aircraft moved in feet per second. Then, this value is sent to another integrator to derive the change in position and determine the current position of the aircraft. In other words, a value in ft/sec is multiplied again by a value in seconds, which will result in a value in feet or NM => distance. The second integration will provide the IRS with the distance traveled, but if the initial position AND speed are known as well, the IRS will output the instantaneous position. Summary table of the integration process of the INS and the required inputs: Integrate with time. How many times? Additional Input(s) Output ACCELERATION Once Initial SPEED Instantaneous SPEED ACCELERATION Once ----- Change in SPEED (velocity) ACCELERATION TWICE Initial POSITION + Initial SPEED Instantaneous POSITION ACCELERATION TWICE ----- POSITION SPEED ONCE ----- DISTANCE traveled",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

When stationary the only output from the accelerometers will be due to gravity. During alignment the platform is driven by torque motors until no acceleration is sensed and is therefore level. Once level the platform has to be 'gyrocompassed' to align it with True North. This is acheived by monitoring the output of the gyros to sense topple caused by Earth rotation, the time taken to do this increases with latitude. For these reasons alignment can only be acheived if the aircraft is stationary. Moving an aircraft during alignment will require the process to start again when stationary and it could take as long as 15 - 20 minutes before alignment is complete. Pilots should always wait until INS alignment is complete before moving the aircraft",

The question is asking how these unbounded errors are affecting the system over time since they are the only cumulative errors. In fact, they increase proportionally with time, which means that the error increases as ‘t’ increases. Bounded errors are usually the following: Initial misalignment may not be conducted 100% correctly (aircraft shaking due to ground equipment positioning, crew activity, etc.) There can always be some errors due to the initial misalignment. Accelerators are mechanical systems consisting of a pendulous mechanism, pickoffs and servos that suffer all from the standard instrument error (manufacturing imperfections). Integrators make errors in the first stage of integration due to the incorrect inputs provided (listed in the points above). Unbounded errors are usually the following: Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. Drift of the gyroscopes of the platform, which are the main source of error.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. This system is composed of a stable platform consisting of high quality gyros and accelerometers and a computer. The purpose of the computer is to integrate the accelerometer outputs with time to give velocity and then integrate velocity with time to give distance travelled. From this is available pitch and roll attitude, true heading, true track, drift, present position in latitude and longitude, ground speed and wind. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. These acceleration measuring devices sense any change in the aircraft’s velocity either as an acceleration or deceleration very accurately. The acceleration signal from the amplifier is sent to an integrator which is a time multiplication device. It starts out with acceleration which is in feet per second squared. In the integrator, it is multiplied by time and the result is a velocity in feet per second. With an input of feet per second, it is then sent through a second integrator, which is multiplied by time, the result is a distance in feet or nautical miles. The computer associated with the inertial system knows the latitude and longitude of the take-off point and calculates that the aircraft has travelled so far in the north and east direction. The computer can then compute the new position of the aircraft and give a digital read-out.",

These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes. Input data is also required, such as the: TAS - to calculate the wind speed/direction. Initial position – because actual aircraft position during the flight is calculated based on the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – the platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. GNSS (GPS) Position - in order to bound the INS position error. Other inptus are: Mach Number, Radio height, Number of satellites and Angle of attack. Note: The correct option was selected according to EASA LO 022.05.01.01.02 which states 'State that inertial systems require no external input, except TAS, to determine aircraft attitude and navigational data.'

The laser gyros allow a microprocessor to maintain a stable platform mathematically, rather than mechanically. - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data.

In NAV mode, the gyro outputs are transmitted to the INS computer that will send corrective indications to the motors to keep the platform level. The accelerometer outputs will be transmitted to the integrators to obtain the speed and distance. If for some reason the NAV mode becomes inoperative (if it loses its alignment reference during flight), the system can still be used in the ATT mode by switching the selector on the mode selector unit of the INS accordingly. In ATT mode (attitude only), the platform will supply only attitude and heading data.",

Instead, the system uses ring laser gyros (RLGs) that are attached to the aircraft structure in a specific orientation, and are therefore referred to as strapped-down. The coordinate system for computations is composed of the 3 aircraft axes. The IRS uses 3 accelerometers and 3 RLGs that are installed at right angles to one another to measure linear accelerations and rotations around the aircraft axes. A high-performance computer creates a virtual stabilised platform that is kept aligned by using information from the gyros. Note that there is no physical platform that is kept aligned/level. In flight, the aircraft moves around the centre of gravity (CG). Placing the IRS unit close to the CG improves the reliability of the readings and reduces the amount of IRS drift experienced. RLGs produce two, constant, high-frequency beams of light that travel over a system of mirrors/through fibreoptics, in opposite directions. When the RLG is at rest, the signal from both beams is identical. When a RLG is rotated about its sensitive axis, both beams are affected by the Doppler effect. One is red shifted, and the other blue shifted. This causes a phase difference which can be interpreted by the computer to map motion. \"The IRS is located a bit away from the aircraft CG and it uses laser gyros to calculate accelerations.\" INCORRECT. The laser gyros do not detect accelerations - accelerometers do that job. Furthermore, as stated above, it is located close to the CG of the aircraft. \"It consists of gyros and accelerometers. The gyros keep the platform level and the accelerometers calculate acceleration.\" INCORRECT. The older stable-platform INS uses gyros and accelerometers on a level platform. \"The IRS is most reliable using lower frequency laser beams.\" INCORRECT. Laser gyros use a high frequency excitation of the laser gas, not low frequency.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. LEVELLING AND ALIGNMENT For a conventional gyro system, the process of levelling and alignment takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It is important that the aeroplane does not move during this process, because the resultant accelerations upset the system, preventing the platform from aligning. This process also requires corrections to be applied, which are dependent on the system being ‘told’ the accurate value of the present latitude and longitude. The alignment process is unsuccessful if the wrong latitude is initially entered into the system; if the error is small, it leads to poor alignment and degraded accuracy. If the latitude error is large, the platform is unable to align. If the longitude is however wrongly inserted during the initialisation process, it does not adversely affect the alignment process, but will affect the accuracy of any subsequent position. This is because the INS is a direct reading system, and if you start with a wrong position all subsequent positions are wrong.",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

Some of the main advantages of the more modern IRS are: - The solid-state sensors are more reliable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical gyroscopes. They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data. For example, errors caused by temperature changes, sensor drift, or other external factors. While traditional INS systems using mechanical gyroscopes and stand-alone computers are still in use in many aircraft today, IRS systems offer several advantages over their predecessors, including higher accuracy, faster response times, and better reliability.",

Old INSs used large platforms that remained correctly oriented with the ground (and True North) but modern Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs) are a small device which does not have to move, and uses computers to calculate speed and movements. There is a requirement to initialise inertial systems before flight, and the aircraft must be still, with the known exact location inputted into the system by the pilots (or automatically these days). The INS/IRS also takes some time to get its own systems aligned, and judge the Earth's rotation, find True North, etc. Depending on the system (old INS's take much longer and are less accurate), this takes 5-10 minutes in mid latitudes, and up to 17 minutes at high latitudes (>70°). The learning objectives (022-Instruments) say 10-20 minutes, but this is for the oldest INSs. In this case, we can use the standard figure of 10 minutes, where the aircraft is still, and the INS/IRSs can become aligned.

It is used for the aircraft inertial navigation systems and attitude/heading reference systems. It is a very accurate system to measure rotation about a given axis and is widespread in modern commercial aircraft IRS systems. Conventional gyro’s rotation mass is replaced by two contra-rotating beams of light. The case of the RLG is made of a vitreous ceramic material of low-temperature coefficient. Two gas-tight openings are carefully designed into the single-piece case of the RLG, which are then filled with inert gas, such as a mixture of Helium and Neon. A direct current electrical discharge ionizes the gas and creates two beams of light flowing in opposite directions in the two cavities of the RLG case. In order to produce a continuous laser circuit in the enclosed area of the RLG’s case, a set of mirrors is installed to reflect and trap the laser beams. The frequency of oscillation of each beam depends on the optical path length and corresponds to the cavity resonance condition. When the RLG is stationary, both optical path lengths of each beam are identical. However, when the RLG is rotated about the axis perpendicular to the laser beams plane, one beam will travel a larger distance, and the other will cover a shorter distance. The frequency difference induced by different path lengths is proportional to the rotation rate.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Most aircraft of any size will be fitted with at least two inertial systems. The duplication is for redundancy and so that the information can be compared for possible error. The starting point for an inertial navigation system is acceleration. If acceleration is known, then the aircraft's speed can be calculated. If the speed is known, the distance travelled can be calculated. To solve a complete navigation problem in space, we need to know the acceleration in three axes at right angles to each other. The inertial system relates its acceleration to the three axes and recognizes the direction, using three methods: Stable Platform or Stabilised Inertial Platform Wander Angle Strapdown The Stable Platform, which keeps the platform, on which the accelerometers are mounted, always level and aligned to North, and also measures acceleration relative to the platform. Alignment and levelling is done only once for each flight with the aircraft stationary on the ground. Once aligned, the inertial system is not and cannot be re-aligned for the remainder of the flight. Attitude data is still valid, and will continue to drive servo attitude and heading instruments or EFIS indications.",

The ADC collects relevant air data, automatically eliminates the position errors of its individual sensors, computes the required output parameters and provides them to as many systems as desired. Some air data can be displayed without further computations. These are the TAT, altitude and IAS. Because systems errors are internally corrected, IAS is equal to CAS. The centralised processing of air data parameters allows for the computation of additional outputs, which could not be obtained from separate instruments. TAT can be converted to the actual outside air temperature (OAT) considering the flight Mach number. Once OAT has been determined, it can be used to obtain TAS from the corrected values for static and total pressure (which is CAS).

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. The quality of information is dependent on the accuracy of the initial (input) data, and the precision with which the system aligns to True North. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. To keep the reference valid, the accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Rate integrating gyros are for use as sensors to detect any departure of the platform from its level and desired alignment. BOUNDED ERRORS These errors build up to a maximum positive and negative values, and return to zero within each 84.4 minutes Schuler cycle and thus averages out over the period. The main causes of these errors are: - platform tilt, due to initial misalignment - inaccurate measurement of acceleration by accelerometers - integrator errors in the first integration stage UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE TRACK ERRORS These errors arise from the misalignment of the accelerometers in the horizontal plane, and the main causes of these errors are: - Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. - Wander of the azimuth gyro. UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE DISTANCE ERROR These errors give rise to cumulative errors in the recording of the total distance travelled. The main causes of this error are: - Wander in the levelling gyros. - Integrator errors in the second stage of integration. INHERENT ERRORS The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. Such errors vary from system to system, depending upon the balance achieved between accuracy on one hand and the simplicity of design, reliability, ease of construction and cost of production on the other.",

The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. By entering the initial position and recording the IRU operation hours, the flight crew can compare the calculated position at the end of the flight with the actual position to determine the drift. RADIAL ERROR This error provides an indication of the continuing serviceability of the INS, and is derived from the following: Radial Error = Distance of final ramp position from INS position / Elapsed time in hours, expressed in (NM/hour) When calculating the distance between two positions, consider the latitude. It is also good practice to monitor the performance of the INS at the end of each flight. Comparing the INS display with the ramp position does this, where the radial error is established using Pythagoras, which when divided by the recorded time in the navigation mode, gives the average error.",

Initial position – because actual aircraft position at any point during the flight, is calculated from the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – to stabilize the vertical navigation, thus stabilizing vertical velocity and inertial altitude information. The platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. The initial alignment and leveling of the IRS need to be carried out when the aircraft is stationary and on the ground. A set of three accelerometers will sense gravitational acceleration that will derive the local vertical of the platform. Once the vertical is found thanks to the gravity, any change of attitude in space will be detected, but they will only come from the Earth’s rotation (on the ground when stationary). Moreover, by detecting the drift due to the earth’s rotation, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) will be able to internally calculate the True North. Latitude can also be internally calculated, but because this calculation is not sufficiently precise, a manual position input is required from the flight crew for this alignment sequence. Therefore, the system will compare the inserted latitude with the calculated one and compute precisely the aircraft’s position. On the other hand, the IRS cannot calculate/measure longitude, therefore the only reference is the one provided by the pilot during the alignment process.",

If you do have any further exam feedback, please let us know in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Inertial Navigation Systems are devices which allow us to have a self contained method of navigating, via just the accelerations of the aircraft. The basic principle is that, if an INS knows the initial location of the aircraft, and knows that it is completely still at that time (during initialisation), then it can precisely measure the aircraft's turns and accelerations to calculate its current position. It uses the mathematical process of integration to first work out the aircraft's velocity and direction, then integrates again to find the change in distance, which it then adds/removes from the original location. The oldest INSs use a \"stable platform\" design, which is a large platform that is kept pointing towards True North and perfectly upright, no matter the aircraft's heading or attitude. It manages this by using 3 rate-integrating gyros to measure the aircraft's turns around all three axes, and counter them by moving the platform the other way. It can then use 2 accelerometers to calculate the North-South acceleration, and the East-West accelerations, which are fed into a mechanical computer (a complex set of cogs and gears) that provide an output of speed and position, and other useful metrics. More modern aircraft use Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs), which are a form of INS, but are connected directly to the aircraft (no stable platform). These are much lighter, and less complex to have on board, as they use a set of 3 ring laser gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers to measure all the rotations and accelerations, and then calculates into their various components (North-South, East-West and Vertical) using modern computer methods. This is called a strapdown system, as it is fixed to the aircraft, and is much more usable with other systems, as it can feed info to the FMS, etc. This question is not very well worded, as the question is asking about inertial navigation systems, but the most correct answer (and the answer from feedback) is actually more related to IRSs. To clarify, we can go through each option: \"true airspeed (TAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" This is quite blatantly wrong, airspeed is measured in one axis by the pitot tubes. \"indicated Airspeed (IAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" Same as above, still wrong. \"acceleration along the aircraft's pitch, roll and yaw axes.\" This one is nearly correct, as it does sense accelerations, but not necessarily along these axes (and these axes refer to rotations). INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions (and maybe vertically). \"acceleration along the north-south, east-west and vertical axes.\" This is most correct, but only just. As mentioned above, INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions. They can sense vertical accelerations also, if they have a third accelerometer, but this is not so well documented in the learning objectives, and is more to do with IRSs, which all measure vertical acceleration as part of their normal process. This is why this question can garner some opposing views, depending on interpretation. So far, this is our best option.",

The navigation database cannot be modified; however, it has some additional storage space where the flight crew can create and store additional waypoints, routes, navaids, etc. they might need along their route. An example of an additional waypoint could be some Decision Points, which coordinates are indicated in the Operational Flight Plan the crew receives during the briefing. On a several sectors day, it is very common that the pilot stores the flight back (the second sector) on this additional storage of the navigation database. For instance, the FMS2 Honeywell Release 1A, allows the flight crew to create and store up to 99 waypoints, 10 runways, 20 navaids, and 5 routes. This will be different from one FMS to another, but it already gives you an idea of the capability of the additional storage space of the navigation database, called the supplemental navigation database. Caution! It is really important to understand and make the difference that pilots can use the Supplemental Navigation database to write and read information => by adding their own customized waypoint or other navigation data. BUT this is limited to ONLY this Supplemental Nav database! At the time of the Main Nav database update (every 28 days) the Supp Nav database is automatically erased. It makes sense as the Supp Nav database could include waypoints that have been defined using waypoints contained in the Main Nav database that may have changed as a result of the update.",

The Flight Management System helps to reduce the flight crew’s workload by providing several extremely useful functions. One of those functions is the aid for fuel management that helps improving fuel efficiency and in-flight performance. This function will basically make internal calculations based on the aircraft weight, its cruising level, and the actual and expected wind conditions en-route to estimate the remaining fuel quantity along the flight plan. Most of the time this tool is very accurate, but the number of parameters influencing the fuel consumption makes it difficult to exactly predict the fuel consumption. That’s why you always need to do fuel checks at regular intervals during the flight and check that the fuel consumption is normal, the remaining fuel to destination is still the same, and there’s no leak. The FMS has also the ability to provide correct fuel computations even in engine-out configuration. This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions.",

Each of them conforms to a revision cycle that the crew will check and select during the cockpit preparation, usually done by the pilot flying who sets up the FMC. The nav data base is updated by maintenance every 28 days. It includes the following data: Airports Navaids Airways Waypoints Runways SID, STARS, and approach procedures Magnetic variation.

These subsystems are managed and processed by the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The FMC provides the primary navigation, flight planning, and optimized terminal routes and en route guidance for the aircraft and is typically comprised of interrelated functions such as navigation, flight planning, trajectory prediction, performance computations, and guidance. The FMC and associated databases are an essential part of modern airline avionics. An FMC typically contains three databases in addition to the basic operational flight program (OFP). The first is a software options database which activates the optional functionality contained in the OFP that is desired by the operator. The second is the model and engine performance database and contains all the aircraft performance data which allows the FMC to compute fuel burn, optimum altitudes and airspeeds, etc. The third is the Navigation Database (NDB). The NDB is contains all the information required for building a flight plan and processing that plan when airborne. All these databases are stored in the FMC on an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) card. Each of these databases can be updated via a data loader every 28 days. AIRAC updated every 28 days contains read only data but the pilot is still able to enter fixes, phantom stations and adjust parameters according to how he needs it within certain limits The NDB contains terminal and en route fixes; waypoints and navigation reference system (NRS) grid points; intersections; airways and radio navigation aids. It also contains airports; runways; STAR and SID; holding patterns; and instrument approaches such as VOR, non-directional beacon, area navigation (RNAV), required navigation performance (RNP), satellite based navigation system (SBAS), and ground based navigation system (GBAS).",

A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies.

This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions. Aid with navigation - lateral and vertical flight plan management: The FMS calculates the aircraft trajectory so that it respects any inserted constraints (altitude, speed, distance, etc. Aircraft position computation - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and the GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength. The workload is greatly reduced because the flight crew only need to cross-check with their charts that the correct frequencies are automatically inserted.",

ADC - The FMS collects all the information provided by the ADC. Most of them are only indirectly used, however, all of them are used for monitoring and recording purposes that you can access at any time. AS an example of a direct application, vertical navigation management is generally performed based on the baro altitude input from the ADC. In the same way, the managed vertical guidance of the FMS can command a flight path angle or a speed target, and both of these parameters require inputs from the ADC. Aircraft position - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and the GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Data from the FMC navigation database - The navigation database of the FMC contains all the information that would normally be obtained from the navigation charts. For instance, you would find navaids, airports, runways, approaches (with constraints, specific features), STARs, SIDs, and company routes. In each aircraft, the FMC has two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days.

            "explanation": "The core functionality of the Flight Management System (FMS) is the creation of a flight plan and of the four-dimensional aircraft trajectory. The Flight Management System helps to reduce the flight crew’s workload by providing the following major functions: Aid for fuel management - improve fuel efficiency and performance optimization: The FMS has the ability to provide correct fuel computations even in engine-out configuration. This greatly reduces the flight crew’s workload, especially under such stressful conditions. Aid with navigation - lateral and vertical flight plan management: The FMS calculates the aircraft trajectory so that it respects any inserted constraints (altitude, speed, distance, etc. Aircraft position computation - The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength. The workload is greatly reduced because the flight crew only need to cross-check with their charts that the correct frequencies are automatically inserted.",

            "explanation": "GPS POSITION The Flight Management Computer (FMGC) computes its own aircraft position ('FM' position) from an IRS position and a computed radio position, or a GPS position. Each IRS computes a mixed IRS/GPS position called the GPIRS position. For this, each IRS can independently select their GPS source in order to maximize the availability of GPS data. If the GPIRS data does not comply with an integrity criterion that is based on a Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) and on the automatic detection of failed satellites, the FMS rejects the GPS mode and uses the radio position update. The flight crew can deselect/select the GPS position on the SELECTED NAVAIDS page, if necessary. Without GPS PRIMARY (GPS deselected or inoperative) the navigation accuracy is lower and is a function of ground radio navaid infrastructure or elapsed time since the last radio update. RNAV(GNSS) approaches may be performed, provided GPS PRIMARY is available and with AP or FD engaged. The flight crew may check the position computation using the POSITION MONITOR page. RAIM Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitor (RAIM) is a form of integrity monitoring performed within the avionics themselves. It ensures available satellite signals meet the integrity requirements for a given phase of flight. By comparing the distance measurements of a number of satellites, the RAIM function can identify a satellite failure and issue an alert to the pilot. Without RAIM capability, the pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position. A minimum of five satellites is required to detect a bad satellite; at least six satellites are required to detect and exclude a bad satellite from the navigation solution if your receiver has a fault detection and exclusion (FDE) RAIM algorithm.",

The FMGC navigation data base includes most information that would normally be determined by referring to navigation charts. The stored information includes the location of navigation aids, airports, runways and other airline selected information such as SIDs, STARs, approaches and company routes. The FMGC contains two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days. Each set corresponds to the normal revision cycle for navigation charts. During preflight the flight crew can select which set is active. Cycling the database erases the primary and secondary flight plans, as well as stored data. The flight crew must never do this in flight. The contents of the navigation data base are updated by maintenance every 28 days.",

The FMS uses a position that is a combination of the IRS position, GPS position and radio position (auto-tuning ground nav-aids). The FMS selects the best-calculated position based on a figure of merit and priority, called a Kalman Filter. For instance, GPS is the most accurate indication of position, so is usually the main input, but when that is no longer accurate enough, the FMS has to use the IRS and radio position, also depending on their current availability. Of course, IRS position is the most available data, as it does not require external information, but radio position is often more accurate, when available.

Modern FMS systems are very clever, and can automatically deselect GPS inputs if they become erroneous or lose signal, however, this is detrimental to the accuracy of the system, and will then have to use less accurate position data. This means that the aircraft may have a different position to what is calculated by the FMS, due to this lack of accuracy.

Additionally, the bearing needles could also be displayed. The navaids are automatically tuned from the received signal and the navigation database of the FMS. The FMS computed position along the flight plan is derived from the data provided by the IRS, DME, VOR, and the GPS. A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. The output of all this visible on the EFIS is the aircraft position along the flight plan route, its offset (when under radar vectoring), and any relative position from a navaid, airport, obstacle. The TCAS and AWR are standalone systems that are not interacting with the FMS. Therefore, the outputs displayed on the EFIS are not from the FMS.",
