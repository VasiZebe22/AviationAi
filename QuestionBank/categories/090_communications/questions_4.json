As mentioned in the learning objective above, occasionally, it is useful for ATC to request that an aircraft changes its call sign in order to provide adequate difference with an aircraft of similar call sign, or to avoid confusion when referring to any other things such as locations or procedures, which might sound the same as a call sign. In this case, the two aircraft have very similar callsigns, only separated by \"Tango\" vs \"Bravo\", which are both similar sounding words. In this case, much confusion could be had when conversing with those aircraft, and it is therefore best to ask one to change their call sign. It is usually up to the controller to choose a different call sign, and in this case, they could change \"AT139\" to \"Helicopter 139\", for instance. The messages to change (and then later on revert) call sign from the controller would be: CHANGE YOUR CALL SIGN TO (new call sign) [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED] REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALL SIGN (call sign) [AT (significant point)]",

ICAO Doc 10037 Global Operational Data Link (GOLD) Manual 1.2.3. CPDLC connection management 1.2.3.1.1. The purpose of a CPDLC connection is to allow the exchange of CPDLC messages between an aircraft and an ATS unit (active connection), and also to provide an advance connection with the next ATS unit (inactive connection). An aircraft can have a maximum of two CPDLC connections established concurrently, each with a different ATS unit. Only one CPDLC connection can be active at any given time; any second connection is inactive. 1.2.3.3.2. The ATS unit initiates a CPDLC connection by sending a CPDLC connection request to the aircraft as 1.2.3.3.3. Provided there is no existing CPDLC connection, the aircraft system: a) accepts the connection request; b) establishes this CPDLC connection as the active connection; and c) responds with a CPDLC connection confirm. 1.2.3.5. Transferring CPDLC connections 1.2.3.5.1. Under normal circumstances, the CDA will initiate a CPDLC transfer to an adjacent ATS unit as the aircraft transits from the current ATS unit to another CPDLC-capable ATS unit. These transfers are normally automatic, without flight crew action. “Disconnected from LOVV. Connecting to LOVL”: This transmission indicates that the aircraft's CPDLC system has autonomously managed the transition between the CPDLC ground stations. LOVV refers to the control center that the aircraft was previously connected to, and LOVL is the new control center it has connected to. This automatic handover is a standard process in CPDLC to maintain continuous communication as the aircraft moves through different airspace sectors.",

Detailed SELCAL procedures may be found in Annex 10, Volume II. 11.1.3 Any necessary SELCAL check shall be initiated by using the phrase “REQUEST SELCAL CHECK”. Subsequent receipt of the SELCAL code tone should be acknowledged by the phrase “SELCAL OK”. 11.1.4 In case the coded signal is weak or unable to activate the cockpit call system, the pilot should advise the controller by using the phrase “NEGATIVE SELCAL, TRY AGAIN”.",

Note.— The abbreviated term “ADS contract” is commonly used to refer to ADS event contract, ADS demand contract, ADS periodic contract or an emergency mode. The ADS (Automatic Dependent Surveillance) is a FANS application that consists in automatically sending aircraft surveillance data to the ATC. The set of data to downlink is defined automatically, without any crew action. The different types of ADS contracts can be: Periodic – at periodic time intervals. On demand – when asked for by the ATC. On event – whenever a specified event occurs. Emergency messages can also be sent through the ADS application. When a MAYDAY datalink message is sent to the ATC, the ADS contract is switched to a high periodic reporting rate.",

Runway Visual Range (RVR) is the range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. Prefix Definition Example M If visibility is less than the lowest reportable RVR value. R36/M0600 = indicates the RVR for runway 36 is less than 600 m. P if visibility is greater than the highest reportable value R36/P6000 = indicates the RVR for runway 36 is greater than 6000 m. V When RVR varies by more than one reportable value over a 10-minute period, the lowest and highest values are paired with a \"V\" between them. R36/1100V1500 = indicates the RVR for runway 36 is varying between 1100 m and 1500 m.

VOLMET - continuous and repetitive voice broadcast covering an area and several airports' current METAR, SPECI, TAF and SIGMET. In this question, the crew need to collect the weather information for a number of airports in order to decide on a diversion option. The clue in the question is 'the quickest way to obtain weather information'. Calling several airports on the radio to ask for individual weather reports would take time and is normally not practical. ATC at major airports would not have the time to issue such reports. Selecting ATIS is an option but it would take time to individually collect the reports for several airports, and there is the question of being in range to receive the signal. VOLMET is the quickest option and using D-VOLMET (Datalink) ensures no problem with radio range.",

Therefore, we should attempt to make contact on an alternative suitable frequency. These can be found on en-route charts, and if those are not available or cannot be contacted, then 121.5 MHz can be used to establish comms and ask for a suitable frequency based on your position. If you do happen to have recently changed over to the frequency, in the last couple of minutes for instance, then it might be worth enquiring on your previous frequency about alternative frequencies to use.| Therefore, a few of these options are partially correct as part of working out an alternative frequency to use, but the only fully correct answer is to \"find an alternative frequency.\"",

There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

We firmly believe that this question should be appealed. The primary responsibility of GROUND control is to manage and monitor surface movements, which encompass the movement of aircraft on the runway. In some instances, an aircraft that has landed, and is still on the runway, may be transferred to GROUND from TOWER control. The GROUND controller will then provide clearance for the aircraft to proceed to its designated parking area. In addition to aircraft movements, GROUND control is also responsible for regulating the movements of vehicles operating on the aerodrome surface. This includes the coordination of the movement of baggage trolleys, fuel trucks, and other ground vehicles that support aircraft operations. By doing so, GROUND control ensures the safe and efficient operation of the aerodrome surface. Movement area.

ICAO Annex 10 1.3 Communication Methods Air-ground communication. Two-way communication between aircraft and stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. Air-to-ground communication. One-way communication from aircraft to stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. ICAO Annex 10, Volume 2, Communication Procedures Simplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations takes place in one direction at a time. Note.— In application to the aeronautical mobile service this method may be subdivided as follows: a) single channel simplex; b) double channel simplex; c) offset frequency simplex. *Single channel simplex. Simplex using the same frequency channel in each direction. *Offset frequency simplex. A variation of single channel simplex wherein telecommunication between two stations is effected by using in each direction frequencies that are intentionally slightly different but contained within a portion of the spectrum allotted for the operation. *Double channel simplex. Simplex using two frequency channels one in each direction. Duplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations can take place in both directions simultaneously. Note: the term \"half-duplex\" is not mentioned by ICAO and EASA. Students also have not reported that \"half duplex\" has been mentioned in exams, but only simplex and duplex. In several other sources you can get the following information: Simplex: communication in one direction only Half duplex: communication in both directions (alternating) Full duplex: communication in both directions (simultaneously)",

We have, therefore, updated the correct answer to the only possible answer. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam. Thank you. SELCAL is abbreviated for Selective Calling System and it is used in international aviation to alert flight crews of transmission directed to them as they fly transoceanic routes. SECAL operates on HF or VHF frequency bands. An individual aircrafts owns its unique SELCAL code which is used by the controller to address the SELCAL on board of the aircraft. The code is converted into four designated audio tones, then it is broadcast and every aircraft, which has a SELCAL system, receives it. The decoding system reads the tones and triggers a warning for the flight crew if it recognizes its own code. Relating phraseology: When an aeronautical station initiates a call by SELCAL, the aircraft replies with its radio call sign, followed by the phrase “GO AHEAD”. Request SELCAL check XX-XXX (SELCAL code of the aircraft) SELCAL check is coming up for XX-XXX SELCAL OK or NEGATIVE SELCAL ICAO Annex 10 Volume II CHAPTER 5. AERONAUTICAL MOBILE SERVICE — VOICE COMMUNICATIONS 5.2.4 SELCAL procedures 5.2.4.1.1 PANS.— With the selective calling system known as SELCAL, the voice calling is replaced by the transmission of coded tones to the aircraft over the radiotelephony channels. A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",

Note 2.— Caution must be exercised with respect to the indication of transmitting channels in VHF radiotelephony communications when all six digits of the numerical designator are used in airspace where communication channels are separated by 25 kHz, because on aircraft installations with a channel separation capability of 25 kHz or more, it is only possible to select the first five digits of the numerical designator on the radio management panel. 2.4.5 In airspace where all VHF voice communications channels are separated by 25 kHz or more and the use of six digits as in 2.4.4 is not substantiated by the operational requirement determined by the appropriate authorities, the first five digits of the numerical designator should be used, except in the case of both the fifth and sixth digits being zeros, in which case only the first four digits should be used. Note 1.— The following examples illustrate the application of the procedure in 2.4.5 and the associated settings of the aircraft radio management panel for communication equipment with channel separation capabilities of 25 kHz and 8.33/25 kHz: (4.5.)",

If anyone encounters a similar question, we kindly request that you inform us. We appreciate your assistance. Thank you! SELCAL is a system used by air traffic control to selectively call individual aircraft over RT channels, which means that the flight crew doesn't have to monitor the channel continuously, especially on long-haul flights. So, we can actually say that it may be used by the controller to start a conversation. As for the \"correct\" answer, it's not entirely accurate to say that SELCAL is used to permit the controller to give instructions or clearance. The controller can give instructions or clearance even if the aircraft is not equipped with SELCAL. The primary purpose of SELCAL is to alert the crew that they need to make contact with ATS and to provide aural and/or visual cues through cockpit call systems. In short, SELCAL is used to alert the crew to contact ATS and eliminates the need for continuous monitoring of the RT call-sign. When an aircraft receives a SELCAL notification, the crew responds with their call sign and \"go ahead\".",

The call should be made on the frequency in use at the time, and the station addressed will normally be that station communicating with the aircraft, or the station in whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating. All other stations should take care not to interfere with the transmission of urgency traffic. => With regards to this question, there is no reason to call \"MAYDAY\" - we are not facing a distress situation - it is rather a possible technical malfunction (which is yet to be confirmed).",

Note 2.— Caution must be exercised with respect to the indication of transmitting channels in VHF radiotelephony communications when all six digits of the numerical designator are used in airspace where communication channels are separated by 25 kHz, because on aircraft installations with a channel separation capability of 25 kHz or more, it is only possible to select the first five digits of the numerical designator on the radio management panel. 2.4.5 In airspace where all VHF voice communications channels are separated by 25 kHz or more and the use of six digits as in 2.4.4 is not substantiated by the operational requirement determined by the appropriate authorities, the first five digits of the numerical designator should be used, except in the case of both the fifth and sixth digits being zeros, in which case only the first four digits should be used.

The current answer is the one we believe to be most correct, but we are seeing that the Polish authority has a different correct answer which is \"Expected approach time five zero\". We are in need of more feedback about this one, so please send us anything you can remember from the exam via the comments, the feedback section of the website, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! We emphasize that, the correct option in the Polish authority is \"Expected approach time five zero\".",

More comprehensive phrases are contained in subsequent Chapters in the context in which they are most commonly used. 3.8 The precise phraseology used in the transmission and acknowledgement of climb and descent clearances will vary, depending upon the circumstances, traffic density and nature of the flight operations. 3.9 However, care must be taken to ensure that misunderstandings are not generated as a consequence of the phraseology employed during these phases of flight. For example, levels may be reported as altitude, height or flight levels according to the phase of flight and the altimeter setting. Therefore, when passing level messages, the following conventions apply: 1. The word ‘to’ is to be omitted from messages relating to FLIGHT LEVELS. 2. All messages relating to an aircraft’s climb or descent to a HEIGHT or ALTITUDE employ the word ‘to’ followed immediately by the word HEIGHT or ALTITUDE. Furthermore, the initial message in any such RTF exchange will also include the appropriate QFE or QNH. Furthermore, the words FEET and FLIGHT LEVEL must never be omitted. NOTE: Even though regulation states that the term “TO” shall be followed by altitude, it seems that the correct option does not state “Altitude”. Therefore, we would say that the most correct option is “Climbing to two thousand five hundred feet.” As there is no “Climbing to altitude two thousand five hundred feet” option available.",

A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",
