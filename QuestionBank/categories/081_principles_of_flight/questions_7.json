If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

As a side note; slipping in the turn will make it more likely to stall the outside wing, which is slightly better. Skidding turns are especially bad, as they amplify the problems mentioned above, and make it very probable that the inner wing will stall first, which will quickly become a spin.",

The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. The margin between the two types of stall narrows with increasing altitude. Notably the true airspeed of the low-speed stall increases with increasing altitude for a given indicated airspeed, whilst the true airspeed of the shock stall reduces up to the base of the tropopause, above which it remains constant. The point at which the two stalls coincide is referred to as the 'coffin corner'. The altitude at which an aircraft can fly at one airspeed in a 1g maneuver is called the aerodynamic ceiling. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3g will initiate the buffet onset.",

Please let us know if you see it in your exam, and which exam that is, thank you! TAILPLANE STALL Whilst it is not immediately identifiable by the question, this is asking about tailplane stalls due to icing. The tailplane (or horizontal stabiliser) is a second wing mounted at the rear of the aircraft to allow for stability, and for control (with the elevator), and in fact, is usually used to provide downwards lift to keep the aircraft's nose up, and counteract the weight/lift couple (which pushes the nose down). The tailplane is often quite a lot thinner than the main wing, so it builds up ice quicker, and means that tailplane stall due to icing can occur when there is little to no main wing ice accretion. A tailplane stall is made worse by the extension of flaps, as they increase the downwash from the main wing, which causes a larger negative angle of attack on the tailplane, which is more likely to stall the tailplane. Flaps also move the centre of pressure further back, which increases the Cg/Cp (Weight/Lift) couple, which means the elevator needs to create more downforce to keep the nose up. As the downforce from the tail decreases due to tail stall, there is a strong nose-down moment created. This is made worse - as mentioned above - by the use of flaps. The worst speed/configuration for this type of stall is just under the maximum flap speed (VFE), with flaps extended.",

When swept wings are unmodified, they have a strong tendency to stall first near the tips. Loss of lift at the tips moves the CP forward, giving a nose-up pitching moment as the lift is being produce from further forwards. This tendency to tip stall is due to the induced spanwise flow of the boundary layer from root to tip. During a tip stall, all the lift production is concentrated inboard and the maximum downwash now impacts the tail plane, adding to the nose-up pitching moment. As soon as a swept wing begins to stall, both forward CP movement and increased downwash at the tail plane cause the aircraft nose to rise rapidly, further increasing the angle of attack. This is a very undesirable and unacceptable response at the stall and can result in complete loss of control in pitch from which it may be very difficult, or even impossible, to recover. This is a very dangerous characteristic of many high speed, swept wing aircraft. For this reason, commercial swept wing aircraft are fitted with modifications to ensure the root stalls first. These can be vortex generators, or washout of the wing to reduce the tip angle of incidence, etc.",

Wings on large aircraft are usually tapered and swept back, but here we are talking of unswept wings only. Tapered wings are prone to stalling first near the wing tips, and this stall spreads out forwards and inwards towards the root. This is undesireable as the stall affects the ailerons first, and makes this planform very susceptible to a violent wing drop. The first sign of stall on these aeroplanes often comes as a buffet through the ailerons, starting light and getting heavier, until the ailerons are fully stalled and have either a reverse effect or very little effect on aircraft control. Given where the stall occurs, and the likelihood of an early wing drop, elevator buffet is unlikely and pitching moments are quite limited. There is sometimes a pitch down moment due to the Centre of Pressure moving rearwards during the stall, but it is often not enough to avoid the formation of a spin. Hence, these aircraft wing planforms are usually modified in some way to avoid tip stalls and encourage the wing roots to stall first.",

This required a higher angle of attack, and obviously the pilot has exceeded the critical angle of attack in this case, and stalled the aeroplane. The low-speed stall occurs because boundary layer becomes detached from the upper surface of the wing. This happens because the low pressure at the front of the wing upper surface becomes too strong, and the airflow gets too slow (de-energised), so the strong adverse pressure gradient pulls back the low speed air within the boundary layer, and eventually the air current starts to flip, and the boundary layer separates completely, causing turbulent, stalled airflow.

            "explanation": "Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that decreasing load factor (push-over maneuver) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that increasing weight (mass) decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

The ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone) is an area of very large uplift and often violent thunderstorms due to converging air at the surface. It is also a region where the tropopause will be incredibly high, sometimes in the region of 55-60,000 ft. This makes it often impossible to climb away from the turbulence experienced in that region. The turbulence can cause lots of passenger distress and potential for airframe fatigue and damage when it gets severe enough. It can also change our airspeed enough to put us into either the high- or low-speed buffeting region, so we should instead descend to a lower altitude, out of the potential “coffin corner” and fly at turbulence penetration speed (this usually means slowing down from cruise speed) to get the best safety margin for turbulence.",

It is highly useful for reducing the load on the wings, and can break a stall immediately, as an aircraft cannot stall when the load factor is zero, allowing control to be regained temporarily to allow the aircraft to be stabilised and the airspeed to be increased. The angle of attack is reduced during a push-over manoeuvre, and this is a key part of unloading the wings.",

Load Factor = Lift / Weight LOAD FACTOR IN A TURN When an aircraft is in a banked turn, lift must be increased so as to maintain the vertical component of lift equal to weight. Load Factor (n) increases with bank angle at an increasing rate. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. This relationship may be expressed as: Load Factor (n) = 1 / cos φ Where φ = bank angle In a turn, load factor is a function ONLY of bank angle. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given airspeed is inversly proportional to the bank angle. Which means that decreasing the bank angle results in a radius of turn that greater. RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

A clean wing has a lower value of CLMAX, causing the Angle of Attack for a clean wing to be lower than for a wing with slats extended. A wing with flaps extended has the lowest value of CLMAX. In straight and level flight, prior to the stall, lift remains constant. Speed decreases and CL increases. In the stall (so after CLMAX has passed) the CL decreases again and speed is still low.

Option d) \"buffet is so strong that it deters the pilot from further speed reduction.\" is the correct answer because when an airplane approaches a stall, the airflow over the wings becomes turbulent, which can cause buffeting or vibration of the aircraft.

Impending Stall—an impending stall occurs when the AOA causes a stall warning, but has not yet reached the critical AOA. Indications of an impending stall can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning. Full Stall—a full stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically that an uncommanded nose-down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and this may be accompanied by an uncommanded rolling motion. The flying controls will feel unresponsive or “mushy”. For airplanes equipped with stick pushers, its activation is also a full stall indication.",

Lift is inclined from the vertical by the bank angle φ of 45° and must be increased in order to balance the weight and produce a force to perform the turn. More lift compared to the same weight increases the load factor n. Influence of the Load Factor (n) on Stall Speed VS = VS1G x √ n Because the load factor (n) increases in a turn, stall speed will increase accordingly. An accelerated stall is caused by abrupt or excessive control movements inducing an increased load factor. An accelerated stall can occur during a sudden change in the flight path, during manoeuvres such as steep turns or a recovery from a descent. It is called an accelerated stall because it occurs at a load factor greater than 1g. The stall is more violent than a 1g stall and is often unexpected because of the relatively high airspeed.",

During a skid, the aircraft is turning too fast for the bank angle, and yaws into the turn. (Most likely, you're pushing too much rudder and causing the skid.) That causes the outside wing to move faster, increasing its lift, and causing the aircraft to roll into the turn. You compensate by adding opposite aileron - increasing the angle of attack on the inside, low wing. As the inside wing exceeds the critical angle of attack, it stalls and drops. The downward deflected aileron on the low wing is still generating drag, which pulls the aircraft's nose further into the turn. And, the aircraft is still yawing into the turn from the rudder, which accelerates the roll. The result is a quick roll into the turn, and your entry into an incipient spin => In a skidding spin, the low/inside wing stalls first, which rolls the plane into the turn, flipping it \"inside\" or \"underneath\".",

            ],
            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

This speed is Mmo most of the time, sometimes it is slightly below. These speeds come closer together as altitude increases. At a certain altitude the aircraft can encounter the so called “Coffin corner”. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are very close together here, and thus it is easy to stall or hit Mmo. The coffin corner is a dangerous situation and is supposed to be avoided, as a slight amount of turbulence could cause the aircraft to stall. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor. The margins between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: Higher aircraft weight Higher altitude Higher load factor More forward CG position",

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is correct. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

There are three phases of spin: INCIPIENT phase - exists from the time the aeroplane stalls and rotation starts until the spin is fully developed. This may not occur until 2 to 4 rotations have been completed - however, according to EASA, incipient spin starts already whenever, in the post stall regime, there is an uncommanded roll in excess of 45 degrees which is the result of yaw assymetry during a stall. During this phrase, the aerodynamic forces are not balanced and the aircraft is more or less tumbling. DEVELOPED phase - begins when the aerodynamic forces are in balance (the angular rotation rates, airspeed and vertical descent rate are stabilized from one turn to the next). The spin, although chaotic looking from inside the cockpit, has been established and recovery procedures are now necessary to break the spin. RECOVERY phase - controls are applied to stop spin, recover from the unusual attitude and maintain straight and level.",

Whatever happens, as the aircraft continues to climb, the actual airspeed is unknown whilst the indicated airspeed (IAS) is showing a continuous increase. This is particularly dangerous in modes such as level change or flight level change, which maintain a constant airspeed/Mach No. in the climb, as the aircraft would pitch up more and more to try to reduce the \"increasing airspeed\", stalling the aircraft quite quickly. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

If the wings have been mounted with different angles of incidence, then they will constantly be at a different angles of attack. The wing with the higher angle of incidence will always be at a higher angle of attack. Whilst this could be quite noticeable in normal flight, it would likely be most noticeable at or near the stall speed, where the wing with a slightly higher angle of attack will be the one to stall first, but whilst the other wing is still producing a lot of lift. This would cause a violent wing drop towards the side of the stalled wing. This theory is used on some wings to make sure that the wing root stalls first, by twisting the wing to give the root a higher angle of incidence than the wing tip. This is called \"washout\".",

The shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value for a given angle of attack. Wings not specifically designed for high speeds may experience significant lift loss at speeds above MCRIT. However, wings designed for high-speed flight, incorporating features like sweepback, thinner sections, and reduced camber, exhibit much less variation in lift throughout the transonic region. Sweeping the wing back is a widely employed method to increase MCRIT, the critical Mach number. By employing a swept wing, the free stream velocity is effectively divided into two components: one perpendicular to the leading edge and the other parallel to it. The component perpendicular to the leading edge is less than the free stream velocity and it is this velocity component which determines the magnitude of the pressure distribution and hence MCRIT. Due to this reduced velocity component affecting the pressure distribution, MCRIT increases. Furthermore, on wings with low thickness to chord ratios, the airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface is diminished. Consequently, the value of MCRIT is raised on such wings.",

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.80 to the FL400 curve. From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor to asset the limiting weight. In this case, the limiting weight is 110 tons.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d. Unresponsive flight controls.",

With the CG furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided.

Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range.

If an actual wing were allowed to stall in this way, stalling would give aileron buffet and perhaps violent wing drop.

To give favourable stall characteristics, many wing types must be modified using one or more of the following: Geometric twist (washout), a decrease in incidence from root to tip. This decreases the angle of attack at the tip, and the root will tend to stall first, which is desirable. The aerofoil section may be varied throughout the span such that sections with greater thickness and camber are located near the tip. The higher CLMAX of such sections delays stall earlier, so that the root will tend to stall first.",

High temperatures cause low pressure, The main feature of the ITCZ is extensive Cu, Cb, and thunderstorms. The cloud tops are sometimes as low as 20,000 ft but more frequently 50,000 ft or more. Turbulence is usually severe, as is icing, which can be from 16,000 ft upwards. Buffet Onset Chart In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. The ‘Buffet Onset’ chart is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. Turbulence Penetration Speed For flight in turbulence an airspeed must be chosen to give margin against stalling and overstressing the aircraft structure. This speed is VRA/MRA (the rough-air speed) or turbulence penetration speed. VRA/MRA will give adequate protection from over-stressing the aircraft with maximum protection from an inadvertent stall. In conclusion, clear air turbulence (CAT) can be caused by jetstreams, Cb’s, mountain waves, etc. with the same consequences as the ITCZ or jetstreams. Thunderstorms should be circumnavigated and preferably upwind. Extensive use of weather radar scanning is useful. A turbulence penetration speed should be selected to minimise the gust loads on the aircraft. When possible, descent to a lower altitude should be considered as it gives more performance and buffet margin to cope with gusts.",

The pressure distribution over the front of the wing is, however, altered, which varies the position of the wing’s center of pressure and its overall pitching moment. This alters the wing’s angle of attack and results in rapid backward and forward movements of the shock waves. A kind of instability is set up, and the rapid changes in the pressure distribution result in vibration of the whole aircraft. This is primarily due to the distributed airflow behind the shock wave hitting the tail plane. If shock waves form on the control surfaces, it will also affect the stick forces by altering their hinge moments.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

Consideration must be given to the pitching moment contribution of each aircraft component. The pitching moment coefficients contributed by all the various components of the aircraft are summed and plotted versus lift coefficient (angle of attack). Figure 1, shows the variation of pitching moment coefficient (CM) with lift coefficient (CL) for an aircraft with positive static longitudinal stability. Static stability is shown by a return to equilibrium, or trim, upon displacement. The aeroplane described by graph A is in trim or equilibrium when CM = 0. If the aeroplane is disturbed to some different CL, the pitching moment change tends to return the aircraft to the point of trim. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some higher CL (point y), a negative or nose-down pitching moment is produced which tends to decrease angle of attack back to the trim point. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some lower CL (point x), a positive or nose-up pitching moment is developed which tends to increase the angle of attack back to the trim point. Positive static longitudinal stability is indicated by a negative slope of CM versus CL. The degree of static longitudinal stability is indicated by the slope of the curve. Effect of Wing and Tail Position (figure 2) When the aerodynamic stability of a configuration is looked at, power effects are ignored and the stability is considered by a build-up of the contributing components. If the CG is set at 30 ̊ percent MAC, the contribution of the wing alone is destabilising, as indicated by the positive slope of CM versus CL. The combination of the wing and fuselage increases the instability. The contribution of the tail alone is highly stabilising from the large negative slope of the curve. By moving the tail aft (increasing the distance to the CG) and increasing its area both contribute to the stabilising moment, which means that the slope will be steeper, making this the correct answer.",

In a statically stable system, when disturbed, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Dynamic stability, on the other hand, covers what happens after this. An aircraft can only have any measurement of dynamic stability if it is first statically stable. If an aircraft is then dynamically stable, the oscillations will gradually reduce until the aircraft is back at equilibrium. Neutral dynamic stability will mean the aircraft continues to oscillate either side of equilibrium by the same amount (no damping). Dynamic instability (negative dynamic stability) means the aircraft oscillations get larger in magnitude each time. For this question, it is very important to note that any form of dynamic stability (or instability) can only come if the aircraft first has positive static stability. Without first going towards the equilibrium point, there are no oscillations to either shrink or grow. This means there is only one possible correct answer.",

This is dependant on whether the c.g is located in front or behind the centre of pressure. Due to the decrease in positive lift or increase in negative lift of the tail, the main wing will have to compensate and produce more lift. Therefore a forward c.g will cause a higher value of wing lift. Secondly, on the right side of the figure, we can see the effect of a decrease in thrust on the aircraft at high angle of attack (slow speed flight). At high AoA the thrust will have a strong vertical component, therefore a high thrust will help lift the aircraft up and reduce the lift required. This is opposite when the thrust is reduced at high AoA, then the wings will have to compensate and create more lift to remain in level flight.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: We believe that \"greater than\" is the correct answer here (and most recent feedback seems to agree), but we have varying feedback about the correct answer over the past few months. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, thanks. Also please note that this is a very different question to 811457, as many people (understandably) have connected the two. This question is about stick force stability, the force required to hold a different airspeed, whereas 811457 is about stick force per G, the force required to pull a particular G-force, so they are very different. Figure 1 indicates the variation of stick force with airspeed and illustrates the effect of tab setting on stick force. You can see from the graph, that dependent on EAS (Equivalent Air Speed) and trim tab setting, the stick force to hold a 1 kt change in airspeed from the trimmed speed DECREASES as the trimmed speed increases. There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Therefore, holding a 5 kt difference from 70 kts would required a greater force than holding a 5 kt difference from 100 kt. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft that has positive stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed (it is a bit more nuanced than this, but this is all we need to know here). The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (i.e. a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

Manoeuvrability is the exact opposite, it is how easy it is to change an aircraft's attitude or direction. With high stability comes low manoeuvrability (think large jet aircraft) and with low stability comes high manoeuvrability (fighter jets or aerobatic display aircraft). The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. The neutral point is the place on an aeroplane that the CG must be in front of to make the aircraft stable in a particular axis. Its location is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin. The larger the static margin, the greater the stability, (and lower the manoeuvrability). Therefore, now we know that manoeuvrability is higher with an AFT CG, and lower with a FWD CG, there is only one correct answer left.",

The lateral static stability is a measure of the airplane’s tendency to return to the wings-level attitude after a disturbance has caused the airplane to be disturbed in the rolling plane.

Static stability pertains to how a system reacts immediately when disturbed. In a statically stable system, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Manoeuvrability/controllability, on the other hand, are similar terms (not quite the same), and are the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various manoeuvres. The more stable an aircraft is, the less controllable, and vice versa. The only option that makes any sense is \"to make it easier to return to steady flight after being disturbed by an external force\" as the other options either describe low stability or fuel efficiency, which is not related.",

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime.

If the shockwaves form asymmetrically on the aircraft, whether due to different airflow patterns over the wings, small differences in the aircraft structure, control surfaces, etc., then the different drag forces can cause a yawing motion, which sets off the oscillation known as Dutch roll.

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG.

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose.",

            "explanation": "Static longitudinal stability depends upon the relationship of angle of attack and pitching moment (CM). A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

            "explanation": "Centre of Pressure (CP) is considered as the point at which lift acts through, while Centre of Gravity (CG) is the point where weight of aircraft acts through. Refer to the situation 1 in diagram: The moments have to be balanced for straight and level flight. Since the CG is forward of CP, lift (L) is producing an anticlockwise moment around the CG. To balance this anticlockwise moment from lift, we need a clockwise moment from the force of the stabiliser (F). To procedure a clockwise moment from the stabiliser, a downward force will be needed. If we take moment at the point of CG, we can establish the formula Lx=F(x+y). With rearrangement we can see that F = Lx / ( x + y) Refer to situation 2 in diagram: Now if the distance between CG and CP becomes larger than before, the new formula will become Wz + Lx = F'(x+y), if we take moment at the original GC position and F’ is the new force required from the stabiliser. With rearrangement, F’ = (Wz + Lx) / (x + y). If we compare F and F’, we can see that they share the same denominator while F’ has a larger numerator (Wz + Lx > Lx), with all parameters positive real numbers). Therefore, F’ is larger than F, which means as the distance between CG and CP becomes greater, the downward balancing force of the stabiliser becomes greater as well. (In this case) Another way to visualise the situation is to plug in some convenient numbers. If lift, distance x and y are all 1, F will be 1/(1+1) = 0.5 originally (taking moment at the CG). Now, let’s say the x is increased to 2, with other parameters unchanged. Taking moment at the new CG, F’ will be 2/(2+1) = 0.67, which is larger than 0.5 previously. Notes for further learning: This question assumes lift does not change when the distance between CG and CP increases. As the force from stabiliser becomes greater, the weight will have to be reduced in order to balance the upward and downward forces in this case.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service.

Figure 1 indicates the variation of stick force with airspeed and illustrates the effect of tab setting on stick force. To trim the airplane at point (1) a certain amount of up elevator is required, and zero stick force is obtained with the use of the trim tab. To trim the airplane for higher speeds corresponding to points (2) and (3), less and less aircraft nose-up tab is required. Note that when the airplane is properly trimmed, a push force is required to increase airspeed and a pull force is required to decrease airspeed. In this manner, the airplane would have positive stick force stability with a stable “feel” for airspeed. Irrespective of the speed or the deflection of the elevators, by modifying the forces acting on the control column such that a greater pull and push force is necessary, stick-force stability is obtained. There are two devices that achieve this aim, they are the down spring (figure 2) and the bobweight (figure 3). Either of them can be introduced in the control system between the control column and the elevators.",

Factors that contribute positively to static lateral stability include dihedral, a high wing configuration, sweepback, and a large vertical stabilizer (fin). The diagram illustrates that the fin can contribute a slight dihedral effect. When the fin is sizable, the side force generated during a sideslip can induce both a rolling moment and a significant yawing moment.

            "explanation": "The CM (pitching moment) vs alpha (Angle of Attack) graph is a graph depicting the longitudinal stability of an aircraft. As a very short explanation, the point where the line crosses the X-axis (Angle of Attack) is the trim position, where no pitching moment exists. As long as the gradient of the graph is negative, whenever the aircraft has a nose-up disturbance, the AoA will decrease to correct for this, and vice versa. That means that a negative gradient gives positive static longitudinal stability. The more negative the gradient of the line is, the stronger the stability. The line is not usually straight, it changes gradient due to the aircraft's design and window of stability. The CM vs alpha graph is affected by various things in the aircraft's design, including the locations of the wings and the shape of aerofoils, size of wings, etc. The CG location also massively affects the CM vs alpha graph, of course. The question is terribly worded, but really we only have to be able to say which factors a pilot can change in flight, and make sure that they actually do affect stability, and the CM vs alpha graph. Whilst the question is terrible, the answer isn't too bad. \"The centre of pressure, by changing the flap setting.\" Yes, the centre of pressure is one of the key factors determining the CM and it can be changed by changing flap setting, which is something we can do in the air. This would likely change the CM vs alpha graph completely. \"The neutral point, by varying alpha.\" The neutral point is a set location in the aircraft, determined by things such as the wing sizes and moment arms, and cannot be changed in flight. \"The centre of pressure, by varying alpha.\" Yes, again, the centre of pressure does affect the CM, and changing the angle of attack changes the CM and the gradient, strength of stability, etc., and is something that we can do in flight, of course. \"The centre of gravity, which influences the degree of pitching moment.\" This is where the question gets a bit more difficult. We are assuming that the pilot cannot change the CG during flight, but of course, some aircraft have trim tanks for that possibility, and we know that fuel burn does alter the CG, but not in a way the pilot can meaningfully control. The second part, the \"degree of pitching moment\" is also incredibly vague, and given the vague question, we agree that this option is incorrect.",

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

            "explanation": "Static stability pertains to how a system reacts immediately when disturbed. In a statically stable system, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Now, let's differentiate between two essential concepts: Controllability: This refers to the pilot's ability to control the aircraft using inputs. It involves the pilot's capacity to guide the airplane effectively. Manoeuvrability: This relates to the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various maneuvers. CS-23 and CS-25 are certification requirements that establish standards for aircraft design and performance. These regulations mandate that an airplane must exhibit static stability and meet specific criteria for controllability and manoeuvrability. In general, an aircraft with static stability is easier to control, and its movements are more predictable. The connection between manoeuvrability and stability is such that as an aircraft's static stability increases, an aircraft equipped with a particular size of control surfaces may experience a slight reduction in manoeuvrability. This is because static stability characterizes the aircraft's capacity to reestablish its initial position following a disturbance. In essence, a statically stable aircraft tends to oppose alterations in its attitude, which can introduce increased challenges when manoeuvring, especially in specific situations.",

The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment.

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. We see that line 3 starts off as having static longitudinal stability, as the line moves downward at first. This means that for a higher Angle of attack, a pitch down moment is induced. Towards the middle of this line, we see that the line flattens out, reducing static longitudinal stability at higher angles of attack.",

Dutch roll will occur when the dihedral effect is large when compared to static directional stability. Assymetric Nature of Shockwaves Generally, flight at high altitude will be flown at high Mach numbers by aircraft with sweepback wings. Drag increase encountered at these higher speeds is called wave drag. At and above MCRIT, the drag of the airplane wing increases rapidly and there is a large reduction of lift. If the shockwave develops earlier on wing than the other (assymetrically), the wing drops and tends to yaw creating the conditions for a coupled lateral and directional oscillation or Dutch roll. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. This means that the correct course of action following a Dutch roll is to reduce the Mach number and to descend.",

Dutch roll is an oscillatory instability associated with swept-wing jet aircraft. It is the combination of yawing and rolling motions. When the aircraft yaws, it will develop into a roll. The yaw itself is not too significant, but the roll is much more noticeable and unstable. This is so because the aircraft suffers from a continuous reversing rolling action. Dutch roll occurs when static lateral stability is strong and static directional stability is relatively weak. Yaw dampers prevent Dutch roll on swept-wing aircraft. Dutch roll is most common at high speed and high altitude. At high altitude and high Mach number, aerodynamic damping decreases. Decreasing both altitude and Mach number should increase damping and stop the oscillation.",

This means that the stick force per g must have upper and lower limits to ensure that the airplane always has acceptable control characteristics. Stick force per G is affected by factors such as the aircraft CG, airspeed, altitude. When the pilots make an input on the controls, lets say the elevators for example, this puts a pitch moment on the aircraft, which the aircraft's natural stability fights against, this is a part of what's called \"aerodynamic damping\". At high altitudes, the high TAS reduces the change in tail angle of attack for a given pitching velocity and reduces the aerodynamic pitch damping. Thus, the aircraft becomes more manoeuvrable and less stable. This means that the stick force per G decreases (a 1G increase in load factor is easier to pull through the control column). It is also worth noting for real life flying that this makes hand-flying much more difficult at high altitudes, as very small movements are required but still produce large changes to attitude.",

Please send us any further questions or exam feedback in the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The feel of an aeroplane is how much force is required to make a particular manoeuvre, often referred to in the units of \"stick force per G\" for longitudinal stability (pitch changes). Stability and manoeuvrability are intrinsically linked, in that the more manoeuvrable an aircraft is, the less stable it is, and vice-versa. Stick force per G simply measures how much force the pilot needs to exert on the controls to cause a 1G change in load factor, the higher this value, the more stable (less controllable) an aircraft is. The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability, as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. A change in mass (without a change in CG) is much more complicated. It appears that mass change has an effect on the manoeuvrability that cannot be simply stated for the average aircraft, as mass and wing loading (a function of mass) appear to have opposing effects, but with different values, and the effect of different speeds for higher masses is not accounted for anywhere in the question. As you can probably tell, this is already much too complex for the ATPL exams. This is likely why the effect of mass on manoeuvring stability/stick force per G is not on the learning objectives. It is intuitive to think that a lighter aircraft is more manoeuvrable, but that is not something that can be absolutely stated without further information, and not even something the learning objectives mention. We think that the examiner has written a question to test knowledge of CG movements, assuming that their intuition on the change in weight is correct, but has ended up making a question much more complicated, which ventures outside the learning objectives. Therefore, our new recommendation here would be to answer the question assuming that the weight reduction decreases the stick force per G, even though that is not an absolute statement. This leaves us with the answer \"The stick force per g is reduced since the aeroplane is lighter, but the forward CG makes this reduction less noticeable to the pilot.\"",

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, though, if the aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then the aircraft will start to roll more wings level, decreasing the rate of turn when they release the controls, decreasing the airspeed and starting to loosen the spiral, so all these parameters decrease.",

            "explanation": "This is a very complex question, but the answer is the simplest one present. The examiner has put in a lot to try and confuse you. The answer to the question is right at the top, but keep reading if you want to know more and if you want to know why the other answers are incorrect. Directional stability (stability in yaw) and lateral stability (stability in roll) are very well linked. The linkage between the two is via sideslip, the condition where the aircraft is not pointing in the same direction it is travelling through the air, so the relative airflow is arriving from one side of the nose, rather than straight on the nose. We can cause this by not flying the aircraft properly, and by flying uncoordinated, so using the ailerons without also using correct rudder, and vice-versa. LATERAL/DIRECTIONAL STABILITY Imagine that we have a left sideslip, so the aircraft is pointing forwards, but travelling to the left of that, and the relative airflow is hitting the left windshield first. A directionally stable aircraft will naturally yaw into this (nose left moment), because of the positively stable effect of the fin (vertical stabiliser), any rear strakes or ventral fin, the differential drag of the wings, etc. A laterally stable aircraft will roll away from this sideslip (right bank moment), due to the dihedral effect, sweepback, high wing effect, etc. Both of these movements decreases the sideslip, just in different ways; the aircraft can either yaw into it, or roll away from it. Most civilian aircraft are both laterally and directionally stable at once, in equal measure. If the stability becomes too high on one or the other, then it can cause either Dutch Roll or Spiral Instability. DUTCH ROLL Too much lateral stability and not enough directional stability can cause a periodic motion of sideslip and overcorrection which we call Dutch Roll. Imagine an aircraft with very long, dihedral wings, but a small tail fin. SPIRAL INSTABILITY The opposite of Dutch Roll, Spiral Instability is where we have too much directional stability but not enough lateral stability, which causes an increasing bank angle, with the aircraft constantly yawing further to keep the turn coordinated and ending up in a spiral dive. It is an aperiodic motion (it only happens once, not back and forth). Imagine a large tail fin and short, non-dihedral wings. So in terms of this question, we have already seen the correct answer, \"Lateral and directional stabilities interact through sideslip, which is created when using either aileron or rudder alone.\". Whilst there are other ways to create sideslip, this is a very common one. For two other options, we should mention that the rudder and ailerons are not contributors to stability. They are control surfaces, and the pilot has direct control over them. Stability has to be natural within the aircraft. If it takes a pilot to remove the sideslip, then the aircraft is not that stable. In a stable aircraft, we manipulate the ailerons and rudder against the natural stability of the aircraft design. For the final option remaining, most aircraft would enter a spiral dive under the conditions mentioned in the question (depending on the extent of the deflection). However, with stronger lateral stability, the aircraft would be able to resist the spiral dive. Extra directional stability would just make a spiral dive easier to enter. So you could say that lateral stability is too weak, but not both lateral and directional stabilities.",

Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. For this specific question, we can see that line 1 is the most longitudinally unstable aircraft and line 4 is the most longitudinally stable aircraft. With this information we can derive that the CG position is further aft at line 1 compared to line 4.",

For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment: - The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by an arm (distance from wing CP to CG). - The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm (distance from tailplane CP to CG). The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG directly affects the magnitude of the longitudinal static stability, the tailplane downforce and the stalling speed because its position determines the length of the arm of any restoring moment. A forward movement of the CG increases the positive longitudinal static stability of an aircraft but decreases the manoeuvrability and control response because the moment arm is increased in length and increases the nose-down pitching moment. Thus, the required downforce on the tailplane increases.",

            "explanation": "STABILITY Stability of an aeroplane is its tendency to return to an original point after a disruption. Manoeuvrability is the exact opposite, it is how easy it is to change an aircraft's attitude or direction. With high stability comes low manoeuvrability (think large jet aircraft) and with low stability comes high manoeuvrability (fighter jets or aerobatic display aircraft). The placement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the effect of any movement affects the tailplane more than the main wing and the rest of the aircraft, and it has a greater stabilising effect (like the fins on a dart). The \"neutral point\" is the where the CG would be for the aircraft to have NEUTRAL static stability (in pitch). If the CG is in front of the neutral point, the aircraft is statically stable in pitch. The further forwards the CG goes, the more stable the aircraft gets. The location of the neutral point is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin. The larger the static margin (forwards of the neutral point), the greater the stability, (and lower the manoeuvrability). As for the other options: \"The ratio of the tailplane’s lift coefficient to the wing’s lift coefficient.\" Incorrect as these do not include the location of the CG. \"The percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) from the leading edge to the centre of gravity.\" Incorrect. This is describing the CG location as a percentage of the MAC. \"The distance between the centre of gravity (CG) and the neutral point.\" Correct. \"The difference in angle between the aircraft’s longitudinal axis and the relative airflow.\" This is close to the angle of attack, but not exactly. Certainly not the static margin.",

At high altitude, a large high-speed jet transport aircraft will be cruising at a speed marginally above its critical Mach number, and it will have a small shock wave on the wing. If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’. Shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. As the shock wave moves aft over the surface of the wing, the CP also moves aft. This aft movement combined with the reduced downwash at the tail plane due to the presence of the shockwave will lead to Tuck Under. As we can see, from all the options, shock stall, mach buffet and tuck under only occur when operating above MCRIT (transonic speed regime). Dutch roll occurs when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) and may occur at Mach numbers below the critical Mach number.",

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient.

The rate of divergence in the spiral motion is usually so gradual that the pilot can control the tendency without difficulty. Spiral instability is normally considered less objectionable than oscillatory instability, so most aircraft are designed to be spirally unstable. With this characteristic, when the aircraft is yawed, either by the prolonged application of rudder or asymmetric power, a rolling moment in the direction of yaw occurs and the aircraft quickly enters a spiral dive. This can occur when flying at low airspeeds under asymmetric power conditions, when excessive yaw due to too much power is coupled with insufficient rudder control to balance it, and may quickly place an aircraft in a dangerous attitude.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Noticeable changes in static stability can occur at high lift coefficients (low speed). This condition is The curve of CM versus CL of this illustration shows a good stable slope at low values of CL (high speed). Increasing CL gives a slight decrease in the negative slope hence a decrease in stability occurs. With continued increase in CL, the slope becomes zero and neutral stability exists. Eventually, the slope becomes positive and the airplane becomes unstable.",

Dorsal fins are effectively an extension of the tail fin, so increase directional (yaw) and lateral (roll) stability, like the tail fin does.

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime. This is the range of speeds (At and above MCRIT) where some of the aircraft experiences supersonic airflow, but not all the aircraft does. This brings rise to shockwaves, first on the upper wing surfaces near the roots, then spreading to other areas of the aircraft. Shockwaves produce quite high drag forces, classed as \"wave drag\". If the shockwaves form asymmetrically on the aircraft, whether due to different airflow patterns over the wings, small differences in the aircraft structure, control surfaces, etc., then the different drag forces can cause a yawing motion, which sets off the oscillation known as Dutch roll. This Dutch roll would be made worse by the shockwaves forming on the faster wing, reducing lift and increasing drag to drop it down and drag it back, exacerbating the Dutch roll.",

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability (minimum acceptable stability). The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. A CG position aft of this point would produce an unacceptably low value of maneuver stability and would make the airplane difficult to fly.

Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability.

The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw.",

It is the change to the stability of an airplane with the passage of time. Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

The airplane with positive maneuvering stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. This means that with a more aft CG, a smaller force is required to achieve a given load factor.

Static Longitudinal stability is the aircraft's natural tendency when disturbed in pitch, to return to its former trimmed angle of attack without pilot input, and is desirable throughout the aircraft's complete speed range. For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment. The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by arm ‘x’. The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm ‘y’. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. If the nose-down (negative) tail moment is greater than the nose-up (positive) wing moment, the aircraft will have static longitudinal stability. NEUTRAL POINT If you consider the CG moving rearwards from a position of static longitudinal stability: - the tail arm ‘y’ will decrease and the wing arm ‘x’ will increase; - the (negative) tail moment will decrease and the (positive) wing moment will increase. Eventually the CG will reach a position at which the tail moment is the same as the wing moment. If a vertical gust displaces the aircraft nose-up, the sum of the moments will be zero and there will be no angular acceleration about the CG to return the aircraft towards its original position of equilibrium. Because there is no resultant moment, either nose-up or nose-down, the aircraft will remain in its new position of equilibrium; the aircraft will have neutral static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG when the sum of the changes in the tail moment and wing moment caused by the gust is zero is known as the neutral point.",

The sideslip angle (β) is the displacement aircraft centre-line from the relative airflow. By convention it is positive when the relative airflow is displaced to the right of the aircraft centre-line. The sideslip gives the symmetrical fin an angle of attack equal to the sideslip angle. This produces a small aerodynamic force, which, when multiplied by the distance from the centre of gravity, produces a strong restoring moment, and yaws the aircraft back to its original equilibrium position. A swept wing provides a stable contribution depending on the amount of sweepback, which increases with increase in CL (i.e. at lower IAS). This contribution is relatively weak when compared with other components. The inclination of the forward, right, wing to the relative airflow is greater than that of the rearward wing, so there is more lift and, hence, more induced drag, on the right side. The result of this discrepancy in drag on the two sides of the wing is a yawing moment to the right, which tends to eliminate the sideslip. This is a stabilizing effect, and may be important if the sweepback angle is quite large.",

There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft has stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed. The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

In an aircraft, it may be achieved manually, by an electrohydraulic system, or by aerodynamic means. This type of damping is dependent on the viscosity of the air for its success. The denser the atmosphere, the faster the unwanted movement will be extinguished When we make a control input, for instance a roll to the right, there is a resistance against this input due to \"aerodynamic damping\", which in this case, is where the down-going (right) wing gains an increased angle of attack as it is travelling down slightly, changing the relative airflow. This increases the lift slightly and resists the roll a little. This effect is influenced by air density, and in the low density of higher altitudes, the aircraft is travelling at a higher TAS, which means that the angle of attack change is smaller. This is a reduction in aerodynamic damping. All the control axes have natural aerodynamic damping in some form. which are reduced at high altitude. At an ISA altitude of 40 000 ft, aerodynamic damping would be reduced to one-half the ISA sea level value. High altitude, and consequently low density (high TAS), reduces aerodynamic damping, and therefore reduces dynamic stability on all axes.",

It is positive when the relative airflow is to the right of the longitudinal axis and negative when the relative airflow is left of the longitudinal axis. An airplane has directional static stability if, when in a sideslip with the airflow coming from the left initially the nose tends to yaw left. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The lateral static stability is a measure of the airplane’s tendency to return to the wings-level attitude after a disturbance has caused the airplane to be disturbed in the rolling plane. Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the right with a negative sideslip angle, nose to the right. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL. This is an oscillation involving roll, yaw and sideslip. Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability. With a dominant lateral stability this will, when a yaw is introduced, roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into the wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. The CG position has little influence on the lateral stability, but an aft CG will reduce the directional stability because the Moment Arm of the stabilizing moment from the fin will decrease and thus increasing the likelihood of a Dutch roll. To reduce the aircraft tendency to Dutch roll, either the lateral stability should be decreased or the directional stability increased => anhedral would decrease the lateral stability. Aircraft with a tendency to Dutch roll are also fitted with yaw damper. This automatically displaces the rudder proportional to the rate of yaw to damp out the oscillation. Note: Dutch roll is a result of high Lateral stability with relatively low Directional stability. Furthermore, Longitudinal stability is not a factor.",

We can think of stability like a dart, the further forward the mass, and the further backwards all the aerodynamic bits (the fins), the more stable an aircraft is. This is why a dart is very nose heavy. This shows us that the further forward the CG, the greater the stability. Each component has its own effect on aircraft stability, in each axis. So the fuselage's effect actually depends on the fuselage and CG position, but it usually destabilising, due to the large nose that sticks out ahead of the CG, but the tail fin (vertical stabiliser) is massively stabilising, because it is a large aerodynamic surface at the rear of the aircraft. Shifting the CG backwards makes the whole aircraft more tail heavy, which reduces the stability of every element of the aircraft, and reduces the overall stability in every axis except lateral (roll), therefore including directional (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch).",

Yaw is more difficult: as pilots we could refer to it in terms of heading (right is positive again here), but that would not be useful for aerodynamic calculations, so instead we use the sideslip angle. Sideslip angle (β) is the displacement angle of the airplane’s longitudinal axis in azimuth from the relative airflow. If the relative airflow comes from the right of the aircraft, that means a positive sideslip (+β), and if the relative airflow is from the left of the aircraft, that is negative sideslip (-β). The actual yawing moment (cn) of an aircraft is then considered a positive yawing moment (+cn) if it is to the right, or a negative yawing moment (-cn) if it is to the left.

It is the change to the stability of an airplane with the passage of time. Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

Both of these will increase the lift on the low wing, and restore the aircraft to level flight, hence the high static lateral stability of swept wing aircraft. We also know that if you increase the lift, you increase the drag. So, it will have a slight tendency to yaw into the relative airflow (as there is more drag on the low wing), thereby contributing to static directional stability.

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient.

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope.

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point may be imagined as the effective aerodynamic center of the entire airplane configuration, i.e. with the CG at the neutral point, all changes in net lift effectively occur at that point and no change in pitching moment results. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment.

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability affects many aspects of its flight characteristics. For an aircraft to be considered statically stable, it must initially begin to return to its original position/orientation after some sort of displacement. Think of placing a ball in a bowl, it will always begin to roll back to the bottom of the bowl, the equilibrium point. An aircraft can have stability in all three axes, pitch (longitudinal stability), yaw (directional stability) and roll (lateral stability). The opposite of stability is manoeuvrability, and if the aircraft is very stable, it is not very manoeuvrable, and vice-versa. The less stable (more manoeuvrable) we make an aircraft, the more easily it will change orientation. This is why aerobatic aircraft have very light controls, meaning that even small stick forces will cause a large aircraft movement, whereas stable aircraft, such as transport jets, are very stable, and will require much larger stick movements, and more stick force, to provide the same amount of aircraft movement. This is called stick force stability, which is a measure of how much input force is required to cause a 1G change. This question is asking about stick displacement, but it is largely the same thing. It is the reason that you would not want to cruise a highly aerobatic aircraft for long distances, as the fineness of control is difficult to achieve when the controls are so light and tiny movements cause huge changes. To answer the question, if small movements of the stick create large pitch/roll changes, the aircraft must be highly manoeuvrable. Interestingly, modern fighter aircraft, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, are designed to be statically unstable for highest manoeuvrability, and have very responsive fly-by-wire controls making sure that the aircraft does not become unstable during flight. Excellent for air-to-air combat, terrible if they lose their FBW system.",

Another way to think of this is that on approach, the runway will be out of the right hand side window, even if there is no crosswind. Wing sweep will help increase lateral stability. When a swept-wing airplane is sideslipping, the wing toward the sideslip will experience a higher velocity normal to the wing's leading edge than the wing away from the sideslip. More lift is generated on the wing toward the sideslip and a roll moment arises that tends to diminish the bank angle or sideslip and return the airplane to equilibrium. In this case, the airflow over the right wing becomes straighter (less swept). Straighter wings are effectively longer, so produce more lift, resulting in a larger rolling moment to the left returning the aircraft to a non-sideslipped condition. This is an example of positive lateral stability.",

Learning Objective 081.04.04.05.01: Describe how the following aeroplane components contribute to static directional stability: wing; fin; dorsal fin; ventral fin; angle of sweep of the wing; angle of sweep of the fin; fuselage at high alpha; strakes. The vertical stabiliser (tail fin) of an aircraft is the main contributor to static directional stability (stability in yaw), as any sideslip angle will create a lift on the fin by introducing an angle of attack to its symmetrical aerofoil, which then will create a force on the aircraft to point into the relative airflow. From here on out, we are using the words, \"positive effect\" (on stability) to mean that it makes the aircraft more stable. The larger we make the tail fin, the larger the positive effect (on stability). Also, the further back we make the tail fin from the centre of gravity, the larger the moment arm of the force, so the larger the positive effect. For this question, we must remember that the fin is just a wing, but when we fly coordinated (no sideslip), it is a symmetrical aerofoil, so creating no lift in either direction. Introducing a sideslip (an angle of attack - AoA) causes a lift force to be made. The greater this force, the greater the \"positive effect\" on stability, which pushes the tail around so the nose points towards the relative airflow. Sweepback of a wing does a few things, it increases the MCRIT of the aerofoil by making it \"effectively thinner\", which is very useful for high speed flight. It also changes the low speed flying characteristics a lot, decreasing the coefficient of lift for each angle of attack, but increasing the critical (stalling) angle of attack (but with a lower maximum lift output). This last bit is particularly useful for aircraft. Swept back tail fins will remain useful at higher angles of sideslip before stalling, in comparison to straight fins. Increased sweepback of the tail fin usually has a negative effect on directional stability (stability in yaw). At low/medium sideslip angles, the reduced lift coefficient for each angle of attack produces less of a restoring force (the lower gradient on the graph above). It is important to note that at higher angles of attack, within a certain range, a straight fin will have stalled (so provides almost no stability) and the swept fin would not yet have stalled due to its higher stalling AoA, and in that case, the swept fin provides far more stabilising effect than a straight fin, but only within a certain range of large sideslip angles.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating.

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. If an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection, as the forces on the tailplane often are deflected downwards.",

The airplane with positive maneuvering stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. A CG position aft of this point would produce an unacceptably low value of maneuver stability and would make the airplane difficult to fly. For transport airplanes the aft limit is normally located at approximately 30% of the MAC.",

Dorsal fins are effectively just an extension to the main fin, extending forwards to provide some benefits such as the blending with the fuselage, reducing drag, providing better stability at high sideslip angles, etc. They therefore have a positive effect on directional and lateral stability. Ventral fins (sometimes called strakes), however, are placed under the fuselage, and provide a further increase in directional stability (yaw), but have the opposite effect to the main and dorsal fins when it comes to lateral stability, they are de-stabilising. Ventral fins are very useful for improving the stall/spin characteristcs of aircraft where the fuselage and wings may render the main fin less effective at high angles of attack (similar to a deep stall, but for stability). Their main limitation is ground clearance. None of these items have any effect on longitudinal stability, which is stability in pitch, as a pitch change will not cause any angle of attack change to these components. Some ventral fins/strakes are actually angled outwards, so they are not perfectly vertical. Now this would give very slightly increased longitudinal stability due to their location at the rear of the aircraft, however, the majority of ventral fins (as is the primary intention of them) have no effect on longitudinal stability.",

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability, and in particular its longitudinal stability (stability in pitch) is massively dependent on the location of the aircraft's Centre of Gravity (CG). As long as the CG is in front of the \"neutral point\", the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. The \"neutral point\" is a sort of average Centre of Pressure (CP) for the whole aircraft, and it goes towards where there are more aerodynamic surfaces. Think of a throwing dart, the front had a weight and the back has a set of fins, therefore a very far forward CG and a far back \"neutral point\". This is a very stable system. A far forward CG therefore is a more stable condition. This also means a less manoeuvrable condition. Less manoeuvrability means that the pilot will have to push and pull harder on the controls to achieve the same result, as the control surfaces need to move further to achieve the same angular change. The controls feel \"heavier\" with a further forward CG, but the aircraft is more stable. This can be counteracted by the Fly-By-Wire system, which uses the knowledge of the aircraft's weight and CG position to estimate the required control surface deflection, and make the controls feel the same as for any other CG position, so the pilot has the same control of the aircraft, no matter the weight or CG position. If the CG is further forwards, the FBW system will amplify the pilot's inputs more than normal in the pitch axis, to make the aircraft control as it would do \"normally\". This means that, in this scenario, the pilot has entered an artificially far forward CG, so the FBW system will amplify the pilot's actions in pitch, but without any need to do so, as the CG is not actually that far forward. This could lead to overcontrolling of the aircraft by the fly-by-wire system, as the aircraft is not as stable as the FMS/FBW believes. The overcontrolling could potentially reduce the stability of the aircraft, or even cause instability. As this question is easy to misread or misunderstand, we will quickly go through each option: \"Due to the design criteria applied, the longitudinal stability of the aircraft is always ensured, irrespective of the location of the CG.\" Whilst this looks plausible, the longitudinal stability is not ensured (and will be reduced or removed) when the CG goes out of the aft limit. \"The actual longitudinal stability is lower than calculated by the FBW system, and the system may allow for control surface deflections that result in instability.\" As mentioned above, this is correct, due to the incorrectly entered CG position, which may allow the FBW to overcontrol the aircraft. The aircraft is less stable than the FBW system believes. \"The aircraft consumes more fuel than expected during the cruise phase of the flight, as the FBW system deflects the horizontal stabiliser more to counteract the error of the pilot.\" The aircraft will actually consume less fuel than expected, but because the aircraft expects a forward CG in the cruise, which causes the tailplane to produce more downforce, and requires more lift from the wing, causing higher drag. However, the aircraft actually has a further aft CG, so will burn less fuel than expected. This is also not connected to the FBW system creating larger deflections, that is an effect which would occur in this case, but has negligible effect on fuel consumption. \"The pitch rates commanded by the FBW system are lower at higher altitudes compared to the pitch rates required to ensure that the longitudinal stability remains positive.\" This has nothing to do with the scenario mentioned in the question (incorrectly inputted CG location).",

The larger vertical fin increases the surface area available to resist the yawing moment caused by asymmetrical thrust, crosswinds, or other factors that could cause the aircraft to turn left or right. This results in improved directional stability of the aircraft, which means that it is less likely to deviate from its intended course. Therefore, option \"Positive, since the higher vertical fin.\" is the correct answer. The increased size of the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer should not reduce the effectiveness of the rudder, as the rudder is the primary control surface for yaw control.

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is almost trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, then, if the aircraft's rate of turn, rate of descent and speed are all decreasing, then it is naturally rolling out of the turn, and is therefore stable in the spiral (dive) mode.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Noticeable changes in static stability can occur at high lift coefficients (low speed). This condition is The curve of CM versus CL of this illustration shows a good stable slope at low values of CL (high speed). Increasing CL gives a slight decrease in the negative slope hence a decrease in stability occurs. With continued increase in CL, the slope becomes zero and neutral stability exists. Eventually, the slope becomes positive and the airplane becomes unstable.",

Please send us any further feedback in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The yaw damper's main purpose is to prevent Dutch roll. Basically speaking, Dutch roll is a series of out-of-phase turns, when the aircraft rolls in one direction and yaws in the other due to a high amount of lateral stability but not quite enough directional stability. When the yaw is introduced, the strong “dihedral effect” will roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. Since the possibility of a Dutch roll increases with increasing altitude due to the lower aerodynamic damping at high altitude, aircraft can sometimes be restricted to fly at lower altitudes only when the yaw damper is unserviceable.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG.

The change in lift (side force) on the fin creates a yawing moment about the centre of gravity which tends to yaw the aeroplane into the relative airflow. The magnitude of the fin contribution to static directional stability depends on both the change in fin lift and the fin moment arm. The lift curve slope of the fin determines how sensitive the surface is to change in angle of attack. While it is desirable to have a high lift curve slope for the fin, a high aspect ratio surface is not necessarily practical or desirable due to: - Bending - Lower stalling angle - Hangar roof clearance The stall angle of the surface must be large enough to prevent stall and subsequent loss of effectiveness at expected sideslip angles. Sweepback or low aspect ratio increases the stalling angle of attack of the fin and reduces the lift curve slope, therefore reducing static directional stability.",

In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point may be imagined as the effective aerodynamic center of the entire airplane configuration, i.e. with the CG at the neutral point, all changes in net lift effectively occur at that point and no change in pitching moment results. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. As seen in figure 1, neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment. The further aft the neutral point is from the CG the greater is the static longitudinal stability.",

The aeroplane with positive manoeuvring stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”.

If this movement is the result of an undesirable disturbance, then the ability of the airplane to return to its original heading without the assistance of any control-surface movement is a measure of its directional static stability. It is a measure of the aircraft’s ability to realign itself with the relative airflow. An airplane has directional static stability if, when in a sideslip with the airflow coming from the right initially the nose tends to yaw right. The drag of a swept wing is less than that of an unswept wing. The advantage of this type of wing at high speeds is gained at the expense of its poor performance at low speed. The drag experienced with a swept wing is the component of the relative airflow at 90◦ to the line joining the aerodynamic center of the wing, which if the wing has parallel leading and trailing edges will be the normal to the leading edge of the wing. In figure 1 the normal component of the relative airflow is greater on the port wing than the normal component on the starboard wing. The drag on the leading wing, the port wing, in figure 1 is of greater magnitude than that of the trailing starboard wing because of its decreased effective sweep angle. It is therefore a stabilizing influence. Positive sweepback has a stabilizing effect on directional stability because the CP is further aft, and the stalling angle is increased. The significance and magnitude of this effect on directional static stability is directly proportional to the angle of sweepback.",

The greater the tail moment relative to the wing moment, the greater the rate of acceleration towards the original equilibrium position. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. STICK FORCE STABILITY (STICK FORCE PER G) (figure 2) The force on the stick required to change the aircraft's load factor by 1 G. One of the biggest factors for changing stick force stability is the change of stability from a movement of the CG. Moving the CG forwards increases the stability of the aircraft, thereby reducing manoeuvrability, and increasing stick force stability, as seen by the steeper line on figure 2 when the CG is at 10% MAC (far forward CG = higher stick force per G). The change in mass on its own causes an unknown change to the stick force per G without in-depth analysis into the particular aircraft (so we assume no change), and the only change in stick force stability comes from the CG movement.",

The rolling force overcomes the weak dihedral effect, allowing further roll. As the vertical component of lift decreases, the relative wind has an upward component with the airplane swinging in alignment with the air stream, the nose begins to drop.

When a wing drops, due to a disturbance, the tendency of the aeroplane to correct this departure from the balanced condition in level flight is dependent on the lateral stability of the aeroplane. Additionally, when a wing drops, it causes other secondary motions to be initiated. The fin and rudder tend to yaw the aeroplane into the airflow in the direction of the dropped wing. Because of the yaw, the higher wing on the outside of the turn is travelling faster than the lower wing and develops a greater amount of lift. This generates a rolling moment in the opposite direction to the correcting moment of the dihedral and if the rolling moment is greater it will tend to increase the angle of bank. If the rolling moment is of sufficient magnitude to overcome the correcting force, produced by the dihedral and the damping yaw effect, the bank angle will increase and the aeroplane will enter a steadily steepening spiral dive. This is spiral instability that can be described as a combined lateral and directional aperiodic motion.",

A dorsal fin is a small aero foil, of very low aspect ratio, mounted on top of the fuselage near the rear. A ventral fin is mounted below. If the aircraft is yawed to the right, the dorsal and ventral fins will create a side force to the right. The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service. While dorsal and ventral fins contribute positively to directional static stability, a dorsal fin contributes positively to lateral static stability, while a ventral fin is destabilizing in this mode and has no effect on longitudinal stability.

Static Longitudinal stability is the aircraft's natural tendency when disturbed in pitch, to return to its former trimmed angle of attack without pilot input, and is desirable throughout the aircraft's complete speed range. The control forces of the aeroplane should reflect the stability of the aeroplane and provide suitable reference to the pilot for precise control of the aeroplane. When the CG position of the aeroplane is fixed, each elevator position corresponds to a particular trim lift coefficient. As the CG is moved aft, the slope of this line decreases, and the decrease in stability is evident by a given control displacement causing a greater change in trim lift coefficient. This is evidence that decreasing stability causes increased controllability and, of course, increasing stability decreases controllability. For the same value of CL, a more stable aircraft (forward CG) will require a higher elevator deflection. If the CG is moved aft until the line of trim CL versus elevator deflection has zero slope, neutral static stability is obtained.",

In this case the outside wing will generate more lift as it travels faster. This tends to roll the airplane in the direction of the yaw. The rolling force overcomes the weak dihedral effect, allowing further roll. As the vertical component of lift decreases, the relative wind has an upward component with the airplane swinging in alignment with the air stream, the nose begins to drop.

Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

This means that if the CP is in front of the CG, the nose wants to move upwards. To cancel this movement, the tailplane generates an upwards moment to keep the nose straight. In this case, the CP is located ahead of the CG. To have the nose not move upwards, an upwards moment has to be created by the tailplane, so the tail comes up again and the nose goes down to a 0 angle.",

            "explanation": "This question is unnecessarily long and wordy, but does give some hints which help to remove incorrect options quickly. Static stability pertains to how a system reacts immediately when disturbed. In a statically stable system, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Manoeuvrability, on the other hand, is the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various manoeuvres. Stability and manoeuvrability are effectively opposite, and the greater an aircraft's stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, and vice-versa. An aircraft with a further forward CG has greater stability (but lower manoeuvrability) and aircraft with aft CG locations have lower stability, but higher manoeuvrability. Higher weight also tends to reduce manoeuvrability, but this rule isn't always as simple as the CG locations. The question tells us that stability is affected by the CG location and the gross weight of the aircraft, and, knowing that manoeuvrability and stability are closely (and inversely) linked, that hints to us that those factors also affect the manoeuvrability, which they do. That removes the following options: \"cannot be affected by the pilot or operator as it is determined by the aircraft design.\", as the CG location and weight can be affected by the operator/pilot, so therefore, the manoeuvrability can be too; and \"is determined by the size of the control surfaces only, not the CG position or the weight.\", as the manoeuvrability is changed by the CG location and weight. The other options can be chosen between based on the CG location and weight, and the effects of those mentioned above.",

The term controllability refers to the ability of the aircraft to respond to control surface displacement and achieve the desired condition of flight. Adequate controllability must be available to perform take-off and landing and accomplish the various maneuvers in flight. A contradiction exists between stability and controllability. A high degree of stability gives reduced controllability. The relationship between static stability and controllability is demonstrated by figure 1 and 2. The effect of increased static stability (forward CG movement) on controllability is illustrated by the ball in a steeper trough (figure 2). A greater force is required to “control” the ball to the same position of displacement when the static stability is increased. In this manner, a large degree of static stability tends to make the aircraft less controllable. It is necessary to achieve the proper proportion between static stability and controllability during the design of an aircraft because too much static stability (forward CG position) reduces controllability. The forward CG limit is set to ensure minimum controllability.",

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

When a significant sideslip is induced, a stable aircraft will want to yaw very towards the oncoming airflow direction, and in a balanced aircraft, would also roll away from the oncoming airflow direction. However, the aircraft's roll would not be as strong in this scenario, and the strong yawing effect may even overpower it, which would cause the aircraft to yaw and roll towards the oncoming airflow. This intense yawing effect basically overpowers the other aspects of stability and makes the aircraft bank in the same direction, which forms a spiral dive. Spiral dives can make the aircraft speed up very quickly and can cause overspeed or overstress if not dealt with quickly, as they get worse with time. Spiral dives are referred to as \"aperiodic\" motion as they do not go back and forth (like dutch roll), they only happen once, getting further from equilibrium. The key part of this question is that spiral dives are always pointing downwards, as they are a dive. If the nose was upwards, they would be a stall/spin.

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

            "explanation": "When density altitude decreases, the air gets \"thicker\", meaning that there are more air particles per cubic metre, and therefore more air particles will hit our aircraft and flow over its wings per mile flown. This would increase lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but descend in the atmosphere, the higher air density means that we have to fly slower to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is a decrease in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with decreased altitude. As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with a decrease in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the left, due to the decreased TAS for the same IAS at lower altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 2, moving to the left.",

Given other questions in the database which have been confirmed, we have decided to change the options to make one \"actually correct\", rather than the very questionable previous options, which were never fully verified. This question could have even been removed from EASA's database by now, but we also cannot guarantee that. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect of spoilers on the critical angle of attack is much more complex (and explained where necessary in different questions), and unpredictable, but EASA appear to say that it increases with spoiler deployment (opposite to how it decreases when trailing edge flaps are deployed). As far as we are aware, it could actually increase or decrease slightly in real life, dependent on the wing, spoiler size and location, and particularly the amount of spoiler extension. For this question though, mercifully, the answer remains the same. ANSWERING THE QUESTION The question asks about the angle of attack of the wing. When spoilers are extended, the lift decreases, so without any change to the angle of attack, then the aircraft will no longer be in equilibrium, so in reality, to counteract weight, the angle of attack of the wing has to increase. This agrees with our experience of flying jets, in when we extend spoilers, the aircraft pitches up slightly. The margin to the stall is a very vague term, as it could mean the difference between current speed and stall speed, but it is more likely to mean in terms of angle of attack, and in this case, would probably be the difference between the aircraft's current angle of attack and the critical angle of attack (AoA). When spoilers are extended, the actual AoA is forced to increase to maintain the flight path, and the critical angle of attack will either decrease slightly (according to some other sources) or increase slightly (according to EASA's other questions), but either way, the increase in current AoA will likely be much greater, so the margin to stall will decrease.",

Therefore, being close to the ground decreases downwash and decreases induced drag. This is called ground effect. Ground effect increases as an aircraft flies closer to the ground, so the lowest height would give the lowest induced drag. Obviously then, the highest induced drag would occur when at the greatest height above the ground. Ground effect is usually cited as taking effect at approximately half the wingspan of height (which would be 30 ft here), as that is when it becomes significant and noticeable, but as with everything in aerodynamics, it is not a binary effect (on or off), it is a gradual change, so the correct answer here is simply the greatest height.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above and left of the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below and right of the origin.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V2) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. A big consideration for this question is the scenario. We are at the critical AoA and we raise the speedbrakes. Of course, we will begin to descend as the drag increases, unless we add thrust. if we don't do either of these things then the aircraft will quickly stall, but initially, assuming the angle of attack remains constant, the speedbrake extension should slightly delay the stall to a higher AoA.",

            "explanation": "\"By fitting winglets to the wing tip, the strength of the wingtip vortices is reduced, which in turn reduces induced drag.\" Correct. Winglets are small vertical aerofoils that are integrated into the wingtip. These generate a slight forward force and disrupt the airflow from the lower to the upper surface of the wing, diminishing the intensity of the wingtip vortex. Both effects contribute to a reduction in induced drag. Let's examine the remaining options and discuss why they are incorrect: \"Slat extension, at a constant angle of attack and normal extension speeds, will increase the lift coefficient, which will also increase the induced drag coefficient.\" Incorrect. At a constant aircraft angle of attack, the extension of slats decreases the angle of attack on the specific wing section, preventing an increase in the lift coefficient (CL). The advantage of slats becomes evident when the aircraft's angle of attack is subsequently increased. \"Sweepback reduces drag since, compared with a straight wing of equal area, the span increases.\" Incorrect. Sweepback actually reduces the wingspan, thereby lowering the aspect ratio and increasing induced drag. \"Vortex generators on the wing partially block the spanwise flow over the wing, leading to a reduction in induced drag.\" Incorrect. Vortex generators are designed to energize the boundary layer, but they typically contribute to increased drag rather than inducing a reduction in induced drag.",

This can help the aircraft take off with a shortened ground roll, as the aircraft generates more lift at a lower speed with flaps and slats extended. However, flaps and slats shorten the ground roll, but also decrease climb performance as they generate drag. Therefore, after takeoff these two devices are retracted. Flaps and slats both decrease stall speed, but flaps generate much more drag. The flaps are therefore retracted first and slats afterwards. Flaps increase CL for a specific angle of attack, giving a wing with flaps extended a higher CL and therefore higher lift than a wing without. Flaps also increase CLMAX and the CD for a wing, they decrease critical AoA. Slats do not necessarily increase CL for a specific AoA, but they increase the value for CLMAX, meaning that the aircraft stalls at a much higher AoA than normal. They also increase the drag a little on the wing where they are extended. Flaps increase lift, but this question states straight and level flight. If we want to remain in level flight, lift should not be increased because otherwise the aircraft will climb. Therefore the AoA will have to be decreased and the CL will remain the same, drag will increase and CLMAX will be increased. Note: Drag and Lift stay constant. At straight and level flight which means Lift=Weight (constant). IAS is said to have remained constant as well. Remember the lift and drag formula.",

Air comes in under constant pressure (which we will call X from this point onwards) and is directed through the tube. At a certain point in time, the tube starts becoming tighter. However, the same amount of air still has to travel through this (now tighter) tube (we call this airflow Y). It does so by flowing faster than before. This increased airspeed creates a lower pressure at the tighter part of the venturi, while the wider part still has its original pressure and airspeed. After the tightening, the tube becomes wider again and the air returns to its original static pressure and airspeed (airflow Z). It now has the properties of airflow X again. Before the venturi (airflow X) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal In the throat (airflow Y) Total pressure same as airflow X and Z Static Pressure low Speed of the airflow increased After the venturi (airflow Z) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal The venturi works on Bernoulli’s principle. Bernoulli’s principle states that in increase in speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the fluid’s static pressure. The formula for this principle = Total pressure = static pressure + dynamic pressure. If airspeed increases, the static pressure decreases and dynamic pressure increases, keeping total pressure the same.",

This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, the lift decreases when leaving ground effect, and this is more prominent on a low-wing aeroplane where the wings are naturally much closer to the ground.",

In this form, the options are quite vague and we could discuss which is correct for a long time and likely never reach an answer. Therefore, we have used our experience with the authorities to give our \"best guess\" of their correct answer. Obviously, the question could well be better worded in the real exam and with good knowledge of this subject, would likely be much easier to answer. Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, any differences you noticed from our version, and if you have any idea of the correct answer with your exam authority, thank you! Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and improve slow flying characteristics. There are both leading edge devices (LE flaps, kreuger flaps and slats) and trailing edge high lift devices (TE flaps of many kinds). Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly slower, and they do this by increasing the CLMAX of the wings, so that the lift will be enough to counteract weight, even at lower airspeeds. The greater the CLMAX becomes, the lower the stall speed. Secondary effects are increased drag and a change to the wing's chord line and angle of incidence, allowing the aircraft to fly with different pitch attitudes, which can be useful for pilot vision during landing. Let's go through the options now. \"Leading edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than trailing edge flaps because they enhance the wing’s curvature, increasing lift at lower speeds.\" This is not strictly true. Whilst leading edge flaps do enhance the wing's curvature, so do trailing edge flaps, and they both increase the maximum available lift at all speeds. \"Trailing edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than leading edge flaps by increasing the wing area and camber, enhancing lift.\" This is also very difficult to justify, as their increase in CLMAX depends on the TE/LE flaps used and to what degree. Also, not all flaps increase the wing area, only fowler flaps and some variations upon them. Again, TE and LE flaps both increase CLMAX. \"Both leading edge and trailing edge flaps have the same effect on reducing stall speed by equally increasing the wing's lift capabilities.\" For us, this seems most likely to be correct. They both reduce the stall speed by increasing the lifting capability of the wing, allowing the aircraft to fly slower before stalling. \"Equally\" is a bad word to use though, as they could definitely have a different amount of effect, but it is not for us to say if they do, or which is most \"useful\". \"Neither leading edge nor trailing edge flaps significantly reduce the stall speed; they primarily affect the aircraft's drag.\" Obviously incorrect, as they both do significantly reduce the stall speed.",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Since the climb angle is based on thrust and drag: Sin (γ) = (T – D) / W We know that we need to minimize drag as much as possible to get the best climb performance.

Flaps also change the chord line of the wing, allowing a more nose-down attitude for better pilot visibility and easier landings. Flaps increase lift by increasing the camber of the wing, and often also increasing the wing area, depending on the style of flaps. This helps the aircraft gain more lift for the same airflow. An aircraft only needs enough lift to counteract its own weight in normal operations (and a little more in turns), so there is no need for more lift, only to fly slower, with the same amount of lift. The increased drag also comes from the increased camber and wing area, as this makes the wing less efficient, with a lower lift-to-drag ratio. The steeper the flap angle, the higher the drag they will produce, and this is parasite drag, which increases with the square of the speed. As the aircraft is maintaining the same flight path angle, the lift must remain the same, which removes the answer where lift increases.",

The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed). Therefore, a sudden increase in CAS, due to something like an increase in headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a momentary increase of airspeed, which eventually recues back to the original airspeed.",

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), but this is not the answer to the question as increased drag is just a side effect, and does not allow us to fly slower without stalling.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The main factors affecting induced drag are wing planform, aspect ratio, speed, and weight/lift. The effect of planform is the principal factor affecting induced drag. The size of the wing tip vortex is directly related to the length of the wing tip chord. A rectangular planform wing produces a much larger vortex than the tapered section. This is because the longer the tip chord, the greater the spillage of air from the lower surface onto the upper surface, and the larger the wing tip vortex. In aerodynamic terms, the elliptical planform wing is the most aerodynamically efficient because the downwash remains constant across the complete wingspan, giving minimal induced drag.",

CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. An increase in CLMAX will reduce the stall speed. LEADING EDGE SLAT A slat is a small auxiliary aerofoil attached to the leading edge of the wing. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed, the boundary layer is re-energized. The effect of the slat is to prolong the lift curve by delaying boundary layer separation until a higher angle of attack. The magnitude of the increase to CLMAX and the extent of the decrease to the stalling speed are directly proportional to the length of the leading edge of the aerofoil covered by the slat and the chord of the slat itself, i.e. the longer the slat the greater the CLMAX and the lower the stalling speed.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions.",

Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

The arm is the distance of the CP from a specified position. As the CP moves with the changing angle of attack, the moment about a point will also change as the angle of attack changes. On a cambered aerofoil even though the centre of pressure (CP) moves with the changing angle of attack, the lift is assumed to act through the aerodynamic centre (AC). The combination of the AC and the pitching moment coefficient are required for the analysis of the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. The tailplane is a major contributor to the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. To maintain a particular angle of attack a specific deflection of the elevator is established that will maintain this requirement. Thus, the movement of CP has an effect on both the pitching moment and stabilizer movement.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π * AR Where, CDI– Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Decreasing the speed of an aircraft maintaining straight and level flight will increase its angle of attack and therefore increase the CL.

Typical aspect ratios vary from 35 for a high-performance sailplane to 3 for a jet fighter. The aspect ratio of a modern high-speed jet transport is about 12. The effect of increasing aspect ratio on the lift curve is to decrease the overall wing angle of attack necessary to produce a given lift coefficient. Higher aspect ratio wings are more sensitive to changes in angle of attack but require a smaller angle of attack for maximum lift generation CLMAX.",

The importance of maximum lift coefficient is that the greater the CLMAX, the lower the minimum flight speed (stall speed). If an aerofoil section of greater camber is used to give a lower minimum flight speed, the efficient cruise speed will be lower due to o the generation of excessive drag. It is better to use an aerofoil section that is efficient at high cruise speed, with the ability to temporarily increase the camber of the wing when it is necessary to fly slowly. In the figure is also dipected that the CL increases with increasing Angle of Attack until the point of CLMAX, where an increase in Angle of Attack leads to a decrease in CL. In this exercice there are two airfoils: - airfoil 1 and 2 are identical, with airfoil 2 at a higher angle of attack - airfoil 3 and 4 are identical, with airfoil 4 at a higher angle of attack Airfoil 1 and 2 have a higher thickness and camber when compared to airfoil 3 and 4. From this we can conclude that: - Airfoil 3 is producing the least CL as it has the least camber, thickness and angle of attack; - Airfoil 4 produces more CL than airfoil 3 because it has a higher angle of attack - Airfoil 1 prduces more CL than the previous ones due to its camber and thickness - Airfoil 2 produces the most CL because of its camber, thickness and higher angle of attack. Knowing this, we can select the correct option: 3, 4, 1, 2.",

As for the other options, the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass. That is the point through which the weight force acts. The aerodynamic centre is a bit more complicated, as it is a point on a wing (aerofoil) where the turning force of the aerodynamic forces around it remains the same, usually at around 25% chord for subsonic flow.

Downwash can also be the change in airflow angle that wingtip vortices cause, but we don't think the question is referring directly to that. When flaps are extended, the aircraft can fly slower without stalling as the reduced airflow over the wing is being forced downwards at a steeper angle, which means the downwash angle increases, which means it still produces as much lift as the clean wing at higher speeds. This downwash can have a strong effect on the airflow hitting the horizontal stabiliser though, causing an increase pitch up moment on some aircraft, with the effect varying in strength, depending on where their wings and stabilisers are mounted.",

This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

            "explanation": "A plane can remain in the air by the wings generating lift. If this lift is equal to the weight (and the aircraft is in the air), the aircraft will remain in level flight. A wing operates through the principle of pressure differential and equal and opposite reactions. An aerofoil segment can generate lift by either having an angle of attack to the relative airflow, or but being cambered (bulging more in one direction), or both. Both these things mean that, to create lift upwards, the air flowing over the top of the wing must travel faster than the air underneath the wing, in order to provide a low pressure area above the wing due to the venturi effect. The way this occurs can be thought of through many different approaches, but it is easiest for our purposes just to say that the streamlines of air going over the wing get squashed together more than those under the wing (there is a little more to it, but we don't want to make it any more complex). The venturi effect creates a low pressure area above the wing, and the relatively higher pressure beneath the wing means that there is a net force upwards on the wing (from high to low), which is our lift. The air behind the wing is also given some downwash by this effect, and that satisfies the \"equal and opposite forces\" of Newton's 3rd law, in that the air going downwards forces the aircraft to go upwards. It is important to know that the low pressure air is the main contributor to the lifting effect, and not the \"high\" pressure beneath the wing, as that is only high relative to the low, not relative to ambient pressure.",

            "explanation": "Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Additional Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed the boundary layer is re-energised. If Kinetic Energy is added to the boundary layer, boundary layer separation will be delayed to a much higher angle of attack. In terms of the pressure distribution of the aerofoil with a slat extended, the slat provides a fair amount of lift itself due to its shape, and when extended, it flattens the peak of the low pressure zone somewhat, allowing the low pressure zone to be more evenly distributed over the top of the aerofoil. It increases the suction overall as it allows a much higher critical AoA and higher CLMAX, as the adverse pressure gradient occurs more gradually, delaying the stall. Furthermore, the suction peak flattens, it does not move. This is why the CL location does not change very much when extending flaps. Note: We are aware that the wording of the correct option here is a little off regarding the suction peak, as the peak should reduce, but the overall suction increases. We think this could be what the examiner is trying to say. We still think it is the most correct option by far out of the available options, but please send us any further feedback if you see this question in the exam, thank you!",

The formation of ice along a wing's leading edge greatly alters its aerodynamic contour and leads to premature separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50%. Lift (CLMAX) The larger the angle of attack, the larger the decrease of CL with a maximum decrease at CLMAX Drag More skin friction drag results in overall more drag and earlier boundary layer separation. In significant icing condition, ice build-up can also increase the form or pressure drag Stall Speed Due to decrease of CLMAX and increase of the aircraft weight, stall speed will increase. Critical Angle of Attack Increased surface friction results in quicker flow separation. This reduces the critical angle of attack and a stall will occur sooner. Stability The decreased CLMAX of the tailplane could cause a stal when the aircraft is flying at low speed and with an increased downwash due to flap extension. A tailplane stall will result in loss of longitudinal control. The changed CL of the main wing will create some small changes in the pitching moment.",

            "explanation": "Camber is the asymmetry between two acting surfaces on an airfoil. For an aircraft, this is the top and the bottom of the wing. Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

Typical aspect ratios vary from 35 for a high-performance sailplane to as low as 3 for a jet fighter. The aspect ratio of a modern high-speed jet transport is about 12. Aspect Ratio is the measure of Span divided by Chord. As many wing planforms have variable chord lengths, there is a second formula which uses wing area instead, which effectively just makes use of the \"average chord\". AR = b/c or, AR = b2 /S Where: AR - Aspect Ratio b - Span c - Average Chord S - Wing Area Therefore, for this wing, the aspect ratio can be calculated in a few different ways. The easiest is to just to say that the average chord is 1.25 m, and span / chord = 12.5 / 1.25 = 10. Alternatively, you can calculate the wing area as two trapeziums (or any other way) as 2 x 6.25 x ((1 + 1.5) / 2) which gets you to 15.625 m2, and then do span2 / wing area, which is 12.52 / 15.625 = 10.",

            "explanation": "The polar diagram of CL vs CD is a very common one to be used in the exams. It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. We can therefore imagine what each of the options would do to the graph, and measure that up with the annex in the question. \"Flaps\" Flaps increase our CLMAX and also increase drag, so the graph would move up and to the right, which is not the same as the annex. \"Landing Gear\" Landing Gear won't affect our lift, but they will increase drag, so the graph will move to the right only, not downwards like we see in the annex. \"Lift dumpers\" Lift dumpers such as wing spoilers reduce lift (as per their name) by ruining the airflow over the wing, and increase drag through this very same method, and by putting an obstruction in the airflow. They would cause the graph to go down and to the right, which matches up with the annex. \"Slats\" Slats allow an increase in the CLMAX as they allow for higher angles of attack to be flown, but they do not increase drag by very much, so the graph would move upwards, with perhaps a slight movement to the right near the top.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

Their main contribution is to increase the maximum lift coefficient, but not increase the lift coefficient at a certein AoA. The negative influence of extending slats is a slight increase in drag. Therefore we can say that at a certain AoA, slats will not increase lift, but they will increase drag slightly, therefore the only resultant moment will be a yaw. Flaps are aerodynamic surfaces that extended from the trailing edge of the wing. Their main purpose is to increase the camber of the wing to increase the coefficient of lift for a certain AoA. This can be seen on the figure. Their main contribution to the wing is extra lift. Whilst drag is also a side effect, lift it more significant.

When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its induced drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus upwash and downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash/Upwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash/Upwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. (So the AoA increases to maintain lift) The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. In terms of the forces on the controls, it's a tricky one to answer. The forces will change on the elevators as elevators feel the reduced downwash behind the main wings when in ground effect, giving a pitch down moment, so a pitch-up moment is expected upon leaving the ground effect. However, this is not \"lighter\" or \"heavier\" controls. We believe that there is no consistent change, but please let us know if this is marked as incorrect in the exam and we can look into changing this. The learning objectives do not mention this, but they are also quite vague on this matter so do not remove it completely.",

Parasite drag increases with the square of the speed, induced drag changes with the inverse square of the speed (highest at low speeds). Together, they create the familiar drag curve of an aircraft. Sometimes, we have to convert that graph again, from drag (thrust required) to something more friendly to propeller aircraft. Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; the power required curve will look almost the same (There is a slight flat section of figure 2 but it is not important, imagine it looks the same as the others), but for each point on the curve, the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards).

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated.

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that arrow 3 is correct. Although the lift is the larger force, the proportional increase in the drag is greater, and so the maximum lift/drag ratio decreases.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. These are obviously where the air is hitting the aircraft, and therefore some of the SCWDs will hit the airframe. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example. When it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warning that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

In the sense that increasing the angle of attack increases the wing's coefficient of lift in a mostly linear fashion, up until the critical angle of attack, when the wing stalls and any further increase in angle of attack causes a steep drop-off in lift coefficient. There is a graph to show this relationship, the CL vs Alpha (AoA) graph. The X-axis of the graph is the angle of attack (AoA) (α - Greek letter Alpha), and when the AoA is zero, a symmetrical aerofoil will not have any lift (well more precisely, it has both upwards and downwards lift of equal amounts which cancel out). However, a positively cambered aerofoil will produce some lift at zero degrees angle of attack, depending on how much camber is present. The Y-axis of the graph is the coefficient of lift (CL). This means that the graph for a symmetrical aerofoil will go straight through the origin, as 0º AoA = 0 lift, so CL = 0. A positively cambered aerofoil will have some lift at 0º AoA, so will have a line that crosses the Y axis above the origin. In this question, then, a symmetrical aerofoil's CL vs Alpha graph will cross the Y-axis and X-axis at the same point, so the question is asking about the origin of the graph, which means zero lift is being produced at that point.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "Note: Beware of the difference between lift force distribution and coefficient of lift distribution. Questions like this one have never been asked about before to our knowledge, so read the following explanation to understand the difference. The planform of a wing is a fancy way of saying the shape of the wing when looked on from above. Wings can be made in many different planforms, which all have different properties, ranging from their spanwise lift distributions to their stall characteristics, transonic flight characteristics, ease of construction, etc. Spanwise lift distribution is exactly as it sounds. It refers to the lift produced by each point on the wing, running laterally from the root to the tip. The simplest wing, a rectangular wing, has a spanwise lift distribution that is mostly flat, but drops off near the tip. This is not the most efficient planform for creating lift, as the high lift near to the tip (before the drop off) causes strong vortices, which cause induced drag. An elliptical planform, however, is much more efficient when it comes to induced drag. An elliptical planform wing has much lower induced drag due to its shape, and the spanwise distribution of the lift force starts higher, and has a more gradual drop off towards the tip. This means that much smaller wingtip vortices are formed, as there is not much lift being created around the tip. (see bottom figure in annex Now an elliptical wing is sometimes said to have a \"flat\" lift distribution, but that is referring to the coefficient of lift. The coefficient of lift of an elliptical wing stays almost constant along the whole span of the wing (top figure in annex), but because the actual chord line of the wing becomes gradually shorter towards the tip, the lift force decreases (as per the lift equation, where chord length directly influences wing area [S]). There are a few more complex reasons why this is so good for reducing induced drag, but we are not going to go into them. We are frankly surprised that the examiner has gone this far into the technicalities of wing planforms, as they have previously used greater oversimplifications.",

            "explanation": "NOTE: This answer is backed up by the most recent feedback from both Poland and Slovakia. Whilst we believe that it is not completely correct (it is only the case for normal ranges of flight, but not some possible scenarios), it is still mostly correct, and better than the other options. We think the wording of the \"independent\" option might also disqualify it from being the most correct answer, as it refers to the AC in relation to the CP, which is the opposite of what the question asks (CP in relation to the AC). Please let us know if you see this in the exam so we can verify it, as well as which authority you sat your exam under, thank you! The centre of pressure of a wing (aerofoil) is dictated by the pressure layout around the wing. This pressure layout changes dramatically depending on the shape, angle of attack, and speed of the relative airflow. The centre of pressure is kind of the \"average\" point of the pressure layout, where the sum of all the pressures acts through on the aerofoil. It is therefore the point through which the lift and drag act. It moves, depending on the angle of attack of a wing. For a positively cambered (normal) aerofoil in standard flight, the CP moves further towards the leading edge as the angle of attack increases, up until the stall. The aerodynamic centre is slightly more complex. When you add up all the forces on an aerofoil, there will be a resultant force through the centre of pressure, and this is split into lift and drag. The centre of pressure will not have any turning force around it, only forces acting directly through it. However, every other point on the wing will have a force acting around it, imagine holding the leading edge of an aerofoil in a wind tunnel, not only would it try and pull away from you, but it would also try to twist due to these moments. There is a point where the moments (turning forces around that point) stay the same, no matter the angle of attack (for the same IAS). This is called the aerodynamic centre, and it does not move (for a range of normal angles of attack and in the low subsonic speed regime). As you can see from the figure, the CP is behind the AC, and for normal ranges of flight, this will be the case.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE The strength and size of the vortices produced by an aeroplane are dependent on the amount of lift produced. Strong vortices are produced by large transport aeroplanes that create a significant amount of turbulence behind the aeroplane along the path of the aircraft. The disturbance so caused can extend for a considerable distance and last for several minutes. This is wake turbulence that can seriously affect the controllability of following aeroplanes if they are too close. The severity of the turbulence so created is categorised to enable following pilots to assess the difficulties that may be encountered. The larger, heavier aeroplanes create the worst turbulence that will cause problems to following pilots particularly when close to the ground during take-off or landing. Pilots are advised by the aviation authorities of the minimum distance and/or time separation from the aeroplane ahead deemed to be safe, to avoid having control problems. The minimum separation distance and/or time is based on the relative sizes of the aeroplanes concerned. Wake turbulence is affected by the height of the aeroplane and the prevailing wind conditions. The downwash of the airflow behind the aeroplane causes the vortices to descend to one thousand feet below the aeroplane. However, at low height, when the aeroplane is in ground effect, the vortices move outward from the path of the aeroplane over the ground. But any cross wind between 5 kt and 10 kt will prevent this happening to the upwind vortex and will keep it on the aircraft’s track. It is particularly important during the take-off phase that the following aircraft complies with the advised separation because of this. Aircraft mass, speed, aspect ratio and trailing-edge flap setting influence the strength of the vortices. The vortex strength is greatest for heavy aeroplanes at low airspeed and in the clean configuration, which is just after rotation at take-off. Vortices only cease when the nose-wheel touches down during landing ground run.",

For subsonic flow, the air is incompressible (its density remains constant) thus, for subsonic flow: A1* V1 = A2* V2 = A3* V3 = constant. From figure 1, we can then conclude that sections with smaller area have an increase in speed. These areas are also where streamlines appear closer together. This can be used to make an analogy with an airfoil where streamlines are enclosed into a streamtube (figure 2).

The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtipsand become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared.

The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 has significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0° AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber. We can assume from the question text that the other lines represent different configurations of the same aerofoil, so our answer is symmetrical aerofoil with trailing edge flaps extended.",

If this condition holds, then the aspect ratio remains the same before and after the increase in CL. Expressing this relationship in equation form (AROLD = ARNEW) enables us to determine the new CDI by manipulating the formula for aspect ratio. The lift coefficient increased by a factor of 1.5 to maintain lift at the lower speed: New CL = 0.6 x 1.5 = 0.9 Aspect Ratio = CL2 ÷ CDI AROLD = ARNEW 0.62 ÷ 0.1 = 0.92 ÷ CDI NEW 3.6 = 0.81 ÷ CDI NEW CDI NEW = 0.81 ÷ 3.6 CDI NEW = 0.225 Alternatively, An important formula to calculate the indiced drag coefficient (CDI) is as follows: CDI = CL2 ÷ (π AR) CDI∝ CL2 From the above, we can see that CDI varies with the (change in CL)2. New CDI = 0.1 x 1.52 = 0.225",

            "explanation": "It can be seen that the contrivution to CL is very high and the greatest aong leading and trailing edge devices. In practice, they increase critical angle of attack as well. When the aircraft is at lower angles of attack (i.e. 5 degrees) the diagram shows that deployment of Trailing Edge (TE) flaps increases CL by much more than LE devices. This is because TE flap deployment increases local alpha, whereas LE devices reduce local alpha on the part of the wing where they are deployed. However, CL is still boosted a little, because LE devices increase camber and also increase the mass flow over the upper surface of the wing. This means that the airflow over the top of the wing has more kinetic energy, and the forward movement of the separation point at high alpha will be delayed. Therefore, we can increase AOA and CL beyond the point at which airflow over the wing without LE devices would have separated and we would stall. LE devices enable aircraft alpha to increase to a higher value before the stall, at which point CLMAX has a higher value than when TE flaps are deployed.",

Lift = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x CL x S Where; ρ = Air Density, V = Velocity (true air speed), CL = Coefficient of Lift, S = Wing Area. To use the formula above, we need everything in the correct units. That means that we have to convert the velocity (TAS) from knots into m/s. As 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour, we have to multiply by the amount of metres in a nautical mile (1852) and then divide by the amount of seconds in an hour (3600). Velocity = 73 kt x 1852/3600 = 37.55 m/s We are going to rearrange the formula to find the CL, and that means we need to have a value for the lift produced by the wing. As we are in straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, so we just need the weight of the aircraft. Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity (G). Therefore; Lift = Weight = 7300 x 9.81 = 71613 N Referring to the rearranged equation in the annex above; CL = (2 x 71613) / (1.225 x (37.55)2 x 49) = 1.69",

The other part is to establish a relationship between induced drag and speed. From the graph attached to this explanation, we can conclude that an increase in speed leads to an decrease in induced drag. If you refer to the second attached figure, we can conclude how the Effective Airflow, Effective Angle of Attack, and Induced Drag behave: Wing tip vortices create certain vertical velocity components in the airflow in the vicinity of the wing, both in front of and behind it. These vertical velocities strengthen upwash and downwash, which reduce the effective angle of attack. The stronger the vortices, the greater the reduction in effective angle of attack. The effective angle of attack is the actual or effective angle of attack at the aerofoil. In level flight at a given mass the lift generated is the same at all forward speeds above the stalling speed. Because the angle of attack must decrease with increasing speed the same downwash speed has less effect at a high speed than it does at a low forward speed because it has a smaller downwash vector. Thus, the downwash angle is less at higher speeds than it is at lower forward speeds. Therefore, the induced drag is decreased at high speeds.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The induced angle of attack increases. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. The CL/CD ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore the highest value of the CL/CD ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack.

This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane.",

Increases drag also over plain flaps. Used commonly on large jet aircraft for slow flight and landing (sometimes in conjunction with the fowler flaps below). Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft.",

The graph for krueger flaps is not quite a simple as but for this question it is fine to use. Slats - These are small \"extra leading edges\" that move forward in front of the leading edge of the wing, creating a small slot behind, where airflow is sped up and re-energised, delaying the stalling angle of attack without increasing the CL at normal angles of attack. Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. For this question, the slats are the only leading edge device that fit the graph perfectly, and this is a very common high-lift device to use in questions, due to the distinctive CL vs AoA graph, so be familiar with it. \"Fowler Flap\" Incorrect.

The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed).

The streamlines of air around an aeroplane just depict the path that air particles take past the aircraft in flight, so primarily front to back, and they have to move out of the way of the aircraft's fuselage, wings, tail fin, engine nacelles, etc. Any time streamlines converge (come together), the air accelerates and the static pressure drops, and any time they diverge (get further apart), the airspeed drops and the static pressure rises, which brings about pressure distributions, lift and drag forces on the aircraft. 2 dimensional streamlines around the wing cross-section are shown in the first image above, but this question is certainly asking about 3 dimensional airflow, and that gets more complicated. The main area of 3D airflow is spanwise flow over the wings and wingtip vortices, which are effectively the same thing. Because wings are not infinitely long, there has to be a wingtip somewhere, and high pressure air from under the wing can cheat the system by going round the tip and getting to the upper wing surface. as streamlines of air affect the other nearby streamlines, this means that the air under the wing has a \"spanwise\" flow outwards, and the air on top of the wing has a spanwise flow inwards. When these two flows meet at the rear of the wing, they swirl around each other, causing vortices, strongest at the wingtip and getting weaker towards the wing root. This creates a familiar wingtip vortex area as shown above. Now for the answers. None of them are very good so we have chosen the best in our opinion as the correct one. \"The streamlines typically follow the direction of the lateral axis of the aeroplane and remain attached along the entire length of the aeroplane.\" Definitely incorrect. The lateral axis goes from left to right, and the streamlines go from front to back. \"The streamlines typically follow the contours of the fuselage, but they will have a slight spanwise flow producing a lift-like force.\" Likely incorrect. They do indeed follow the contours of the fuselage, but \"spanwise flow\" means from left to right, because it is along the wingspan, and this doesn't really hold true for fuselage airflow, and doesn't really produce any such lift-like force that we can think of. \"On the entire aft section of the fuselage, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Maybe incorrect. This one depends on the wording, but worded like this, we would say it is incorrect. A corkscrew pattern around the entire aft section of the fuselage sounds like what happens behind a nose-mounted propeller, but that wasn't specified in the question. Wingtip vortices (which we suspect are the purpose of the question) cause two vortices, spiralling in opposite directions, and stray far from the aft fuselage. \"Across the entire wingspan of the main wings, the streamlines typically follow the corkscrew pattern of the wing tip vortices.\" Best answer here. The 3 dimensional flow around the wings does make somewhat of a corkscrew pattern, and it is completely because of the wingtip vortex for that wing. The spanwise component of the flow is much greater near the wingtip and very little near the wing root, but it is still there nonetheless, and after the wing becomes very much \"corkscrew-like\".",

This is the \"flow back\" ice that one of the correct statements mentions. It covers over the aerofoil and changes the shape, sometimes quite dramatically. This will decrease the critical angle of attack, and therefore the stalling speed in level flight will increase. Icing of the pitot and static ports is also a problem when dealing with icing conditions. This is why pitot and static probes are heated, to avoid any such issues. If they do become iced over, the pilots may find it difficult to know what airspeed they are flying at, and therefore may be unsure of their angle of attack, which can lead to an unexpected stall.",

Some may wonder why answer A, \"The new CL is greater than 0.38 because flaps always increase the CL.\", is not correct. It is because flaps do not always increase the CL. If we remain at the same AoA and add flaps, the CL will almost always increase, but this is rarely what we do. If we added flaps but remained at the same speed, and at the same altitude, the CL would stay the same, as none of the components in the Lift equation would have changed.

            "explanation": "GROUND EFFECT When an aeroplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low-wing aeroplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect, which is only experienced for conventional aeroplanes during the initial climb phase after take-off and the final descent phase during landing. At low airspeeds it is considered that the air is non compressible and, because of the close proximity of the earth’s surface, the upwash of air ahead of the wing is reduced. Thus, because of the diminished negative lift, the downwash over the upper surface of the wing does not have to be as large as it would be normally. This enables the aeroplane to maintain level flight at a lower than usual angle of attack, which decreases the induced drag and improves the efficiency of the wing. The consequences of operating in ground effect at a constant IAS are: - Decreased upwash and downwash angles produce smaller wing-tip vortices. - Increased Cl. - Significantly decreased induced drag coefficient; by approximately 8% at a height equal to half wingspan and reduced by considerably more at any lower height. - Decreased total drag (no effect on parasite drag). - Decreased angle of attack for a given lift coefficient. - Increased angle of attack for a constant IAS. - Decreased stalling angle of attack. - Decreased induced angle of attack. - Increased lift, if the pitch attitude remains constant. - Increased speed for a constant thrust setting. - Increased float distance on landing, if the angle of attack is constant, increasing the total landing distance. - The lift vector is inclined forward, which decreases the thrust required. - Less thrust and power are required to fly at the same speed.",

Please send us any further exam feedback you have, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The figure shows 4 types of flaps: Plain flap -The standard for many light aircraft, increases available lift and increases drag. Easy to manufacture Slotted flap - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft. So from those descriptions, we can definitely see that type 2 (slotted) flaps have a much larger available CL than type 1 (plain) flaps with less drag.",

            "explanation": "Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centerline of the aircraft. The vortices induce downwash to the airflow behind the wing, causing the lift vector to tilt rearward. The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. It is advantageous to reduce induced drag to a minimum, and this is achieved using the following design features to minimize the formation of wing tip vortices: Tapering the wing in planform toward the tip reduces the amount of air flowing from the lower surface to the upper surface, thereby reducing the size of the wing tip vortex. Washout means constructing the wing with a small amount of twist from root to tip, so that the inboard wing section is at a higher angle of incidence, and hence a greater angle of attack, compared to the wing tip. This ensures that the inner part of the wing generates most of the lift, thus minimizing the leakage of airflow around the wing tips. This reduces the size of the wing tip vortex and reduces the total amount of induced drag. Wing tip modifications reduce the leakage of airflow around the wing tip and limit the size of the vortex. Some of the more typical designs include winglets, wing tip fence and wing tip tank.",

Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square od the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.

These forces must be in equilibrium during flight. Lift must balance weight and thrust must balance drag. These forces are Lift is defined by: L = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x S x CL For a given wing area (S), if the altitude (i.e. air density) and mass remain constant then the remaining factors in the formula, the coefficient of lift (CL) and the free air velocity (IAS), are variable but have a fixed relationship. CL and IAS must change in such a manner that the total lift formula remains balanced. Lift coefficient increases with angle of attack up to a maximum (CLMAX), which corresponds to the “Critical” angle of attack. Continuing to increase the angle of attack beyond this point makes it impossible for the airflow to maintain its previous smooth flow over the contour of the upper surface, and lift will reduce. This is represented in figure 2. At a constant mass and altitude, if the IAS is increased, the angle of attack must be decreased to maintain level flight otherwise the aeroplane will climb.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA. Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. We have therefore based this answer on feedback and other questions such as 819930 and 815643, but recent feedback is scarce, so please let us know if this is different if you see it in the real exam, thank you!",

The use of flaps on take-off is to allow the aircraft to maintain flight at lower speeds, therefore using less runway whilst accelerating. After take-off, the flaps just increase the aircraft's drag, so reduce the climb capability of the aircraft. Therefore, quite early into the take-off climb, the pilots will retract the flaps, in order to accelerate further and reduce drag. If the flaps are retracted too early, the aircraft may not be flying fast enough to gain sufficient lift with a clean wing, and the aircraft will therefore stall. If the flaps are retracted too late, the aircraft may accelerate past the VFE for that flap setting (maximum speed with flaps extended). Therefore, in this question, where the pilot monitoring has retracted the flaps prematurely (early), there is a potential for the aircraft to be below the new VS, thereby stalling the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback has been a bit contradictory for this question, and it seems very new to the EASA database. Please let us know if you see this question in the exam, and anything you can remember about it. Thank you! The effect of flaps on Take-off Distance (TOD) is as follows: Initially, increasing flap setting (from no flaps) reduces the take-off distance quite significantly as the aircraft can lift-off at a lower speed, reducing the Take-Off Run. The higher the flap setting though, the longer the distance from the lift-off point to reach the screen height, due to more drag. At a certain point though, the extra drag of high flap settings becomes a problem, as the aircraft will require a little more distance to accelerate and much more distance to reach the screen height. This extra distance eventually outweighs the small reduction in lift-off speeds when using high flap settings. The trick with this question is to note that there will be a peak flap setting that provides the minimum TOD, and the manufacturer is likely to make this the maximum allowed flap setting for take-off (if not even a lower flap setting). There is effectively no reason to ever need to take-off with flaps above this setting, and single engine climb gradient would likely be much more limiting by this point anyway. Therefore, it is our opinion that the correct answer is \"Decreases, because the effect on lift-off speed is more significant than the extra drag created.\" Remember, the examiner is asking about a take-off with the maximum allowed take-off flap setting, not full flaps. It is possible the examiner may be actually asking about very high flap settings here, in which case, the answer will change to one that states that the distance increases as the extra drag outweighs the lower lift-off speed, but for now, we think that is not the purpose of this question, and if so, would require an appeal due to incorrect wording.",

Therefore, if dynamic pressure increases then static pressure decreases and vice versa. If the static pressure on one side of a body is reduced more than on the other side, a pressure differential will exist. The actual pressure distribution over the upper and lower surfaces varies with changes in angle of attack, as does the pressure differential and the amount of lift developed. As the angle of attack increases, the low pressure above the aerofoil deepens and the suction peak moves forward. This results in the lift increasing and more of the lift being generated further forward. INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, increasing the angle of attack increases CL, which increases Induced drag.",

Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

Ailerons produce adverse yaw, which is where the down-going aileron increases the camber of the wing, and acts similar to a flap, increasing lift, as it is supposed to, but also increasing drag. The up-going aileron reduces the wing camber, reducing drag. This causes an unwanted yaw towards the upward-going wing during a bank. Ailerons can also be affected by the twisting of a wing at high speeds, in an effect known as high speed aileron reversal. Adverse yaw from ailerons can be counteracted in a fe different ways: Roll spoilers. Frise ailerons. Differential ailerons. Roll spoilers are the subject of this question. Spoilers are aerodynamic devices that stick out of the top of a wing, giving a loss of lift similar to an up-going aileron and an increased drag similar to a split flap. They are used on almost all modern commercial jets. When spoilers are used as \"roll spoilers\", they are a primary flight control. They assist or replace the ailerons on the down-going wing by increasing drag and reducing lift. They use this increased drag to even out the drag of the down-going ailerons on the opposite wing, reducing or removing adverse aileron yaw.",

WINGLETS These are small vertical aerofoils which form part of the wing tip. Shaped and angled to the induced airflow, they generate a small forward force. Winglets partly block the air flowing from the bottom to the top surface of the wing, reducing the strength of the tip vortex.",

Please do let us know in the comments if you see this question in your exams, and any similarities or differences you remember about it, thank you very much. When flying outside of ground effect, wingtip vortices change the effective airflow around a wing by providing downwash behind the wing. This means that the effective airflow over the wing actually comes from slightly above where the relative airflow is ( This change in angle, where the angle of attack is split into the effective AoA (αe) and the induced AoA (αi) means that the lift from the wing is pointing very slightly rearwards, and that component becomes what we call induced drag. The induced angle of attack (αi) is the angle of attack that is lost due to the effect of wingtip vortices. When entering ground effect, the downwash caused by the wingtip vortices has nowhere to go, as the ground is in the way, so the induced angle of attack is much reduced, and more of the total angle of attack is effective angle, which increases the lift of the wing and reduces the drag significantly. This effect is greatest at the wing tip as that is where the wingtip vortices effect the most.",

Therefore when flying ice usually forms at the leading edge, however when on the ground ice usually forms on the top of the wings. Next, where does ice form on the leading edge specifically. The point where the airflow hits exactly 90 degrees on the surface is called the stagnation point. This is where water is most likely to stick to the wing and create ice. Water at the stagnation point will not be blown over the wing or under the wing because the air pushes on it at a 90 degree angle. That’s why ice always forms first at the stagnation point, then it usually spreads over the leading edge.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

We have recently made a small wording change that we believe might correspond closer to the exam, and this has changed the \"correct answer\". Beware that this answer is not confirmed, so please send any exam feedback you have to us in the comments, thank you! We can assume that \"the pilot rotates the aircraft at the correct speed and rate\" means that the pilot rotates at the VR that was calculated, and at the correct rate of rotation for a clean airframe. The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will modify the profile of the aerofoil, increase the roughness of the aircraft surface as well as increasing the weight of the aircraft. This reduction in lift and increase in drag drastically affects the flying characteristics of the aircraft. The biggest problem in this scenario is that the disturbance of the airflow causes the wing to stall at a much lower angle of attack, hence the wing has a much lower critical angle of attack, due to the ice accretion. As this is the take-off rotation, the aircraft is very quickly increasing its angle of attack, and the ice accretion could mean that it quickly passes through the angles of attack that produce lift, and past the critical angle of attack. This means that the aircraft is accelerating down the runway with a nose-up attitude, but the wings are stalled so no lift is created. Icing or any other type of contaminant does definitely NOT increase the angle of maximum CL. Any contamination degrades aerodynamic performance, by increasing Drag and decreasing Lift and ultimately by DECREASING the angle for maximum CL. As we mentioned above, this is a terrible question, and this is just one interpretation of it, so be careful whilst reading it if you get it in the exam.",

Roll Spoilers operate asymmetrically in flight whenever the control wheel rotates, assisting the ailerons in providing roll control, particularly at high airspeeds. Flight Spoilers (speed brakes) operate symmetrically about the aircraft’s longitudinal axis to increase drag, when it is required to decelerate quickly or to descend rapidly. Their deflection angle is determined from the flight deck in response to movements of a speed brake lever, typically located on the centre pedestal on transport category aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Camber is the asymmetry between two acting surfaces on an airfoil. For an aircraft, this is the top and the bottom of the wing. Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin (and generates 0 lift at a negative angle of attack). A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. If we add flaps to the clean configuration, CL will increase, but so will the drag. This degrades glide performance. The rate of descent will increase and glide range will decrease.",

            "explanation": "DOWNWASH Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow. It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the exact same thing, but there are subtle differences to how we view it in different contexts as part of the syllabus. Evaluating all possible meanings, the only correct answer is \"stronger wingtip vortices\". INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, some air tries to \"cheat\" the wing and travel around the wingtip, creating wingtip vortices that affect the lift of the rest of the wing. The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. These vortices create upwash in front of the wing and downwash behind the wing, effectively changing the local relative airflow, and therefore changing the effective angle of attack of the wing. This produces inefficiencies and means the wing's lift is produced at an angle, and some of the lift turns into drag, called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The stronger the wingtip vortices, the greater the downwash behind the wing. As part of producing a lifting force on the aircraft, a wing must force air to go downwards, to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion (equal and opposite reactions). This is referred to as downwash also, and means that the air flowing away from a wing is pointing slightly downwards, but it arrived at the wing perfectly horizontal, for instance. The amount of \"downwash\" is directly proportional to the lift produced, and therefore: Decreased lift produces less downwash. Increased dynamic pressure means higher airspeed, but has no effect on the magnitude of lift, and therefore downwash, and will actually decrease the angle of the downwash, due to more air flowing over the wing for the same lift force. This is assuming the same lift force, which we see as much more realistic than assuming a constant angle of attack or lift coefficient, etc., for these questions. Entering ground effect reduces the effect of wingtip vortices, making the wing more efficient, due to the reduced downwash (as the air cannot flow down as much due to the ground in the way).",

The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π*AR Where, CDI – Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared. So, decreasing the angle of attack decreases CL, which decreases Induced drag. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is inversely proportional to Aspect Ratio. So, as the Aspect Ration increases, the Induced Drag decreases.

Easy to manufacture Slotted flap (and multiple slotted flaps) - Lowering the slotted flaps creates a gap between the flap and the wing, allowing higher pressure air from the lower surface to flow over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. This postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Slotted flaps provide a greater increase in CLmax compared to plain or split flaps, while generating less drag. However, their design necessitates a more intricate construction process. Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft.",

            "explanation": "The airflow around an aerofoil section sets up a pressure differential between the upper and lower surfaces. The lower surface of a wing is normally at a pressure above atmospheric, whilst the upper surface is at a pressure below atmospheric. Beyond the wing tips the air is nominally at atmospheric pressure. This causes a spanwise flow of air outward away from the fuselage on the lower surface and an inward flow toward the fuselage on the upper surface. At the trailing edge of the wing, where the two flows meet, a twisting motion is imparted to the air and a series of vortices form. These are trailing edge vortices. The effect of these vortices is to create more down wash behind the wing than up wash in front of the wing. This results in the effective air flow (EAF) being inclined to the relative air flow (RAF) by an angle called the induced angle of attack (αi). Because of this local increase in induced angle of attack, the overall lift generated by a wing will be below the value that would be generated if there were no spanwise pressure differential. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. Induced drag increases with decreasing speed (for a constant lift force). This is because, as speed decreases, the downwash caused by the tip vortices becomes more significant, the rearward inclination of the lift is bigger, and therefore induced drag is higher.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

The lift coefficient multiplied by the velocity2 must equal the same value for all speeds in this scenario, so we can say: Old CL x Old V2 = New CL x New V2 New CL = Old CL x (Old V2 / New V2) New CL = Old CL x (Old V / New V)2 So therefore, the New CL is 1.22 x (1.1/1.8)2 = 0.456 As a gross error check, we have increased speed so therefore the coefficient of lift to keep the Lift force constant has decreased, which makes sense. In words, the coefficient of lift is inversely proportional to the square of the change in speed (True Air Speed).",

Flaps increase the camber (and sometimes the area) of the wing, which increases the amount of lift that can be produced by the wing, for the same IAS (indicated airspeed). They also increase the drag of the wing, by more than they increase lift. This means that the aircraft will always fly more efficiently (better L/D ratio) without flaps, hence why they are not used in the cruise, or the climb, when possible. Flaps are primarily used for take-off and landing. For take-off, we can rotate at a lower speed, using less runway, and maintain a lower flying speed on the initial climb out. For landing, we can approach at a slower speed (with a higher approach angle if necessary, due to the extra drag), and therefore land in a shorter distance. For take-off, using flaps is a trade-off between runway length and climb requirements. Flaps are bad for climbing, as they produce more drag, but they will get us off the runway earlier. Therefore, if there is a long runway and high obstacles around, lower (or no) flaps should be used, whereas a short field take-off with few obstacles should use higher flap settings. If there is a short field with obstacles, run the performance calculations carefully for both, and use whichever is better. In terms of this question, the take-off distance will obviously reduce from no flaps (clean) to some flaps, due to the lower distance to rotation, but will begin to increase again towards full flaps, as the aircraft have so much drag that even if it does leave the ground early, it will struggle to climb to the screen height. Many aircraft would not be able to sustain a climb at all with full flaps set, and the final stage of flaps often produces little extra lift than the last stage, but produces lots more drag.",

This transfers momentum and re-energises the lower layer of the boundary air, delaying the separation point to further aft along the aerofoil surface. Vortex generators are also frequently used on a swept wing to delay tip stall and improve the stall characteristics. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. For aeroplanes travelling at high subsonic or transonic speeds, vortex generators weaken the shockwave and decrease shock drag but have no diminishing effect on wing-tip vortices. Nevertheless, the vortices produced by the vortex generators diminish shock buffet and are beneficial to the aeroplane’s overall performance",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases.

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin.",

With the spoilers in their fully extended position, approximately 80% of the wing/flap lift is destroyed and the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft more than doubles.

Drag acts parallel to and in the same direction as the relative airflow (in the opposite direction to the flight path). Total Drag is sub-divided into two main types: INDUCED DRAG - the result of lift generation. PARASITE DRAG - independent of lift generation. Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: - Skin Friction Drag - Form (Pressure) Drag - Interference Drag FORM DRAG Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates. On aircraft, for example, a fairing is often fitted around a fixed undercarriage leg to reduce form drag to an acceptable level.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, can experience up to a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. When an aircraft enters ground effect, the reduced downwash changes the makeup of the total angle of attack (AoA), by reducing the induced AoA (αi), and therefore increasing the effective AoA (αe). This changes the effective angle of lift, reducing induced drag and increasing lift. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, when entering ground effect, effective angle of attack (αe) increases, due to reduced downwash.",

Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Parasite drag drag exists even if lift is not being created, (just from the airframe moving through the air). Induced drag, as the name suggests, is a drag produced due to lift.",

Your feedback is highly valued as it helps us ensure that this question aligns closely with the official version. Thank you for your input! Plain flaps (figure 1; description a) simply lowers the trailing edge of the wing, increasing camber. It finds primary application in low-speed aircraft and situations where extremely short takeoff and landing distances are not essential. When slotted flaps (figure 2; description c) are deployed, they create a gap or slot between the flap and the wing. This slot is designed to channel higher-pressure air from the lower surface over the flap, revitalizing the boundary layer. By doing so, it postpones airflow separation on the upper surface of the flap. Compared to plain or split flaps, slotted flaps offer a greater increase in CLmax while inducing less drag. Fowler flaps (figure 3; description b) operate by first moving backward and then downward. Initially, they expand the wing area and subsequently enhance its camber. Due to the combined effects of increased area and camber, Fowler flaps provide the most substantial lift augmentation among all flap types. Moreover, they generate minimal drag due to the presence of single or multiple slots and the reduction in thickness-to-chord ratio as the chord length expands. Split flaps (figure 4; description d) are located at the lower surface of the wing's trailing edge, and when lowered, they do not alter the contour of the upper surface. At low angles of attack, they provide a lift increase similar to that of a basic plain flap, but slightly more lift at higher angles. This is because the upper surface's camber remains unchanged, preventing airflow separation. However, the drag is higher than for the plain flap due to the increased depth of the wake.",

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

Downwash is the effect of a wing changing the local relative airflow (primarily due to 3D airflow and wingtip vortices). It is also the term for the air being forced downwards behind a wing as part of lift generation. The terms are very closely linked, and often refer to the same thing, in fact, but there are some differences to how we view them in different contexts as part of the syllabus. The two similar terms do not cause a problem in this question, and the correct answer remains the same. The main wing generates downwash as a by-product of lift generation; the magnitude of downwash is proportional to the lift created. Think of the momentum change in the airflow as being the 'equal and opposite reaction' to the lift force, in order to satisfy Newton's 2nd law of motion. Therefore, one can say that the greater the downwash, the greater the lift being generated by the aerofoil. If the aerofoil is producing more lift, its angle of attack will be greater, and downwash will be greater, especially towards the wingtip where vortices are stronger. If we observe a lot of downwash, we can conclude that a lot of lift is being generated.",

They do increase drag also. 2 - Kreuger flaps - The underside of the leading edge unfolds, to split the airflow much further down than the usual stagnation point, thereby forcing more air over the upper surface wing, generating higher lift and a faster boundary layer, delaying the stall. There is some drag penalty for using Kreuger flaps. 3 - Slats - The most effective high lift devices; very little increase in drag, but a much delayed stall, so the wing can have a much higher CLMAX. They achieve this by squeezing some high speed air through that slot from beneath to above the wing. The annex here is not perfectly descriptive, but we will assume that the old position is outlined only, and the new position is filled in with colour. This means that item 1 is being extended, whereas items 2 and 3 are being retracted. This means that only item 1 is increasing the CL (and in fact, even extending item 3 (slats) does not actually increase the CL really, it only increases CLMAX by delaying the stall). Note: If you get an annex just like this in the exam, it would be worth commenting or appealing based on the annex, as it is very difficult to work out which whether each is retracting or extending without any indication of what position comes first and what comes last.",

Kreuger Flaps and Slats are often used in conjunction, with Kreuger Flaps being used on the inboard section of an wing and slats being used outboard of the engine pylons, to promote root stall tendency due to the Kreuger Flaps being less effective. Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, increase CL values for all angles of attack, also increasing drag, with only a small increase in the critical angle of attack (but that varies depending on the specifics of the wing). They are less common to use on large commercial aircraft than the other leading edge devices, but are used on a few different fighter jets, amongst other aircraft types. Slats do not increase CL for normal values of AoA, instead, they just delay the stalling AoA, allowing for a higher CLMAX due to the higher critical AoA. Note: The feedback for this question has not confirmed the correct answer, and we have had to make a few educated guesses whilst creating the annex from limited feedback. Please let us know if you see this in the exam, and any differences you can remember, as well as if you got it correct/what the correct answer is, thank you!",

CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. LEADING EDGE HIGH LIFT DEVICES There are two forms of leading edge high lift device commonly in use: the leading edge flap and the leading edge slot or slat. VARIABLE CAMBER LEADING EDGE FLAP To improve efficiency by giving a better leading edge profile, the camber of a leading edge flap may be increased as it is deployed. Unlike trailing edge flaps, which can be selected to intermediate positions, leading edge flaps are usually either fully extended (deployed) or retracted (stowed). Leading edge flaps increase the critical angle of attack. TRAILING EDGE FLAPS The increase in lift comes mainly from the variation in effective camber that occurs when the flaps are deflected. This alters the lift curve and also produces a higher maximum coefficient of lift. In some instances, the trailing edge flaps may also increase the wing's surface area. Extending the trailing edge flapsalters the pressure distribution around the wing. Trailing edge flaps decrease the critical angle of attack. LIFT TO DRAG RATIO The L/D ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore, the highest value of the L/D ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up.",

            "explanation": "The Venturi effect states that in a situation with constant mechanical energy, the velocity of a fluid passing through a constricted area (throat) will increase and its static pressure will decrease. The effect utilizes both the principle of continuity as well as the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. In the tube depicted in the attached figure, a fluid flows from left to right at a constant volume flow rate. To maintain this flow, the fluid must be moved at the same rate, despite the constricted space (throat) in the middle of the tube. Therefore, the velocity of the fluid is increased, as the fluid needs to flow faster in the constricted area. Continuity equation: Mass flow = A x p x V A- cross section area; p- air density; V- velocity With regards to this question, the airflow starts to accelerate when the diameter of the tube starts reducing (1) and the speed is the highest at the centre of the venturi (2). As we can see, at “4” the diameter has not expanded to its full width, therefore it is faster than at “1”. The speed at “2” is lower than at “3” because the reduction in diameter is not yet complete. Sequence of increasing magnitude of airflow speed: 1, 4, 2, 3",
