It is the change to the stability of an airplane with the passage of time. Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

To add to that, the low wing increases in AR (Aspect Ratio), while the high wing decreases in AR. Both of these will increase the lift on the low wing, and restore the aircraft to level flight, hence the high static lateral stability of swept wing aircraft. We also know that if you increase the lift, you increase the drag. So, it will have a slight tendency to yaw into the relative airflow (as there is more drag on the low wing), thereby contributing to static directional stability.

Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope.

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability affects many aspects of its flight characteristics. For an aircraft to be considered statically stable, it must initially begin to return to its original position/orientation after some sort of displacement. Think of placing a ball in a bowl, it will always begin to roll back to the bottom of the bowl, the equilibrium point. An aircraft can have stability in all three axes, pitch (longitudinal stability), yaw (directional stability) and roll (lateral stability). The opposite of stability is manoeuvrability, and if the aircraft is very stable, it is not very manoeuvrable, and vice-versa. The less stable (more manoeuvrable) we make an aircraft, the more easily it will change orientation. This is why aerobatic aircraft have very light controls, meaning that even small stick forces will cause a large aircraft movement, whereas stable aircraft, such as transport jets, are very stable, and will require much larger stick movements, and more stick force, to provide the same amount of aircraft movement. This is called stick force stability, which is a measure of how much input force is required to cause a 1G change. This question is asking about stick displacement, but it is largely the same thing. It is the reason that you would not want to cruise a highly aerobatic aircraft for long distances, as the fineness of control is difficult to achieve when the controls are so light and tiny movements cause huge changes. To answer the question, if small movements of the stick create large pitch/roll changes, the aircraft must be highly manoeuvrable. Interestingly, modern fighter aircraft, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, are designed to be statically unstable for highest manoeuvrability, and have very responsive fly-by-wire controls making sure that the aircraft does not become unstable during flight. Excellent for air-to-air combat, terrible if they lose their FBW system.",

Another way to think of this is that on approach, the runway will be out of the right hand side window, even if there is no crosswind. Wing sweep will help increase lateral stability. When a swept-wing airplane is sideslipping, the wing toward the sideslip will experience a higher velocity normal to the wing's leading edge than the wing away from the sideslip. More lift is generated on the wing toward the sideslip and a roll moment arises that tends to diminish the bank angle or sideslip and return the airplane to equilibrium. In this case, the airflow over the right wing becomes straighter (less swept). Straighter wings are effectively longer, so produce more lift, resulting in a larger rolling moment to the left returning the aircraft to a non-sideslipped condition. This is an example of positive lateral stability.",

One is a short-period oscillation and the other is a long-period oscillation called a phugoid. The phugoid is usually poorly damped; it has large variations of speed and height and has an almost uniform load factor (n). It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is normally heavily damped.

Learning Objective 081.04.04.05.01: Describe how the following aeroplane components contribute to static directional stability: wing; fin; dorsal fin; ventral fin; angle of sweep of the wing; angle of sweep of the fin; fuselage at high alpha; strakes. The vertical stabiliser (tail fin) of an aircraft is the main contributor to static directional stability (stability in yaw), as any sideslip angle will create a lift on the fin by introducing an angle of attack to its symmetrical aerofoil, which then will create a force on the aircraft to point into the relative airflow. From here on out, we are using the words, \"positive effect\" (on stability) to mean that it makes the aircraft more stable. The larger we make the tail fin, the larger the positive effect (on stability). Also, the further back we make the tail fin from the centre of gravity, the larger the moment arm of the force, so the larger the positive effect. For this question, we must remember that the fin is just a wing, but when we fly coordinated (no sideslip), it is a symmetrical aerofoil, so creating no lift in either direction. Introducing a sideslip (an angle of attack - AoA) causes a lift force to be made. The greater this force, the greater the \"positive effect\" on stability, which pushes the tail around so the nose points towards the relative airflow. Sweepback of a wing does a few things, it increases the MCRIT of the aerofoil by making it \"effectively thinner\", which is very useful for high speed flight. It also changes the low speed flying characteristics a lot, decreasing the coefficient of lift for each angle of attack, but increasing the critical (stalling) angle of attack (but with a lower maximum lift output). This last bit is particularly useful for aircraft. Swept back tail fins will remain useful at higher angles of sideslip before stalling, in comparison to straight fins. Increased sweepback of the tail fin usually has a negative effect on directional stability (stability in yaw). At low/medium sideslip angles, the reduced lift coefficient for each angle of attack produces less of a restoring force (the lower gradient on the graph above). It is important to note that at higher angles of attack, within a certain range, a straight fin will have stalled (so provides almost no stability) and the swept fin would not yet have stalled due to its higher stalling AoA, and in that case, the swept fin provides far more stabilising effect than a straight fin, but only within a certain range of large sideslip angles.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. If an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection, as the forces on the tailplane often are deflected downwards.",

The airplane with positive maneuvering stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. A CG position aft of this point would produce an unacceptably low value of maneuver stability and would make the airplane difficult to fly. For transport airplanes the aft limit is normally located at approximately 30% of the MAC.",

Dorsal fins are effectively just an extension to the main fin, extending forwards to provide some benefits such as the blending with the fuselage, reducing drag, providing better stability at high sideslip angles, etc. They therefore have a positive effect on directional and lateral stability. Ventral fins (sometimes called strakes), however, are placed under the fuselage, and provide a further increase in directional stability (yaw), but have the opposite effect to the main and dorsal fins when it comes to lateral stability, they are de-stabilising. Ventral fins are very useful for improving the stall/spin characteristcs of aircraft where the fuselage and wings may render the main fin less effective at high angles of attack (similar to a deep stall, but for stability). Their main limitation is ground clearance. None of these items have any effect on longitudinal stability, which is stability in pitch, as a pitch change will not cause any angle of attack change to these components. Some ventral fins/strakes are actually angled outwards, so they are not perfectly vertical. Now this would give very slightly increased longitudinal stability due to their location at the rear of the aircraft, however, the majority of ventral fins (as is the primary intention of them) have no effect on longitudinal stability.",

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability, and in particular its longitudinal stability (stability in pitch) is massively dependent on the location of the aircraft's Centre of Gravity (CG). As long as the CG is in front of the \"neutral point\", the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. The \"neutral point\" is a sort of average Centre of Pressure (CP) for the whole aircraft, and it goes towards where there are more aerodynamic surfaces. Think of a throwing dart, the front had a weight and the back has a set of fins, therefore a very far forward CG and a far back \"neutral point\". This is a very stable system. A far forward CG therefore is a more stable condition. This also means a less manoeuvrable condition. Less manoeuvrability means that the pilot will have to push and pull harder on the controls to achieve the same result, as the control surfaces need to move further to achieve the same angular change. The controls feel \"heavier\" with a further forward CG, but the aircraft is more stable. This can be counteracted by the Fly-By-Wire system, which uses the knowledge of the aircraft's weight and CG position to estimate the required control surface deflection, and make the controls feel the same as for any other CG position, so the pilot has the same control of the aircraft, no matter the weight or CG position. If the CG is further forwards, the FBW system will amplify the pilot's inputs more than normal in the pitch axis, to make the aircraft control as it would do \"normally\". This means that, in this scenario, the pilot has entered an artificially far forward CG, so the FBW system will amplify the pilot's actions in pitch, but without any need to do so, as the CG is not actually that far forward. This could lead to overcontrolling of the aircraft by the fly-by-wire system, as the aircraft is not as stable as the FMS/FBW believes. The overcontrolling could potentially reduce the stability of the aircraft, or even cause instability. As this question is easy to misread or misunderstand, we will quickly go through each option: \"Due to the design criteria applied, the longitudinal stability of the aircraft is always ensured, irrespective of the location of the CG.\" Whilst this looks plausible, the longitudinal stability is not ensured (and will be reduced or removed) when the CG goes out of the aft limit. \"The actual longitudinal stability is lower than calculated by the FBW system, and the system may allow for control surface deflections that result in instability.\" As mentioned above, this is correct, due to the incorrectly entered CG position, which may allow the FBW to overcontrol the aircraft. The aircraft is less stable than the FBW system believes. \"The aircraft consumes more fuel than expected during the cruise phase of the flight, as the FBW system deflects the horizontal stabiliser more to counteract the error of the pilot.\" The aircraft will actually consume less fuel than expected, but because the aircraft expects a forward CG in the cruise, which causes the tailplane to produce more downforce, and requires more lift from the wing, causing higher drag. However, the aircraft actually has a further aft CG, so will burn less fuel than expected. This is also not connected to the FBW system creating larger deflections, that is an effect which would occur in this case, but has negligible effect on fuel consumption. \"The pitch rates commanded by the FBW system are lower at higher altitudes compared to the pitch rates required to ensure that the longitudinal stability remains positive.\" This has nothing to do with the scenario mentioned in the question (incorrectly inputted CG location).",

            "explanation": "When a manufacturer shortens the fuselage of an aircraft from 9 seats to 6 seats, the aircraft's overall dimensions and weight change. In this case, the manufacturer has increased the size of the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer to account for the reduced fuselage length. The larger vertical fin provides greater surface area for controlling yaw, while the larger horizontal stabilizer increases pitch stability. The larger vertical fin increases the surface area available to resist the yawing moment caused by asymmetrical thrust, crosswinds, or other factors that could cause the aircraft to turn left or right. This results in improved directional stability of the aircraft, which means that it is less likely to deviate from its intended course. Therefore, option \"Positive, since the higher vertical fin.\" is the correct answer. The increased size of the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer should not reduce the effectiveness of the rudder, as the rudder is the primary control surface for yaw control. In fact, the larger surface area of the vertical fin may even enhance the rudder's effectiveness, as it provides more area for the rudder to deflect and generate a yawing moment.",

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is almost trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, then, if the aircraft's rate of turn, rate of descent and speed are all decreasing, then it is naturally rolling out of the turn, and is therefore stable in the spiral (dive) mode.",

Please send us any further feedback in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The yaw damper's main purpose is to prevent Dutch roll. Basically speaking, Dutch roll is a series of out-of-phase turns, when the aircraft rolls in one direction and yaws in the other due to a high amount of lateral stability but not quite enough directional stability. When the yaw is introduced, the strong “dihedral effect” will roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. Since the possibility of a Dutch roll increases with increasing altitude due to the lower aerodynamic damping at high altitude, aircraft can sometimes be restricted to fly at lower altitudes only when the yaw damper is unserviceable.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is usually heavily damped.

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

The change in lift (side force) on the fin creates a yawing moment about the centre of gravity which tends to yaw the aeroplane into the relative airflow. The magnitude of the fin contribution to static directional stability depends on both the change in fin lift and the fin moment arm. The lift curve slope of the fin determines how sensitive the surface is to change in angle of attack. While it is desirable to have a high lift curve slope for the fin, a high aspect ratio surface is not necessarily practical or desirable due to: - Bending - Lower stalling angle - Hangar roof clearance The stall angle of the surface must be large enough to prevent stall and subsequent loss of effectiveness at expected sideslip angles. Sweepback or low aspect ratio increases the stalling angle of attack of the fin and reduces the lift curve slope, therefore reducing static directional stability.",

In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point may be imagined as the effective aerodynamic center of the entire airplane configuration, i.e. with the CG at the neutral point, all changes in net lift effectively occur at that point and no change in pitching moment results. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. As seen in figure 1, neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment. The further aft the neutral point is from the CG the greater is the static longitudinal stability.",

The position of the CG directly affects the magnitude of the longitudinal static stability, the tailplane downforce and the stalling speed because its position determines the length of the arm of any restoring moment. A forward movement of the CG increases the positive longitudinal static stability of an aircraft but decreases the manoeuvrability and control response because the moment arm is increased in length and increases the nose-down pitching moment. Thus, the elevators have less nose-up authority. MANOEUVRING STABILITY The most direct appreciation of the manoeuvring stability of an aeroplane is obtained from a plot of stick force versus load factor. The aeroplane with positive manoeuvring stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. When the aeroplane has high static stability, the manoeuvring stability will be high and a high stick force gradient will result. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing manoeuvring stability.",

If this movement is the result of an undesirable disturbance, then the ability of the airplane to return to its original heading without the assistance of any control-surface movement is a measure of its directional static stability. It is a measure of the aircraft’s ability to realign itself with the relative airflow. An airplane has directional static stability if, when in a sideslip with the airflow coming from the right initially the nose tends to yaw right. The drag of a swept wing is less than that of an unswept wing. The advantage of this type of wing at high speeds is gained at the expense of its poor performance at low speed. The drag experienced with a swept wing is the component of the relative airflow at 90◦ to the line joining the aerodynamic center of the wing, which if the wing has parallel leading and trailing edges will be the normal to the leading edge of the wing. In figure 1 the normal component of the relative airflow is greater on the port wing than the normal component on the starboard wing. The drag on the leading wing, the port wing, in figure 1 is of greater magnitude than that of the trailing starboard wing because of its decreased effective sweep angle. It is therefore a stabilizing influence. Positive sweepback has a stabilizing effect on directional stability because the CP is further aft, and the stalling angle is increased. The significance and magnitude of this effect on directional static stability is directly proportional to the angle of sweepback.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback for this question has been limited so far, so we are requesting any further feedback to verify the options and the question wording. Thank you! LONGITUDINAL STABILITY (figure 1) Longitudinal stability is motion about the lateral axis. An aircraft will exhibit static longitudinal stability if it tends to return towards the trim angle of attack when displaced by a gust OR a control input. If the tail moment is greater than the wing moment, the sum of the moments will not be zero and the resultant nose-down moment will give an angular acceleration about the CG. The nose-down angular acceleration about the CG will return the aircraft towards its original position of equilibrium. The greater the tail moment relative to the wing moment, the greater the rate of acceleration towards the original equilibrium position. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. STICK FORCE STABILITY (STICK FORCE PER G) (figure 2) The force on the stick required to change the aircraft's load factor by 1 G. One of the biggest factors for changing stick force stability is the change of stability from a movement of the CG. Moving the CG forwards increases the stability of the aircraft, thereby reducing manoeuvrability, and increasing stick force stability, as seen by the steeper line on figure 2 when the CG is at 10% MAC (far forward CG = higher stick force per G). The change in mass on its own causes an unknown change to the stick force per G without in-depth analysis into the particular aircraft (so we assume no change), and the only change in stick force stability comes from the CG movement.",

When a wind gust makes an airplane with spiral instability to side-slip, powerful directional stability tends to yaw the airplane back into alignment with the relative wind. In this case the outside wing will generate more lift as it travels faster. This tends to roll the airplane in the direction of the yaw. The rolling force overcomes the weak dihedral effect, allowing further roll. As the vertical component of lift decreases, the relative wind has an upward component with the airplane swinging in alignment with the air stream, the nose begins to drop. This results in a gradually increasing spiral dive. Note: Dutch Roll = may occur when static lateral stability is too high compared to the static directional stability.",

When a wing drops, due to a disturbance, the tendency of the aeroplane to correct this departure from the balanced condition in level flight is dependent on the lateral stability of the aeroplane. Additionally, when a wing drops, it causes other secondary motions to be initiated. The fin and rudder tend to yaw the aeroplane into the airflow in the direction of the dropped wing. Because of the yaw, the higher wing on the outside of the turn is travelling faster than the lower wing and develops a greater amount of lift. This generates a rolling moment in the opposite direction to the correcting moment of the dihedral and if the rolling moment is greater it will tend to increase the angle of bank. If the rolling moment is of sufficient magnitude to overcome the correcting force, produced by the dihedral and the damping yaw effect, the bank angle will increase and the aeroplane will enter a steadily steepening spiral dive. This is spiral instability that can be described as a combined lateral and directional aperiodic motion.",

The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service. While dorsal and ventral fins contribute positively to directional static stability, a dorsal fin contributes positively to lateral static stability, while a ventral fin is destabilizing in this mode and has no effect on longitudinal stability.

When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable.

Thus, the tail has a stabilising contribution for stability which is represented by a negative slopped curve Z. Position of the Centre of Gravity Variations in the position of the centre of gravity greatly affect the static longitudinal stability of an aircraft. Generally, the further forward the centre of gravity the greater the stability. Note: Tail effect: The downward force moment at the tail causes the aircraft to pitch up. When the center of gravity (Cg) is positioned forward, it creates a pitch-down moment at the nose of the aircraft.",

The control forces of the aeroplane should reflect the stability of the aeroplane and provide suitable reference to the pilot for precise control of the aeroplane. When the CG position of the aeroplane is fixed, each elevator position corresponds to a particular trim lift coefficient. As the CG is moved aft, the slope of this line decreases, and the decrease in stability is evident by a given control displacement causing a greater change in trim lift coefficient. This is evidence that decreasing stability causes increased controllability and, of course, increasing stability decreases controllability. For the same value of CL, a more stable aircraft (forward CG) will require a higher elevator deflection. If the CG is moved aft until the line of trim CL versus elevator deflection has zero slope, neutral static stability is obtained.",

Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

            "explanation": "This question is unnecessarily long and wordy, but does give some hints which help to remove incorrect options quickly. Static stability pertains to how a system reacts immediately when disturbed. In a statically stable system, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Manoeuvrability, on the other hand, is the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various manoeuvres. Stability and manoeuvrability are effectively opposite, and the greater an aircraft's stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, and vice-versa. An aircraft with a further forward CG has greater stability (but lower manoeuvrability) and aircraft with aft CG locations have lower stability, but higher manoeuvrability. Higher weight also tends to reduce manoeuvrability, but this rule isn't always as simple as the CG locations. The question tells us that stability is affected by the CG location and the gross weight of the aircraft, and, knowing that manoeuvrability and stability are closely (and inversely) linked, that hints to us that those factors also affect the manoeuvrability, which they do. That removes the following options: \"cannot be affected by the pilot or operator as it is determined by the aircraft design.\", as the CG location and weight can be affected by the operator/pilot, so therefore, the manoeuvrability can be too; and \"is determined by the size of the control surfaces only, not the CG position or the weight.\", as the manoeuvrability is changed by the CG location and weight. The other options can be chosen between based on the CG location and weight, and the effects of those mentioned above.",

It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is normally heavily damped.

Adequate controllability must be available to perform take-off and landing and accomplish the various maneuvers in flight. A contradiction exists between stability and controllability. A high degree of stability gives reduced controllability. The relationship between static stability and controllability is demonstrated by figure 1 and 2. The effect of increased static stability (forward CG movement) on controllability is illustrated by the ball in a steeper trough (figure 2). A greater force is required to “control” the ball to the same position of displacement when the static stability is increased. In this manner, a large degree of static stability tends to make the aircraft less controllable. It is necessary to achieve the proper proportion between static stability and controllability during the design of an aircraft because too much static stability (forward CG position) reduces controllability. The forward CG limit is set to ensure minimum controllability.",

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

Spiral dives can make the aircraft speed up very quickly and can cause overspeed or overstress if not dealt with quickly, as they get worse with time. Spiral dives are referred to as \"aperiodic\" motion as they do not go back and forth (like dutch roll), they only happen once, getting further from equilibrium. The key part of this question is that spiral dives are always pointing downwards, as they are a dive. If the nose was upwards, they would be a stall/spin. Note that you can easily create an accelerated stall leading to a spin from a spiral dive, if handled incorrectly.",

This force may be reduced to zero by operation of the trim controls. The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. A Trimmable Horizontal Stabiliser (THS) enables a larger CG and speed range than a conventional tailplane with stabiliser, elevator and trim tab, because the whole stabiliser may be moved for trimming the aeroplane, instead of a relatively “small” elevator and trim tab only (a larger surface is much more effective). This also leads to more control difficulty due to a jammed stabiliser. An aircraft on final apporach is configured and trimmed for low speed, i.e. nose up trim. This means that, in case of go-around, the pilot should be prepared to apply nose down or trim nose down to prevent excessive pitch up caused by the additional power.",

Tail strike – the rotation is started before it is possible to lift-off, consequently angle of attack might be increased up to tail strike. In this case, a 12% CG position will tend to hold the nose down (nose-heavy). To counter this, the pilots need to set a nose up trim in order to create a nose-up pitching moment at rotation. The actual CG position is however more aft which will naturally help lifting the aircraft nose. This natural tendency, combined with a nose-up trim, will result in a tendency of the nose lifting of earlier than intended and faster, increasing the risk of a tail strike.",

To maintain the primary control surface in its required position, the tab is moved in the opposite direction to the control surface until the tab moment balances the control surface hinge moment. Stabiliser Trim (figure 2) This system of trimming may be used on manually operated and power operated controls. To trim, the tailplane incidence is adjusted by the trim wheel until the tailplane load is equal to the previous elevator balancing load required. Stick force is now zero. The main advantages of a variable incidence (trimming) tailplane are: - The drag is less in the trimmed state as the aerofoil is more streamlined. - Trimming does not reduce the effective range of pitch control as the elevator remains approximately neutral when the aircraft is trimmed. - It is very powerful and gives an increased ability to trim for larger CG and speed range. The disadvantage of a variable incidence (trimming) tailplane is that it is more complex and is heavier than a conventional trim tab system. In this exercise, Figures 1 and 3 refer to trim tabs, and Figures 2 and 4 refer to stabiliser Trim. The least amount of drag would be produced by a stabiliser trim where the position of the elevator is neutral, which, in this case, is Figure 4.",

The position of the CG not only affects the positive longitudinal static stability, it also affects the pitch handling characteristics. When the elevators are deflected, the pitching moment they produce must be greater than the restoring moment of the airplane’s positive longitudinal static stability. An aircraft has higher longitudinal stability with a forward CG (meaning the force and deflection required to make a pitch change is higher), so therefore an aft movement of CG decreases the stability (increases the manoeuvrability), providing the same change in load factor for a smaller control surface deflection.",

The control surface to cause the nose up movement is the elevator. The elevator is positioned behind the Center of Gravity, while the nose is positioned in front of it. Therefore, if the nose rises, the opposite action should happen at the tail. This is done by the elevator generating negative lift (also called downforce). The elevator does this by moving upwards, changing the aerodynamic camber of the tailplane to a negative camber. Whereas positive camber generates positive lift, negative camber generates negative lift. This effect pushes the tail (which is positioned behind the CG) downwards, which has an opposite reaction on the nose (in front of the CG), which comes up.",

            "explanation": "Because the hinge moment on some airplanes is too small, often as the result of the CP being too close to the hinge-line of the control surface, it is too easy to deflect the control surface against the aerodynamic load. Consequently, there is little control column load and there is a lack of feel to the controls. This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe. To counteract these characteristics and assist the pilot to use the control surfaces correctly it is necessary to have anti-balance tabs fitted. These operate in the opposite sense to the balance tab by deflecting the anti-balance tab in the same direction as that of the primary control surface and increase the aerodynamic loading.",

This question is incredibly vague, and as yet we really don't know what the examiner wants from us, and the answer is not confirmed (we are not very sure of it either). In particular, we don't know how degraded the FBW system is, and what the options are regarding the control differences. FLY-BY-WIRE In a fly-by-wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, which will hydraulically deflect a flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW also enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which, provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. FBW has multiple different modes of \"control laws\" which can be used. Normal Law - All control augmentations and protections are in place. Alternate Law - Some protections are lost, some features act differently to normal, and the autopilot may be lost (depending on the fault). Direct Law - In direct law, the pilot's controls are NOT augmented at all by the internal computers (for flight envelope protection, etc.), and the exact control movement is sent exactly as it is to the hydraulic servo valves. Autopilot is always lost. Stall and over speed warnings are still available. Mechanical back-up - Not really a control law at all, if FBW has failed, then all that is left is some form of mechanical back-up, for instance on the A320, it is some rudder control and manual trimming. Therefore, a large degradation of the aircraft, down to direct law or mechanical back-up will cause large changes in control for the pilots. It will often be quite a different aircraft to fly in this case. As for why the two aircraft might have different reactions to a degradation in FBW, we don't really know. We need more information to be able to dig into that.",

So much so that EASA commissioned a report to be made, testing de-icing fluid and its effects on a horizontal stabiliser section. The build-up of thickening fluids on the front of the elevator can make it very resistive to movements during take-off, especially with manual flight controls. Although it is not in the current learning objectives, it seems that an examiner wants you to know about it. Thankfully, it is the only possible correct option. \"The control cables connecting the control column to the elevator have torn.\" This would not be a case that is specific to icing conditions, and the cables tearing could cause a few different feelings on the control column, but most likely very light resistance to movement, not heavy. The aircraft also would not respond at all. \"The ailerons have frozen in position.\" The ailerons provide roll control, so whilst this is a bad situation, a pilot would not notice that the nose was heavy, as the pitch is controlled by the elevators. \"The increased air density means insufficient thrust is being produced to reach VR.\" Quite the other way, high air density due to the cold air would cause higher thrust from the engine, and better performance.",

However, they are not suitable for jet airplanes because of their large range of operating speeds, preference, for this type of airplane, is given to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer. There are two types of trim tab in common use: the variable and the fixed. The variable trim tabs may be manually or electrically controlled. If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up. This does not affect the static longitudinal stability. Anti-balance tab Because the hinge moment on some airplanes is too small, often as the result of the CP being too close to the hinge-line of the control surface, it is too easy to deflect the control surface against the aerodynamic load. Consequently, there is little control column load and there is a lack of feel to the controls. This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe. To counteract these characteristics and assist the pilot to use the control surfaces correctly it is necessary to have anti-balance tabs fitted. These operate in the opposite sense to the balance tab by deflecting the anti-balance tab in the same direction as that of the primary control surface and increase the aerodynamic loading.",

            "explanation": "In flight, an aircraft can rotate about any one, or any combination of, its three axes. These axes are at right angles to each other and all pass through the aircraft’s centre of gravity. The moment around an axis is produced by changing the aerodynamic force on the appropriate aerofoil. The magnitude of the force is a product of the dynamic pressure (IAS) and the angular displacement of the control surface. Aerodynamic force can be changed by: - adjusting the camber of the aerofoil. - changing the incidence of the aerofoil. - decreasing lift and increasing drag by “spoiling” the airflow. Changing the camber of any aerofoil (wing, tailplane or fin) will change its lift. Deflecting a control surface effectively changes its camber. AILERONS The primary effect of ailerons is to provide roll control about the longitudinal axis A downward movement of the aileron causes an increase in the effective angle of attack and a corresponding increase in lift, whilst an upward movement of the aileron causes a reduction in the effective angle of attack and a decrease in lift. The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment.",

Creating an unstable situation. Therefore, the effect is destabilizing. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-by-wire - The flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted control systems, which have natural feedback to the flight controls. Fly-by-wire systems do not have to be joystick controlled. Aircraft such as the B777 are controlled by yoke, but are fly-by-wire, whereas the modern Airbus aircraft use joysticks.",

They will also increase drag on the wing when raised. When turning, the downward-going wing will experience a decrease in lift with an upward-going aileron. This decrease in lift can be assisted by raising the spoiler as well. Raising the spoiler on the downward-going wing also increases drag on that wing, which helps to counter adverse yaw. The degree of spoiler that needs to be raised varies proportionally to the aileron input, allowing for versatility in adding drag and decreasing lift. At the same time, the spoiler on the upward-going wing will remain flush.",

As shown schematically in the diagram, a device sensitive to dynamic pressure (1⁄2 ρ V2). Pitot pressure is fed to one side of a chamber and static pressure to the other, which moves a diaphragm under the influence of changing dynamic pressure with airspeed. This causes “regulated” hydraulic pressure to provide a resistance or ‘feel’ on the pilot’s input controls proportional to IAS2, just as in a manual control. In addition, stick force should increase as stick displacement increases. An advantage of artificial feel is that it can be configured to provide envelope protection, which prevents the pilot over stressing the aircraft. The Boeing777 fly- by-wire system employs envelope protection. This feature of the artificial-feel system provides increasingly greater force when the aircraft is pushed to its limits.",

            "explanation": "CG position VS Aircraft’s performance A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. FORWARD CG increases the pitch down moment tendency of the aircraft. Therefore, greater horizontal stabilizer and elevator deflections are needed to give the aircraft a pitch-up attitude to compensate for the pitch-down moment. Extra lift is generated by increasing the angle of attack, which in turn increases induced drag. Thus performance decreases. For take-off, if the CG position is too far forward, the aircraft is said to have a “heavy nose”. Conversely, as the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since Climb gradient is a product of excess of thrust over drag, climb performance will be improved. For take-off, if the CG position is too far aft, the aircraft is said to have a “light nose” making the rotation easier. Additionally, an aircraft which requires less lift will have a slower rotation speed, which results in a reduced take-off distance. To simplify this concept and make it easier to answer these type of question you can think of a forward CG as having the same effects as a heavy aircraft; and an aft CG as having the same result as a light aircraft.",

The pilot can control the stabiliser by using the trim wheel. If the linkage is mechanic or power-assisted, the neutral point of the control column changes with trim setting.

On the wing with the down-going aileron, they remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers cannot give an increase of lift, so a roll manoeuvre controlled by spoilers will give a net loss of lift. However, the spoiler has several advantages compared to the aileron: - There is no adverse yaw. - Wing twisting is reduced. - At transonic speed, its effectiveness is not reduced by shock wave induced flow separation. - They cannot develop flutter. - Spoilers do not occupy the trailing edge, which can be utilised for more flaps. An example is illustrated in the attached figure. Speed brakes have been selected, and then a turn to the left is initiated. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the up-going aileron will stay deployed, or modulate upwards, depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron will modulate towards the stowed position. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron may partially or fully stow, again depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. Note: Roll control spoilers are generally distributed throughout the wing, and the system depends on pilot input to modulate the degree of deflection and which spoilers to extend or retract. On this question, it seems that EASA considers the most likely to extend to be the outboard spoilers.

Creating an unstable situation. Therefore, the effect is destabilizing. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. When the aircraft's CG (Centre of Gravity) is located far forwards within the aircraft, the aircraft's stability is high, and its manoeuvrability is low. When the CG is located further aft, the aircraft is less stable, but more manoeuvrable. Pitch manoeuvrability is measured by the \"stick force per G\" (stick force stability), meaning how much force the pilot needs to apply to the controls to gain an extra 1G of vertical acceleration. The higher the stick force stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, so in this question, as the CG has been moved aft by the cargo, the manoeuvrability will be increased, so the stick force stability will decrease. The second part of this question is about the aircraft's trim in relation to the CG location. Most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. The trim is often done (and in this question certainly done) by an all moving tailplane, known as a variable-incidence horizontal stabiliser, so the whole stabiliser moves to perform the act of trimming. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra cargo behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards. This will be the same during the cruise, where less nose down moment will be required, so the leading edge of the stabiliser will be pointing more upwards than if the cargo was not loaded.",

Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance. To counter adverse yaw, some aircraft incorporate aileron/rudder coupling which is a system that automatically applies a rudder input in a turn to counter the adverse yawing moments generated by the ailerons. In a right turn, the left wing lift is increased by lowering the aileron. As we have described above, increased lift, increases induced drag, which generates a yawing moment in the opposite direction. As a result, the aircraft will be in an unbalanced turn. To re-balance the turn, right rudder must be applied.",

If you encounter this question during your official exam, kindly inform us. We appreciate your assistance. 081.05.07.01.01: Explain which parameters may be controlled in level flight with the pitch control law. Fly-by-wire is a sophisticated system that substitutes the traditional manual-mechanical flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. Within this system, a computer interface is interposed between the pilots and the final control surfaces. Modern commercial fly-by-wire aircraft integrate a flight-envelope protection system into their flight control software, which is housed within the flight control computer. This protection system serves the crucial role of preventing pilots from issuing control commands that could push the aircraft beyond its structural and aerodynamic operational boundaries. In the realm of fly-by-wire technology, the concept of flight envelope and maneuvering envelope protections is employed. These are governed by predefined control laws that serve as a set of rules, guiding the computers in transforming input signals. One of the most commonly used control laws involves managing the load factor in pitch control. Essentially, this means that the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) adjusts its position to maintain a specific load factor. When the pilot manipulates the sidestick, the THS moves accordingly, altering the load factor proportionally to the sidestick's deflection (refer to the attached diagram). This means that as long as the sidestick remains untouched, the aircraft will maintain its flight-path-angle-corrected load factor. For example, if the aircraft is in straight and level flight and the pilot pulls the sidestick, the aircraft will follow a curved trajectory, increasing its pitch angle until the sidestick is released.",

It may therefore be written quite differently in the exam, and we cannot ensure that it is even precisely the same question, so do read it careful and evaluate that yourself, and please place any further feedback in the comments, thank you! Adverse yaw is a yawing motion with an opposite direction to the turning/rolling motion of the aircraft. Adverse yaw is caused by the drag on the down-going aileron being greater than that on the up-going aileron. This is because the down-going aileron is effectively acting like a trailing edge flap with high camber, so higher drag, but the up-going aileron is reducing the camber of the wing, so has a lower drag. This imbalance in drag causes the yawing motion around the normal/vertical axis. Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance and may cause uncoordinated turns. Adverse (aileron) yaw is corrected in the design by the use of either differential ailerons, Frise ailerons or aileron/rudder coupling. The differential aileron system counteracts adverse yaw by making the draggy down-going aileron go proporitonally less far, so a smaller angular change, than the low drag up-going aileron. This means that the up-going aileron does more of the work, and therefore produces a similar amount of drag to the other aileron, and the aircraft roll rate is the same. This could mean, for instance, that the up-going aileron moves 30% further upwards than the down-going aileron goes downwards. For this question, BE VERY CAREFUL. The higher drag down-going aileron is on the UP-GOING WING. This means that; The up-going wing produces a greater amount of drag when normal ailerons are fitted. The differential ailerons will therefore make the aileron on that wing move less far to counteract the adverse yaw effect.",

If you see this question in the exam, please send anything you can remember to us in the comments, through the question feedback tab on your dashboard or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. In any conventional aircraft, the application of rudder will cause some secondary effect of roll, usually towards the direction that the rudder was applied. This effect is very strong in swept wing aircraft, and very noticeable when flying them, hence the reason most jets of this kind are flown without the use of the rudder pedals except for engine failures and crosswind take-offs and landings. Using full rudder deflection only to intercept the final approach course is a terrible idea as the aircraft will violently roll to the right. This is because the left wing will be significantly accelerated through a much longer arc that the right wing, which conversely gets a much reduced speed of airflow during that motion, causing a large right wing drop, and the right wing could even stall if the effect were large enough to increase the right wing's angle of attack above the critical AoA. As for the other answers: The left wing would not stall as there is greater airspeed over it and with no significant increase of angle of attack. Adverse yaw is a secondary effect which occurs when ailerons are used for roll purposes, so does not really apply to this situation. There is indeed a potential for loss of control to occur in this scenario, but we think this answer is way too vague (and the feedback was also not 100% about the wording here so we can't confirm it yet) so for now we are saying this is less correct than the potential for the right wing stalling.",

The horizontal straight line joining the most forward point of the fuselage of the airplane, the center of the nose, to the center of the most rearward point of the airplane’s fuselage is the longitudinal axis. It is often referred to as the roll axis because the airplane, in response to a control input by the pilot or as the result of an external disturbance, drops one wing and raises the other. Thus, it rotates or rolls about the longitudinal axis. The flight controls enable the pilot to rotate the airplane about its three axes. The ailerons and the rudder cause the airplane to roll about its longitudinal axis, the elevators enable the airplane to pitch around its lateral axis and the rudder allows the airplane to yaw around its normal axis.",

When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Aeroplane 2: the thrust line is below the CG (the case of most airliners with underwing engines), therefore a thrust increase will produce an added pitch-up moment. This will cause the airplane to slow down more than necessary (despite the added thrust). Creating an unstable situation. To counteract this, a pitch-down moment must be created. Therefore, the elevator must be deflected downwards. Regardless of the type of aircraft, adjusting the configuration will always result in a trim change.

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra fuel behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards.",

Therefore, we will explain to you the basics here, then you can let us know if you see it in the exam, and what the correct answer was (or if the question/options were different at all), thank you! This comes back to stability, and longitudinal stability in particular (stability in pitch). Think of a stable aircraft like a throwing dart, weight at the front, fins at the back, and it is incredibly stable flying through the air, always landing facing into the dartboard. This is the same for an aircraft, and we have to make our \"weight\" (Centre of Gravity, CG) in front of our \"wings\", which are dictated by the Centre of Pressure (CP)/Centre of lift (CL) of our wings and other aerodynamic features. The \"neutral point\" is the average location of the pressure effects from all our wings, fuselage, engine cowlings and other aerodynamic features, sort of the balanced centre of pressure of the whole aircraft. As long as our CG is in front of our neutral point, then the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. Also, the weight, acting through the CG, is not in line with all the lift, acting through the CP. This means that the further forward weight will cause a nose-down moment. We obviously have to counteract this moment, and this is why the tailplane is tasked with providing a downwards force on the aircraft tail, causing a balancing nose-up moment. Of course, the movement of the CG and CP can change how much downforce the tail needs to produce. If the CG moves further forwards, the tailplane has to produce higher downforce to counteract the larger nose down moment, and vice-versa. The way that the tailplane produces downforce is two-fold. It usually has a low/negative angle of incidence, to provide a negative angle of attack, and the downwash from the wings causes an even larger negative angle of attack, particularly at high aircraft AoA (low speed), when the wing downwash angle is greater. This is why tailplanes have elevators, to change their angle of attack for control, and for trimming at different speeds. This does not unfortunately help us get a solid answer for this question. Of course, the increased speed means a higher airflow over the tailplane, but also leads to decreased downwash angle from the main wing (due to lower angle of attack), but now with a more negative angle of attack without accounting for downwash due to the lower pitch angle of the aeroplane. These are opposing effects, and without knowing the aircraft and speed range, it is really very difficult to say whether the force increases or decreases. Our tendency is to say that the downwash angle and pitch angle mostly cancel each other out, and that the increased airflow increases the down-force of the tailplane. We can also justify this by saying that when an aircraft gets faster, we have to trim down, which is us artificially decreasing the downforce of our tailplane via the elevator, this means the downforce must have been too large after the speed increase, therefore the force increased. We do not like having to use this as an justification, as there are other forces at play, but it works quite well for everyone to understand.",

            "explanation": "There are two scenarios that this could be; a faulty autopilot or trim runaway. A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is impossible to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. Therefore, first, the pilot must disconnect the autopilot to stop any autopilot fault from making the situation worse. They should then attempt to control the aircraft manually, and if the trim runaway continues, switch off the electric trim and trim manually. On balance, we would say that both of the actions in the question are correct, and with pretty much correct reasoning, although there will be an order in which to do these actions, set out by the manufacturer. We haven't had this answer confirmed though, so please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and anything you can remember about it, thank you!",

If the CG is too far aft, the aircraft may be excessively tail-heavy, leading to difficulty in controlling the pitch attitude. When an aircraft has an aft center of gravity (CG), it will tend to rotate rapidly during takeoff and naturally adopt a high nose attitude during climb-out. Conversely, if the CG is forward (nose-heavy), the opposite effect will occur. To counterbalance these tendencies and ensure a smooth takeoff, the position of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) is adjusted. This adjustment aims to achieve two goals: first, to maintain a standard rotation rate, and second, to facilitate the aircraft settling into the desired climb-out attitude with minimal trim adjustments.",

In this setup, the flying control is connected to a small servo tab mounted on the trailing edge of the main control surface, rather than directly to the control surface itself. Moving the servo tab generates a force that moves the main control surface. In summary, the control surface is only moved by aerodynamic forces while the servo tab is moved directly by the pilot. Regarding this question: Imagine the aircraft is parked with no wind and the flight controls are not locked. The control surface would tilt down due to gravity. If the pilot moves the controls, only the servo tab moves; the control surface stays tilted down. When taxiing with a headwind, the control surface can level out due to aerodynamic forces. The pilot can then adjust the angle using the servo tab, though less effectively than in flight. If taxiing with a tailwind stronger than the aircraft's speed, the relative wind from behind can push the control surface up or down, depending on its previous position. Thus, the statement that \"the position is undetermined during taxiing, in particular with tailwind\" is correct.",

The trimmable stabilizer's primary advantage is that it provides tremendous trimming power over the full speed range of the airplane since the entire stabiliser may be moved to trim the aircraft. Summary: A trimmable horizontal stabiliser is more suitable to cope with the large trim changes generated by the high lift devices on most jet transport aeroplanes. \"II. A trim tab runaway causes less control difficulty.\" CORRECT Runaway trim occurs when the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) or other trim devices on the aircraft tail fails to stop at the desired position and continues to deflect up or down. A trim tab is much smaller than a trimmable horizontal stabiliser. Therefore, if it runs to the wrong position, it will produce smaller forces than a THS, thus causing less control difficuty.",

            "explanation": "Ailerons are the control surface on an aircraft that controls roll. They are usually mounted at the tips of the wings, to create the largest moment arm between them and the centre of gravity, for greater effectiveness. This can become problematic, particularly at high speeds. At high speeds, the forces on a control surface are so great that they can actually twist the wing they are connected to. The further outboard the ailerons are, the easier it is to cause the wing to twist, as it has less stiffness. Imagine a down-going aileron, used to increase the lift of the wing and make the wing rise. This would also twist the wing so its trailing edge was up, and therefore the leading edge goes down, causing the wing to lose lift, and the wing would drop, instead of rising. We call this aileron reversal, shown in the annex above. This is why many high speed aircraft often have secondary ailerons, which are called inboard ailerons, much closer to the fuselage, that are used during high speed flight, and the outboard ailerons are locked in place to avoid control reversal, flutter, and other structural issues due to the high aerodynamic forces. Some aircraft use roll spoilers also. There is also a low speed aileron reversal that happens near the stall, so be aware of the similar names.",

Yaw causes a slight increase in airspeed over the outer wing of the turn and a decrease in airspeed over the inner wing. As a result, the outer wing will generate more lift than the other, introducing a rolling motion. In this case, if an aircraft yaws left, the right wing will travel faster, generating more lift. This will cause a roll to the left.",

This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. The deflection of the ailerons on airplanes fitted with rudder coupling causes the rudder to move an amount proportional to the angular displacement of the aileron and to oppose adverse yaw.",

            "explanation": "An aeroplane is trimmed when it will maintain its attitude and speed without the pilot having to apply any load to the cockpit controls. If it is necessary for a control surface to be deflected to maintain balance of the aircraft, the pilot will need to apply a force to the cockpit control to hold the surface in its deflected position. This force may be reduced to zero by operation of the trim controls. The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. VARIABLE INCIDENCE TAILPLANE The Variable Incidence Horizontal Stabiliser provides pitch trim on most transport category aircraft. Varying the angle of incidence has the same effect as moving the elevator, but is aerodynamically more efficient, particularly at high airspeeds, and can provide a considerable trim range. An actuator near the leading edge varies the angle of incidence of the stabiliser. This normally operates in conjunction with the elevator to produce the least trim drag. The position of the CG directly affects the amount of trim necessary for the angle of attack required. A forward CG adds to the inherent longitudinal stability of the aeroplane; the pilot may run out of elevator up movement and be unable to maintain the required attitude. An aft CG decreases the longitudinal stability and makes the aeroplane more difficult or impossible to control in pitch. The CG must remain within the CG safe envelope at all times to ensure that the aeroplane remains controllable in all phases of flight. The elevator trim or stabiliser trim setting must be preset to a value for take-off and initial climb that will ensure a minimum stick force during this critical stage of flight. In comparison with a correctly balanced aeroplane during take-off, the position of the stabiliser for a nose-light aeroplane requires nose-down trim from an increased stabiliser angle of incidence.",

Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer would could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional computers and hydraulic systems.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. In this case, if an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection",

The aerodynamic force on the controls will depend on the area of the control surface, its angular displacement, and the IAS. For large and fast aircraft, the resulting aerodynamic force can give hinge moments / stick forces which are too high for easy operation of the controls. The pilot will require assistance to move the controls in these conditions, and this can be done either by using (hydraulic) powered flying controls or by using some form of aerodynamic balance.",

They also need large control surfaces to be able to control such large aircraft. For these reasons, elevators are often not enough on their own to provide all the pitch trim and pitch control required. Some aircraft use a variable incidence horizontal stabiliser and elevators, which just means that the whole tailplane moves in order to trim the aircraft and the elevators are a control surface on the back of this. Some aircraft go even further than this, and have something known as an \"all moving tailplane\", or \"all-flying tailplane\", and is also known as a \"slab tail\". This has no elevator surface at the back, and combines the trim and control inputs into a single movement that the whole tail makes. This is more efficient than using elevators only, as it is a large (full wing) surface making a small change, rather than smaller elevators making a large change, and this not only causes a lot less aerodynamic drag, but also requires less force from the aircraft's hydraulic systems. The reason less force is required to move the all-flying tailplane than elevators is because elevators are hinged at the front, whereas \"slab tails\" rotate around a point closer to the middle, and therefore the front of the tail helps the movement somewhat. Also, a much smaller movement is required, which does not \"fight\" the airflow as much, like an elevator does. This is why they may also be used on light aircraft to provide \"lighter\" stick forces, but on larger aircraft, the hydraulics are doing all the hard work anyway.",

However, they are not suitable for jet airplanes because of their large range of operating speeds, preference, for this type of airplane, is given to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer. There are two types of trim tab in common use: the variable and the fixed. The variable trim tabs may be manually or electrically controlled. If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up. This does not affect the static longitudinal stability. The moment required to move the primary control surface to the required position (MM) is equal to the force (FM) multiplied by the length of the arm (Am) from the hinge of the elevator to the center of pressure of the elevator main control surface. The same moment can be applied to the elevators by a smaller force (FT) in the opposite direction generated by a trim tab multiplied by the longer arm distance (AT) from the center of pressure of the trim tab to the elevator hinge-line. In other words, (FM × AM) = (FT × AT). The trim tab thereby does the work required to maintain the elevator out of the neutral position and there is no need for any force from the pilot’s controls.",

The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment. INBOARD AILERONS Ailerons are normally situated at the wing tips to give the greatest rolling moment for the force produced. However, this means they are also able to generate the maximum twisting loads on the wing. For instance, a down-going aileron will twist the wing tip and decrease wing tip incidence. The wing is not a rigid structure and any twist will cause a decrease of aileron effectiveness. As IAS increases, a down-going aileron will give more wing twist (decreased wing tip incidence). Eventually, an IAS will be reached at which the decrease in tip incidence will give a larger downforce than the upforce produced by the aileron. This is called high speed “aileron reversal”; the wing will go down, rather than up as the pilot intended. To reduce this effect, the ailerons could be mounted further inboard. Unfortunately, this would reduce aileron effectiveness at low speed. Alternatively, two sets of ailerons may be fitted: one set at the wing tips for use only at low speeds when the forces involved are low, and one set inboard for use at high speeds when the forces are greater and could cause greater structural distortion. Outboard (low speed) ailerons are “locked-out” as the flaps retract. At low speed both sets of ailerons work, but at high speed only the inboard ailerons respond to control input.",

In this case, the pilot is trimmed for a low speed (forget flap settings for now because they make things overly complicated but don't change the answer), which means being trimmed for a high angle of attack. In reality, the basis behind trimming is actually quite complicated, but in essence, we trim to balance the aircraft at a particular angle of attack, which equates to a speed (there are a lot of assumptions in that statement but it's fine for this question). When we accelerate from that speed, the aircraft will provide too much lift and pitch up naturally, this is where we would usually begin to trim down to decrease the angle of attack, but without a working trimmer, we have to hold it on the elevator control whilst out of the trimmed condition. Without an elevator, the aircraft will continue to pitch up until it stops accelerating. If there isn't a separate elevator, then the aircraft will have to be trimmed with speed using thrust, faster makes it pitch up, slower makes it pitch down. The aircraft will attempt to hold the same angle of attack, which loosely equates to a speed. It can be flown like this, but it would not be easy. This question seems like there is a separate trimmer to the elevator, so that should not be necessary.",

There is no direct link between the control column and the primary control surface. The function and operation of the servo-tab is the same as the balance tab and moves the trim tab in the opposite direction to the movement of the primary control surface. However, at low IAS the servo-tab makes the main control surface less effective. The position of a servo-controlled primary control surface cannot be determined until a positive pressure is applied to the servo-tab by the airflow. In flight, if a servo-controlled elevator jams the servo-tab reverses the direction of the pitch control input, because the elevator becomes part of the fixed horizontal stabilizer and the servo-tab now acts as a small elevator because despite its small size it has a longer moment arm than the elevator and consequently generates a large moment. Under normal circumstances an up servo-tab position would drive the elevator to a downward deflection causing the airplane’s nose to go down, but if the elevator is fixed the servo-tab in an up position will cause the airplane’s nose to move up.",

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and in the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is exactly what the question is referring to. Extra weight at the front of the aircraft will make the aircraft nose heavy, requiring nose-up stabiliser trim to feel the same. A nose up stabiliser trim is caused by providing extra downforce (or less lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a lower angle, with its leading edge pointing more downwards.",

These axes are at right angles to each other and all pass through the aircraft’s centre of gravity. The moment around an axis is produced by changing the aerodynamic force on the appropriate aerofoil. The magnitude of the force is a product of the dynamic pressure (IAS) and the angular displacement of the control surface. Aerodynamic force can be changed by: - adjusting the camber of the aerofoil. - changing the incidence of the aerofoil. - decreasing lift and increasing drag by “spoiling” the airflow. Changing the camber of any aerofoil (wing, tailplane or fin) will change its lift. Deflecting a control surface effectively changes its camber. AILERONS The primary effect of ailerons is to provide roll control about the longitudinal axis A downward movement of the aileron causes an increase in the effective angle of attack and a corresponding increase in lift, whilst an upward movement of the aileron causes a reduction in the effective angle of attack and a decrease in lift. The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment.",

This is known as the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or via email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can correct any differences and verify the answer, thank you! There are two scenarios that this could be. Faulty autopilot or trim runaway. A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is difficult to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. We would say that as the aircraft is already struggling to maintain altitude, disconnecting the autopilot is the best bet, and the pilots can switch off the electric trim and use the manual one if the problem has not been fixed.",

This causes “regulated” hydraulic pressure to provide a resistance or ‘feel’ on the pilot’s input controls proportional to IAS2, just as in a manual control. In addition, stick force should increase as stick displacement increases. An advantage of artificial feel is that it can be configured to provide envelope protection, which prevents the pilot over stressing the aircraft.

A Trimmable Horizontal Stabiliser (THS) enables a larger CG and speed range than a conventional tailplane with stabiliser, elevator and trim tab, because the whole stabiliser may be moved for trimming the aeroplane, instead of a relatively “small” elevator and trim tab only (a larger surface is much more effective). This also leads to more control difficulty due to a jammed stabiliser.

The pilot can control the stabiliser by using the trim wheel. If the linkage is mechanic or power-assisted, the neutral point of the control column changes with trim setting.

The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The limits of the hard protection prevent the pilot from exceeding the designed flight envelope of the aircraft. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

Towards the leading edge of the primary control top surface is pivoted a lever. The top of the lever is connected to the control column and the balance tab is connected to the same lever just above the pivot. Thus, movement of the control column is transmitted to the primary control surface but does not directly operate it. To ensure that the balance tab is only effective when it is required, the operating lever of the balance tab system is pivoted through a spring mounted on the elevator main control surface. This is the ‘spring tab.’ When the elevators are operated with at low airspeeds, the control column movement is fed directly to the primary control surface with no deflection of the balance tab so that there is no geometric movement between them. However, at higher speeds, one side of the spring is compressed and changes the geometric position of the balance tab relative to the main elevator control surface. The spring causes the tab to move in the opposite direction to the main control surface at an ever-increasing angle, which is directly proportional to the increasing airspeed. Thus, the spring tab assists the pilot by reducing the stick force required to operate the main control surface to a similar level for all airspeeds. At high IAS, the spring tab behaves like a servo-tab.",

Consequently, there is little control column load and there is a lack of feel to the controls. This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe. To counteract these characteristics and assist the pilot to use the control surfaces correctly it is necessary to have anti-balance tabs fitted. These operate in the opposite sense to the balance tab by deflecting the anti-balance tab in the same direction as that of the primary control surface and increase the aerodynamic loading. In small aircraft, it increases the control feel, and helps prevent you from over-controlling your aircraft's pitch.",

The forces and effectiveness of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) are greatly affected by the effective angle of attack of the oncoming airflow. This is not just the relative airflow around the whole aircraft as this air has been somewhat affected by the main wing ahead. The effective airflow aver the tailplane is mostly determined by the downwash from the wing. The main wing works by deflecting a large mass of air slightly downwards as it leaves the wing, so as the aircraft speeds up, there is greater airflow over the wing and that greater amount of air needs slightly less downwards deflection. As long as the right momentum change occurs, the aircraft will have the same amount of lift to counteract drag. This means that the angle of attack of the main wing is reduced, the coefficient of lift is reduced, etc., but most importantly for this question, the downwash angle is decreased. The tailplane often operates with a completely negative angle of attack, partly from the design and partly from this downwash from the main wing, in order to produce downforce to balance out the aircraft force couples and keep the aircraft nose up. This decrease in downwash means that the airflow arriving at the tailplane is \"flatter\" than before, i.e. it has less negative angle of attack.",

In Direct Control Law, all protections are lost and flying control input is translated directly into movement of the control surfaces without calculation or correction. The final degradation is Mechanical back-up. The aircraft is flown in pitch through use of the pitch trim wheel and roll by a mechanical connection retained to the rudder pedals (through the secondary effect of yaw). It is designed to allow the pilots to maintain control of the aircraft, while restoring flight control computers, after a complete power interruption. In the event of computer failure on a FBW aircraft, some form of back-up mode is required in the event of total computer failure.

This changes the moment from the aerodynamic surface acting on the aircraft, resulting in aircraft pitch, roll or yaw. The effectiveness of movement of these control surfaces increases with airspeed for a certain deflection. This happens because the deflection of the control surface changes the CL for the airfoil on which it operates. The effectiveness of surfaces operates through the lift formula (CL * ½ * ρ * V² * S). So, if CL increases, lift will also increase. In this question we are talking about a constant deflection, so CL will remain stable. Therefore, if we increase speed (v), lift will increase and so does the moment resulting from the control surface, increasing aeroplane manoeuvrability.",

Therefore, only small deflections are necessary when flying with high airspeeds and larger deflections at lower speeds. The lift equation states: LIFT = ½ρV2SCL CL = coefficient of lift. This represents angle of attack of the airfoil and the shape of the airfoil. This described in terms of thickness/chord ratio and a camber and can be altered in flight, for example, by lowering the flaps. ρ = The density of the air. For any given altitude during subsonic flight, the density may be considered to be constant. V2 = The velocity of the aircraft, squared. S = The wing area. The lift formula can also be rearranged and written as: LIFT = q × S × CL (q = dynamic pressure, i.e. ½ρ × V2). In the lift equation all factors except density and speed (TAS) are constant. At higher altitude ρ is reduced; therefore TAS (V) must be increased to maintain the same lift (= weight). Drag equation states that: DRAG = ½ρV2SCD ρ = the mass density of the fluid (rho), V = the velocity of the object relative to the air, S = the reference area, CD = the drag coefficient - a dimensionless constant. The drag formula can be rearranged and written as: DRAG = CD × ½ρ × V2 × S From the drag equation it is clear that drag is directly proportional to the frontal area: if it increases by a factor of e.g. 3 the drag will be increased by the same factor.",

While the question does not explicitly specify, it is presumed to pertain to asymmetric flight. In this scenario, the live engine generates a yawing moment on the dead engine, necessitating corrective action. The pivotal response involves applying rudder input to counteract the yaw induced by the engine failure. However, employing the rudder creates a sideslip, leading to increased drag. The offset rudder also generates a lateral force, exacerbating the sideslip. To mitigate these effects, banking (ailerons) towards the live engine is recommended. This banking maneuver reduces the required deflection of the rudder to maintain the desired track and minimize drag. It's crucial to note that a maximum banking angle of 5° towards the live engine is specified. This limitation is imposed to prevent larger bank angles, which could significantly diminish the vertical lift component.",

The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. To counteract adverse yaw the Frise ailerons are designed so that their leading edge produces sufficient profile drag on the upgoing aileron to equal the induced drag of the down going aileron and thus eliminate adverse yaw.",

Creating an unstable situation. To counteract this, a pitch-down moment must be created. Therefore, the elevator must be deflected downwards. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

            "explanation": "The question is very simple but includes some sections outside of the syllabus, which we can mostly ignore, as they don't affect the answer. All aircraft have limitations to their speed and the loads that they can sustain at those speeds. In particular, we have to know about the load/speed diagram for CS-25 (large) aeroplanes. There is a diagram for the maximum load factors (positive and negative) that an aircraft can sustain, whether that limit was to do with a stall limit, or a structural load factor limit. There is also a limiting gust envelope diagram for the maximum gusts an aircraft must be able to handle at various speeds, see annex above. This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. There is also a flight demonstrated design dive speed (VDF) which is a demonstrated speed that the aircraft can handle without associated vibrations, buffet or flutter. It is different from VD but for the purposes of this question we do not need to know any more about it. To keep the aircraft within safe operation, the VMO (maximum operating speed) must be kept below VC. This is still very fast, and should not be exceeded in normal operations. This means that it is always sufficiently less than from VD/MD and VDF/MDF. CS 25.1505 Maximum operating limit speed The maximum operating limit speed (VMO/MMO, airspeed or Mach number, whichever is critical at a particular altitude) is a speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or descent), unless a higher speed is authorised for flight test or pilot training operations. VMO/MMO must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising speed VC and so that it is sufficiently below VD/MD or VDF/MDF, to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations. The speed margin between VMO/MMO and VD/MD or VDF/MDF may not be less than that determined under CS 25.335(b) or found necessary during the flight tests conducted under CS 25.253.",

            "explanation": "This question is ambiguous and the answer depends on the interpretation of the question text. There are two possible scenarios: If the question is referring to different aircraft classes (CS 25 vs CS 23), then a light aircraft (CS 23) has a maximum limiting load factor of 3.8 g, whereas a heavy aircraft (CS 25) has a maximum limiting load factor of 2.5 g. In this case, the heavy aircraft will reach its limiting load at a lower value than that of a lighter aircraft. If the question is referring to the same aircraft with a change in mass (for instance, due to fuel consumption), then the limiting load factor is attained at the same value regardless of mass. This is most likely what the question is referring to. Let's consider the following scenario: A Boeing 737 (CS 25) takes off with a mass of 200 tonnes and is limited to a maximum load factor of 2.5 g, which would create a certain amount of stress on the wings if applied. After several hours and using most of its fuel, the aircraft's mass is reduced to 100 tonnes. Applying 2.5 g at this lower mass would create a lower amount of stress on the wings. In theory, the lighter aircraft could withstand more \"g\" before the stress reached the same level as during takeoff. However, in practice, a CS25 aircraft is certified to a maximum load factor of 2.5 g regardless of its mass. Therefore, the limiting load factor is still 2.5 g, regardless of the aircraft's current mass. For the CS-25 category, the maximum positive and minimum negative limitation of load factor is: nMAX = 2.5; nMIN = -1 in clean configuration (high lift devices not extended) The CS-23 category includes three subparts: Normal [N] nMAX = 3.8 nMIN = -1.52 Utility [U] nMAX = 4.4 nMIN = -1.76 Aerobatic [A] nMAX ≥ 6 nMIN ≤ 3",

The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. Vertical gusts will affect the load factor (n) by changing the angle of attack of the wing. For a given gust speed and aircraft TAS, the increment in the load factor depends on the increase in CL per change in angle of attack due to the gust (the slope of the lift curve). If the lift curve has a steep slope, the ‘g’ increment will be greater. Factors which affect the lift curve are aspect ratio and wing sweep. Wings having a low aspect ratio, or sweep, will have a lower lift curve slope, and so will give a smaller increase in ‘g’ when meeting a given gust at a given TAS. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft. For a given TAS and gust speed, the increase of lift will be proportional to the wing area. Therefore, the increase in load factor is inversely proportional to the wing loading. Wing Loading = Weight/(Wing Area) Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

            "explanation": "A gust is a localized sudden and rapid change to the speed of the air in the atmosphere that can be either horizontal or vertical. The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft. For a given TAS and gust speed, the increase of lift will be proportional to the wing area. Therefore, the increase in load factor is inversely proportional to the wing loading. Wing Loading = Weight/(Wing Area) Decreasing mass, decreases wing loading which increases load factor. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. With increasing altitude, density decreases and any aerodynamic force resulting from a gust will be smaller. Thus, when comparing two aircraft flying at different altitudes, the one flying in thicker air (lower altitude) will experience an increased increment in load factor following a gust. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

The speeds are as follows: VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of at least 66 fps (feet per second). VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. Obviously you can see that the gust envelope starts at 1G and 0 kt, but at zero knots where the aircraft is stalled of course, so the envelope actually starts at the stall speed curve, between where the gust lines intersect the curve. Yes, this question is very poorly worded but we can see what the examiner means and it is based off early feedback yet so more is required, hopefully it will be slightly better worded in the exam.",

We have recently changed the answer to this due to feedback. We find this question very odd, because \"0.9 x VD\" can be a range of values (as VD can be a range of values), and there are other factors to the calculation of VNE that you can see in the CS23 specifications below (CS25 aircraft do not have a VNE). Also, we think the examiner is very misleading to include \"VD\" as an option, as it is certainly correct (VNE is always less than VD), but is less specific than \"0.9 x VD\", making it tough to decide between \"less specific but absolutely correct\" and \"more specific but more complex to justify\" answers. Please keep on sending any exam feedback you have, and we will keep these questions as up to date as we can for you, thanks! Each type of aircraft has its own specific flight envelope, within which it can be safely operated in accordance with the EASA Certification Specifications. This is represented on a velocity against load factor, or V-n diagram. The high-speed limit for many (but not all) CS-23 aircraft is the never exceed speed (VNE) and is a design reference point for the aircraft beyond which the aircraft must not be flown. It provides a safety margin with the point at which structural damage or failure may occur(VD). VNE is the red radial line at the high speed end of the airspeed indicator. Never Exceed Speed VNE: VNE is set below VD to allow for speed upsets to be recovered before reaching any point of possible damage. VNE equals 0.9 x VD in most cases, but please see the regulation for this below, as there is some \"wiggle room\" in the regulation that makes things slightly more complex (hence our unhappiness with these options). CS 23.1505 - Airspeed Limitations (a) The never-exceed speed VNE must be established so that it is – (1) Not less than 0.9 times the minimum value of VD allowed under CS 23.335; and (2) Not more than the lesser of – (i) 0.9 VD established under CS 23.335; or (ii) 0.9 times the maximum speed shown under CS 23.251.",

The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. It can be defined by: load factor(n) = (Lift(L)) / (Weight(W)) In straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, thus n = 1. In this exercise, the increment in CL from a gust will be of 0.1 for every degree of angle of attack impacted by the gust. We also know that the aircraft encounters a gust which increases its angle of attack by 3°. In straight and level flight n = 1 or : n = 0.47 / 0.47 A 3° increase in angle of attack, 3 * 0.1 = 0.3 Will give an increment of 0.3 in the CL : 0.47+0.3 = 0.77 A gust which increases the angle of attack by 3° will increase the load factor to : n = 0.77 / 0.47 ≈ 1.64g",

The tailplane provides the largest contribution toward damping in pitch, although other aircraft components such as the wings do assist. A graph of stick force versus load factor illustrates the manoeuvring stability of an aircraft. The gradient of the graph should be positive (with increasing load factor the stick force must also increase). This gradient must not be excessively high or the aircraft would be difficult and tiring to manoeuvre. Conversely, it should not be too low or the stick forces would be too light and the aircraft could be over-stressed. The maximum load factors which must be allowed for during maneuvers are shown in an envelope of load factor against speed (EAS). If a higher limit load factor is set by the manufacturer, there's more margin for the aircraft to be controlled inside the envelope and therefore a lower stick force per g may be set. Statement I is correct. The limit load factors will depend on the design category of the aircraft. For example, the limit load factor for modern high-speed jet transport aircraft is -1.0 g and 2.5 g. This value is stated in the Aircraft Flight Manual to be consulted by the pilot and should bever be exceeded. However, the stick force per g is not listed in the AFM. Statement II is incorrect.",

TAS = EAS / √σ where, σ is Relative Density. The Airspeed Indicator is calibrated for ‘standard’ sea level density, so it will only read TAS if the density of the air through which the aircraft is flying is 1.225 kg/m3. Thus at 40 000 ft where the ‘standard’ density is one quarter of the sea-level value, to maintain the same EAS the aircraft will have to move through the air twice as fast. As altitude increases the TAS at any given CAS increases, so the effect of a vertical gust decreases. At 40 000 ft ISA for example, the TAS at constant EAS is about twice its sea level value. The upgust will change the direction of the relative undisturbed airflow approaching the wing by roughly half as much.",

Vold = 1.8VS nold = 1.9g Vnew = 2VS nnew =? The first thing we should do is check if in the first situation the aircraft is stalled, by comparing the two VS0: VS1 = VS0 x √(nold) VS1 = √1.9 x VS0 = 1.38VS0 1.38VS0 < 1.8VS0 Therefore, the aircraft is not stalled! As the aircraft does not stall in the first situation, we can calculate the load factor resulting from the same gust on an aircraft travelling at Vnew using a direct proportion: Vold x (nnew−1) = Vnew x (nold−1) nnew = ((Vnew x (nold−1)) / Vold) +1 nnew = ((2VS x (1.9−1)) / 1.8VS) +1 nnew = 2.00g Encountering the same gust with a speed of 2VS the load factor will be 2.00g. The last step of the exercise is to assess the limiting load factor at which the aircraft would stall and conclude if the new load factor calculated would be reached or the aircraft would stall before that. To do this, let us compare Vnew with the stall speed (VS) and load factor in straight and level flight (n1g): Vnew = VS * √(n1g From here results that our limiting load factor is: n1g = V2new n1g = 4.00g As our limiting load factor is higher than the new. In this case encountering the gust the aircraft would have its load factor increased to 2.00g without stalling.",

We have had to choose some figures to fit an answer, which are unlikely to be the same in the exam! Please send us any further exam feedback you can remember if you get this in your exam, so we can make it more exact, thank you! An aircraft has a limit load factor, that signifies the maximum G-force that the aircraft can handle, before potential damage may occur to the airframe. VA is an aircraft's manoeuvring speed, and exists where the aircraft can handle exactly its limit load factor before stalling. If the aircraft is flying slower than VA, then it will stall before reaching the limit load factor, and if it flying above VA, the limit load factor can be exceeded before stalling. We can therefore use VA in calculations, as it is the stall speed of an aircraft at it's limit load factor. Stall speed calculations are based on the lift force required by the wings, and that varies with weight and load factor (G-force). The higher the weight, or the higher the load factor, the higher airspeed that is required (more airflow makes the wing able to produce greater forces before stalling). For load factor, the formula is: New VS = VS(1G) x sqrt(load factor) Where VS(1G) is the stall speed at 1G (straight level flight) So for the manoeuvring speed VA = VS(1G) x sqrt(limit load factor) We can then re-arrange this to find the limit load factor if we know the VA and the VS(1G) (which we do in this question). The VS(1G) is given in the question as the bottom of the green arc. (VA / VS(1G))2 = limit load factor Limit load factor = (147/73)2 = 4.06 G",

Yellow This arc extends from VNO to VNE (never exceed speed), and denotes the cautionary speed range. Operations within this speed range should not be carried out except in smooth air. Red Radial line This line marks VNE. MANOEUVERING SPEED (VA) (figure 2) VA - Maximum design manoeuvring speed and is the highest speed where the aircraft will stall before it exceeds the maximum load factor THE STALL The CL of an aerofoil increases with angle of attack up to a maximum (CLMAX). Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALL RECOVERY To recover from a stall or prevent a full stall, the angle of attack must be decreased to reduce the adverse pressure gradient. This may consist of merely releasing back pressure, or it may be necessary to smoothly move the pitch control forward, depending on the aircraft design and severity of the stall. Allow airspeed to increase and recover lost altitude with moderate back pressure on the pitch control. Pulling too hard could trigger a secondary stall, or worse, could exceed the limit load factor and damage the aircraft structure. At low airspeeds the stall may occur before reaching the limit load factor. That is why, when pulling from a stall recovery, keeping the speed between VS and VA will allow us to not stall again due to the increased load factor. As angle of attack reduces below the critical angle, the adverse pressure gradient will decrease, airflow will re-attach, and lift and drag will return to their normal values.",

Flaps are incredibly useful for aircraft to allow for slower take-off and landing, as well as increasing drag for increased control during descent and approach phases of flight, and changing the landing pitch attitude of some aircraft. They do have to sustain some very high aerodynamic loads though, as they stick out into the airstream below the wing, and produce very high forces of lift and drag. The maximum speed for flaps extended (VFE) therefore exists to make sure the pilots do not fly too fast with flaps extended, and cause damage to the flaps or their mechanisms. Some large aircraft actually have systems to reduce the flap extension when these speed limits are broken. In this question then, during the approach phase of flight, the pilots will be wanting to extend flaps in preparation for landing, but if the speed is too high and the pilots extend flaps anyway, they may exceed the new (lower) VFE for the increased flap setting. As for the other options: VLO is the maximum speed for landing gear operation (it is often specified whether that is for extension or retraction) VMO is the maximum operating IAS for the aircraft. VS is the stall speed (not specified which).",

We have recently changed the answer to this due to feedback. We find this question very odd, because \"0.9 x VD\" can be a range of values (as VD can be a range of values), and there are other factors to the calculation of VNE that you can see in the CS23 specifications below (CS25 aircraft do not have a VNE). Also, we think the examiner is very misleading to include \"VD\" as an option, as it is certainly correct (VNE is always less than VD), but is less specific than \"0.9 x VD\", making it tough to decide between \"less specific but absolutely correct\" and \"more specific but more complex to justify\" answers. Please keep on sending any exam feedback you have, and we will keep these questions as up to date as we can for you, thanks! Each type of aircraft has its own specific flight envelope, within which it can be safely operated in accordance with the EASA Certification Specifications. This is represented on a velocity against load factor, or V-n diagram. The high-speed limit for many (but not all) CS-23 aircraft is the never exceed speed (VNE) and is a design reference point for the aircraft beyond which the aircraft must not be flown. It provides a safety margin with the point at which structural damage or failure may occur(VD). VNE is the red radial line at the high speed end of the airspeed indicator. Never Exceed Speed VNE: VNE is set below VD to allow for speed upsets to be recovered before reaching any point of possible damage. VNE equals 0.9 x VD in most cases, but please see the regulation for this below, as there is some \"wiggle room\" in the regulation that makes things slightly more complex (hence our unhappiness with these options). CS 23.1505 - Airspeed Limitations (a) The never-exceed speed VNE must be established so that it is – (1) Not less than 0.9 times the minimum value of VD allowed under CS 23.335; and (2) Not more than the lesser of – (i) 0.9 VD established under CS 23.335; or (ii) 0.9 times the maximum speed shown under CS 23.251.",

Please let us know which you get in the exam, by placing feedback in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Aircraft can be certified under 2 different certification specifications; CS-23 or CS-25. CS-23 covers \"small aircraft\". This includes aircraft with MTOW of 5670 kg or less and a maximum operational passenger seating configuration (MOPSC) of 9 or fewer. CS-23 also covers commuter category aircraft up to 8618 kg MTOW and a MOPSC of 19 or fewer. This means that there are CS-23 aircraft with an MTOW above 5670 kg. CS-25 covers \"large aircraft\". Specifically, \"turbine powered Large Aeroplanes\". This includes turboprop aircraft as well as turbojet/turbofan (jet aircraft). There is a difference between the limiting flight airspeeds, VNE and VMO/MMO. Some aircraft (usually smaller, slower aircraft) use VNE - the never exceed speed, and a corresponding VNO, the normal operating speed, which should only be exceeded in smooth air (bottom of the yellow arc). Larger/faster aircraft use VMO/MMO - the maximum operating speed/maximum operating Mach number. This is calculated a little differently to VNE, and is a speed that should not be exceeded during normal operations. An aircraft either has VNE or VMO/MMO, never both. If an aircraft uses VMO, it will also have a corresponding MMO, but this is not mentioned in this question CS-23 aircraft mostly use VNE, but turbine powered aeroplanes and those with a particular design dive speed instead use a VMO/MMO (CS 23.1505). Therefore, CS-23 aircraft can use either VNE or VMO/MMO, depending on the particular aircraft. CS-25 aircraft only use VMO/MMO. Now we have enough information to go through each option: \"Only jet aeroplanes have a VMO.\" No, there are turboprop aircraft within CS-25 (and CS-23) that also have VMO, and even the possibility for piston aircraft to have VMO under CS-23 in some cases (CS 23.1505). \"VNE applies to all aircraft with an MTOW less than 5 670 kg.\" No, there are aircraft under 5 670 kg with more than 9 passenger seats that would be under CS-25 (and therefore have a VMO) and there are also aircraft within CS-23 that use VMO (CS 23.1505). \"VNE only applies to CS-23 aircraft but NOT to CS-25 aircraft.\" Yes, the majority of CS-23 aircraft use a VNE (but not all), and CS-25 aircraft only use VMO, so do not use VNE at all. \"VMO only applies to CS-25 aircraft but NOT to CS-23 aircraft.\" No. Whilst all CS-25 aircraft do use a VMO, so do some aircraft certified under CS-23 (turbines and certain piston aircraft [CS 23.1505])",

This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed.",

(c) Manoeuvring load factors lower than those specified in this paragraph may be used if the aeroplane has design features that make it impossible to exceed these values in flight.

An aircraft is subject to many aerodynamic excitations (gusts, control inputs, etc.) and the aerodynamic forces at various speeds have characteristic properties for rate of change of force and moment. The aerodynamic forces may interact with the structure and may excite (or negatively damp) the natural modes of the structure and allow flutter. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope and the natural modes must be damped if possible or designed to occur beyond VD / MD. DESIGN DIVE SPEED (VD) Point ‘D’ in the V-n Diagram (figure 1) is the design dive speed VD. This is the maximum speed which has to be considered when assessing the strength of the aircraft. It is based on the principle of an upset occurring when the aircraft is flying at VC, resulting in a shallow dive, during which the speed increases, until recovery is effected.

Flutter is an oscillation caused by interaction of aerodynamic forces, structural elasticity and inertial effects. Flutter happens when the eigenfrequencies of two oscillations move close together so their motions can reinforce themselves mutually. When that happens, then the amplitude will increase with each oscillation, up to a point where the amplitude is big enough to break things. Flutter is a very dangerous condition; if it is not stopped, it can cause structural failure and potentially lead to a fatal accident. There are four ways to stop flutter. Limit the flight envelope; immediately leave the speed at which flutter is possible Increase damping; this can be done by for instance adding some friction Increase stiffness; this reduces eigenfrequencies which makes flutter less likely Reduce mass; If a wing is made lighter, the eigenfrequency will move up, increasing flutter speeds.",

VA is the design manoeuvring speed at which the aircraft will stall when achieving its maximum load factor, i.e. it is the stalling speed of an aircraft at its Limit Load Factor (\"g\" limit) with flaps retracted. On an aircraft, where only one VA is published, maximum mass is assumed. In practice, like any stalling speed, VA will change during flight, decreasing as fuel is burnt and mass reduces. The significance of VA is that below this speed, the pilot can apply full elevator deflection and the aircraft will stall before reaching its \"g\" limit. But above VA, it becomes possible to exceed the \"g\" limit and there is risk of overstressing and deforming the airframe. For an aerobatic aircraft, the \"g\" limit is 6g. For this question, VA is given by the stall speed formula with flaps retracted: VA = VS1 x √(Limit Load Factor) = 57 x √6 = 140 kt.

Above approximately FL270, the airplane is MMO restricted to 0.86 Mach. Therefore, 350 KIAS/0.86M defines VMO/MMO for this airplane respectively. VMO – is expressed in CAS, which is usually associated with operations at lower altitudes and deals with structural loads and flutter; MMO – is expressed in Mach number, is associated with operations at higher altitudes and is usually more concerned with compressibility effects and flutter.",

            "explanation": "VA is the design manoeuvring speed of an aircraft. It is better depicted on a diagram of speed vs load factor (V - n diagram). The aircraft has a limiting load factor, an amount of acceleration that it can take without permanently damaging the airframe. Every aircraft also has a stalling curve, which dictates at what speed the aircraft will stall, when pulling a certain load factor. Put these two together on a diagram and you can see the V - n envelope of the aircraft, how fast we can fly and how many Gs we can pull at a particular speed. VA sits around where the positive stall curve touches the limit load factor. It dictates the point where you can pull the controls as hard as you want, and just as you reach the limit load factor (structural damage point), the aircraft will then stall, removing the chance of structural damage. Any slower and you will stall first, and any faster, and you could permanently damage the airframe. It is not always perfectly on that corner of the diagram, but that is past the scope of this question To look at all the options \"The speed for maximum gust velocity.\" No. The speed for maximum gust velocity is VB, and occurs just above the VA. It is the speed that the aircraft is certified to handle the highest level of gusts (66 fps). \"A specifically designated speed to use when penetrating turbulence.\" The turbulence penetration speed is actually VB also, where the strongest gusts can be handled by the aircraft without stalling or damage occurring. \"A speed chosen by the manufacturer for evaluating performance criteria.\" There are many different speed to evaluate performance criteria with, but they would never use VA, as it is not usually anywhere near speeds such as best range, minimum drag, etc. \"The design manoeuvring speed, at or near which rapid, full control reversal should be avoided due to risk of damage to aircraft.\" Whilst the wording is (intentionally) poor for this option, it is the only one left. We believe that the \"control reversal\" would just mean going from one full deflection to the other side full deflection. That is really not advisable at any speed, but at and above VA would cause damage to the aircraft. Even just below VA, full control deflection from no deflection is fine (though you may stall), but reversal is not accounted for in the regulations, so in reality the examiner can say what they like to try and confuse you. This is the only remaining option, and correctly stated that it is the design manoeuvring speed, so we are happy to agree that it is most correct.",

The aircraft has a limiting load factor, an amount of acceleration that it can take without permanently damaging the airframe. Every aircraft also has a stalling curve, which dictates at what speed the aircraft will stall, when pulling a certain load factor. Put these two together on a diagram and you can see the V - n envelope of the aircraft, how fast we can fly and how many Gs we can pull at a particular speed, either limited by aerodynamic stall or by the structural limit load factor. VA sits around where the positive stall curve touches the limit load factor. It dictates the point where you can pull the controls as hard as you want, and just as you reach the limit load factor (structural damage point), the aircraft will then stall, removing the chance of structural damage. Any slower and you will stall first, and any faster, and you could permanently damage the airframe. It is not always perfectly on that corner of the diagram, but that is past the scope of this question. If the mass of an aircraft increases, it means that the aircraft requires more lift, and therefore the stall speed increases. When the stall speed increases, so does the manoeuvring speed (VA) by the same proportion. The design limit load factor, however, is fixed for an aircraft by the manufacturer, at a certain G-loading.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 081.06.02.02.03: Explain why VA loses significance at higher altitude. Manoeuvring speed (VA) is defined as the calibrated airspeed (CAS) below which the aircraft will stall before the onset of structural damage or aerodynamic buffeting occurs. It is a function of the aircraft's weight, altitude, and the configuration of the aircraft (flap and landing gear positions). VA is calculated based on EAS, which is the airspeed corrected for instrument and position errors. When jet transports cruise at high altitude, the significance of manoeuvring speed (VA) diminishes since it is not possible to achieve 2.5 g, or similar load factors, at high altitude. Consequently, when a single VA is published, it only applies to low-level flight. As altitude increases, the values of equivalent airspeed (EAS) that correspond to the same Mach numbers increase. The increase in Mach number results in a reduction in CLMAX, and the stall limit curves become shallower, causing both VS1 and VA to occur at higher EAS values. The increased stall speed (VS) means that the low altitude VA is around the low-speed stall at high altitude. Therefore, the option \"higher stall speed and low control forces make it easier to produce a high load factor at high altitudes.\" is more likely correct, as flying the low altitude VA at high altitudes may result in a low-speed stall of a typical jet aircraft rather than a shock stall.

We are in need of more feedback about this one, so please send us anything you can remember from the exam via the comments, the feedback section of the website, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct or not. Authority Reported Answer Hungary Not C Poland B Austro Not D We would say if your country is not Hungary or Poland, go for C. FLUTTER Flutter occurs because a wing (or other aerodynamic surface) is not perfectly stiff, and will bend and twist under high aerodynamic loads. The control surfaces can cause a cyclic movement where the wing moves but the control surface \"lags behind\", creating an even larger force on the wing. The wing will then do the same thing in the opposite direction, and at certain frequencies can build up to a large, short term oscillation that can cause significant damage ton the aircraft. The risk of experiencing flutter increases with IAS. A control surface oscillation can also be intensified or created by any slack (free play) in the control lines, where the control surface can move freely without pilot input. This means that small disturbances such as turbulence could cause un-commanded control surface movements, which then begin a period of flutter, as eluded to in the question. To go through the options: \"This phugoid-type oscillation is likely to increase in magnitude and the aeroplane may enter a stall or encounter an overspeed situation if the oscillation worsens.\" It is not a phugoid type oscillation being described, as a phugoid has a greater time period than this short interval flutter. \"A poorly balanced control surface is creating excessive restoring forces and this short-period motion may cause excessive stress on the airframe.\" The control surface is not necessarily poorly balanced; the cause of the flutter is the free play in the control lines, so we would say this is not correct. However, the rest of the option is correct, so it's not far off. \"The flutter may gradually worsen, and the elevator may vibrate so vigorously that it comes off the hinges and separates from the aeroplane in flight.\" We believe this is fully correct. The free play in the control lines can cause this kind of response. \"Compared to a phugoid, the short period motion leads to a change in pitch and speed, which, if NOT corrected, may lead to a stall or overspeed situation.\" For a while, the Polish ULC considered this to be correct (we believe), but recent feedback indicates they no longer do. The short period motion doesn't really cause large speed changes (that would be a phugoid) and therefore it is not very likely to cause a stall or overspeed situation.",

If the aircraft is flying slower than VA, then it will stall before reaching the limit load factor, and if it flying above VA, the limit load factor can be exceeded before stalling. We can therefore use VA in calculations, as it is the stall speed of an aircraft at it's limit load factor. Stall speed calculations are based on the lift force required by the wings, and that varies with weight and load factor (G-force). The higher the weight, or the higher the load factor, the higher airspeed that is required (more airflow makes the wing able to produce greater forces before stalling). For load factor, the formula is: New VS = VS(1G) x sqrt(load factor) Where VS(1G) is the stall speed at 1G (straight level flight) So for the manoeuvring speed VA = VS(1G) x sqrt(limit load factor) We can then re-arrange this to find the limit load factor if we know the VA and the VS(1G) (which we do in this question). The VS(1G) is given in the question as the bottom of the green arc. (VA / VS(1G))2 = limit load factor Limit load factor = (133/73)2 = 3.3 G",

All aircraft have limitations to their speed and the loads that they can sustain at those speeds. In particular, we have to know about the load/speed diagram for CS-25 (large) aeroplanes. There is a diagram for the maximum load factors (positive and negative) that an aircraft can sustain, whether that limit was to do with a stall limit, or a structural load factor limit. There is also a limiting gust envelope diagram for the maximum gusts an aircraft must be able to handle at various speeds, see annex above. This creates some set design speeds for the aircraft, such as VA, VB, VC and VD. VA - Manoeuvring Speed, the speed where the aircraft will stall at exactly the limiting load factor (2.5 G for CS-25 aircraft). VB - Design Speed for Maximum Gust Intensity, the speed where an aircraft must be able to manage a gust of up to 66 fps. VC - Design Cruise Speed, the maximum speed an aircraft is able to cruise at, giving sufficient safety margin to VD, and means the aircraft will not exceed VD if a particular disturbance occurs when cruising at VC. It is also the point where gusts of up to 50 fps should be managed by the airframe. VC should not be more than 0.8 x VD. VD - Design Dive Speed, the maximum speed that the aircraft can handle in a dive, often limited by vibrations, buffet or flutter. This is the absolute speed limit of the airframe, and the aircraft should be able to manage 25 fps gusts at this speed. To keep the aircraft within safe operation, the VMO (maximum operating speed) must be kept below VC. This is still very fast, and should not be exceeded in normal operations.",

The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. It can be defined by: load factor(n) = (Lift(L))/(Weight(W)) In straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, thus n = 1.

            "explanation": "A gust is a localized sudden and rapid change to the speed of the air in the atmosphere that can be either horizontal or vertical. The horizontal gust is of little importance because it causes a change to an airplane’s dynamic pressure that results in an insignificant change to the load factor. The vertical gusts are far more important because they change the effective angle of attack, total lift, and the load factor. The gust load is the extra load imparted to the airplane by vertical gusts or turbulence. Its magnitude is unaffected by increased altitude but is increased with increased aspect ratio and/or decreased mass. The load factor for any given angle of attack can be derived from the basic load factor for the normal cruise angle of attack because it is increased by the same percentage as the increase of angle of attack. The load factor deriving from a gust is determined by the magnitude of the vertical velocity of the gust and the forward speed of the airplane. High wing loading reduces the ‘g’ increment in a gust. This is because the lift increment produced is a smaller proportion of the original lift force for the more heavily loaded aircraft. For a given TAS and gust speed, the increase of lift will be proportional to the wing area. Therefore, the increase in load factor is inversely proportional to the wing loading. WingLoading = Weight/(WingArea) Decreasing mass, decreases wing loading which increases load factor. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. With increasing altitude, density decreases and any aerodynamic force resulting from a gust will be smaller. Thus, when comparing two aircraft flying at different altitudes, the one flying in thinner air (higher altitude) will experience a decreased increment in load factor following a gust. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.",

In the descent the reverse is true. Your maximum speed is controlled by MMO first, and then by VMO at lower altitudes. Alternatively, LSS increases during the descent, due to the rising temperature. Therefore, TAS must increase during descent to maintain constant Mach No. IAS is also increasing and will eventually reach its limit.

            "explanation": "Aircraft can be certified under 2 different certification specifications; CS-23 or CS-25. CS-23 covers \"small aircraft\". This includes aircraft with MTOW of 5670 kg or less and a maximum operational passenger seating configuration (MOPSC) of 9 or fewer. CS-23 also covers commuter category aircraft up to 8618 kg MTOW and a MOPSC of 19 or fewer. This means that there are CS-23 aircraft with an MTOW above 5670 kg. CS-25 covers \"large aircraft\". Specifically, \"turbine powered Large Aeroplanes\". This includes turboprop aircraft as well as turbojet/turbofan (jet aircraft). There is a difference between the limiting flight airspeeds, VNE and VMO/MMO. Some aircraft (usually smaller, slower aircraft) use VNE - the never exceed speed, and a corresponding VNO, the normal operating speed, which should only be exceeded in smooth air (bottom of the yellow arc). Larger/faster aircraft use VMO/MMO - the maximum operating speed/maximum operating Mach number. This is calculated a little differently to VNE, and is a speed that should not be exceeded during normal operations. An aircraft either has VNE or VMO/MMO, never both. If an aircraft uses VMO, it will also have a corresponding MMO, but this is not mentioned in this question CS-23 aircraft mostly use VNE, but turbine powered aeroplanes and those with a particular design dive speed instead use a VMO/MMO (CS 23.1505). Therefore, CS-23 aircraft can use either VNE or VMO/MMO, depending on the particular aircraft. CS-25 aircraft only use VMO/MMO.",

It is not less than the stalling speed with the flaps retracted multiplied by the square root of the limiting load factor at a speed of VC. VA is not shown on the ASI, but it should be placarded close to the ASI. For a normal category light airplane having a maximum load factor of 3.8g then: VA = VS1G ∗ √3.8 = 1.95VS1G If only one value of VA is quoted, then it is the speed at which the airplane will stall at the maneuvering load factor at the MTOM. Because of this, a change of mass causes the value of VA to alter by a percentage amount equal to approximately half of the percentage mass change. An alternative calculation that may be required because of a mass change is that: VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √( (New Mass) / (Original Mass) ) In this exercise, the ‘New Mass’ is 20% smaller than the ‘Original Mass’, which is the same as saying that New Mass=80% Original Mass. VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √( (0.8∗Original Mass) / (Original Mass) ) VA(New Mass) = VA(Original Mass) ∗ √0.8 VA(New Mass) ≈ 0.9VA(Original Mass) The new VA with a mass 20% smaller corresponds to 90% of the original VA, i.e. VA will decrease by approximately 10%.",

The maximum IAS at which the landing gear should be extended or retracted (sometimes there are separate speed for extension and retraction). The operation of the landing gear is often more susceptible to input from the aerodynamic loads than when the gear is fully extended and locked. In particular, the gear doors may have to move within the airflow, or the gear may have to be raised or lowered into the oncoming airflow. For example, in the common multi-engine trainer, the DA42, the nose gear extends backwards, and raises forwards into the airflow. The VLE and VLO (extend) are the same, but the VLO (retract) is around 40 kts lower, as the aerodynamic loads would be working against the hydraulic system when raising into the airflow.",

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

This would increase lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but descend in the atmosphere, the higher air density means that we have to fly slower to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is a decrease in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with decreased altitude. As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with a decrease in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the left, due to the decreased TAS for the same IAS at lower altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 2, moving to the left.",

Given other questions in the database which have been confirmed, we have decided to change the options to make one \"actually correct\", rather than the very questionable previous options, which were never fully verified. This question could have even been removed from EASA's database by now, but we also cannot guarantee that. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect of spoilers on the critical angle of attack is much more complex (and explained where necessary in different questions), and unpredictable, but EASA appear to say that it increases with spoiler deployment (opposite to how it decreases when trailing edge flaps are deployed). As far as we are aware, it could actually increase or decrease slightly in real life, dependent on the wing, spoiler size and location, and particularly the amount of spoiler extension. For this question though, mercifully, the answer remains the same. ANSWERING THE QUESTION The question asks about the angle of attack of the wing. When spoilers are extended, the lift decreases, so without any change to the angle of attack, then the aircraft will no longer be in equilibrium, so in reality, to counteract weight, the angle of attack of the wing has to increase. This agrees with our experience of flying jets, in when we extend spoilers, the aircraft pitches up slightly. The margin to the stall is a very vague term, as it could mean the difference between current speed and stall speed, but it is more likely to mean in terms of angle of attack, and in this case, would probably be the difference between the aircraft's current angle of attack and the critical angle of attack (AoA). When spoilers are extended, the actual AoA is forced to increase to maintain the flight path, and the critical angle of attack will either decrease slightly (according to some other sources) or increase slightly (according to EASA's other questions), but either way, the increase in current AoA will likely be much greater, so the margin to stall will decrease.",

Therefore, being close to the ground decreases downwash and decreases induced drag. This is called ground effect. Ground effect increases as an aircraft flies closer to the ground, so the lowest height would give the lowest induced drag. Obviously then, the highest induced drag would occur when at the greatest height above the ground. Ground effect is usually cited as taking effect at approximately half the wingspan of height (which would be 30 ft here), as that is when it becomes significant and noticeable, but as with everything in aerodynamics, it is not a binary effect (on or off), it is a gradual change, so the correct answer here is simply the greatest height.",

This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above and left of the origin.

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V2) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. A big consideration for this question is the scenario. We are at the critical AoA and we raise the speedbrakes. Of course, we will begin to descend as the drag increases, unless we add thrust. if we don't do either of these things then the aircraft will quickly stall, but initially, assuming the angle of attack remains constant, the speedbrake extension should slightly delay the stall to a higher AoA.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Parasite drag is made up out of pressure drag, friction drag and interference drag. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

Winglets are small vertical aerofoils that are integrated into the wingtip. These generate a slight forward force and disrupt the airflow from the lower to the upper surface of the wing, diminishing the intensity of the wingtip vortex. Both effects contribute to a reduction in induced drag. Let's examine the remaining options and discuss why they are incorrect: \"Slat extension, at a constant angle of attack and normal extension speeds, will increase the lift coefficient, which will also increase the induced drag coefficient.\" Incorrect. At a constant aircraft angle of attack, the extension of slats decreases the angle of attack on the specific wing section, preventing an increase in the lift coefficient (CL). The advantage of slats becomes evident when the aircraft's angle of attack is subsequently increased. \"Sweepback reduces drag since, compared with a straight wing of equal area, the span increases.\" Incorrect. Sweepback actually reduces the wingspan, thereby lowering the aspect ratio and increasing induced drag. \"Vortex generators on the wing partially block the spanwise flow over the wing, leading to a reduction in induced drag.\" Incorrect. Vortex generators are designed to energize the boundary layer, but they typically contribute to increased drag rather than inducing a reduction in induced drag.",

This can help the aircraft take off with a shortened ground roll, as the aircraft generates more lift at a lower speed with flaps and slats extended. However, flaps and slats shorten the ground roll, but also decrease climb performance as they generate drag. Therefore, after takeoff these two devices are retracted. Flaps and slats both decrease stall speed, but flaps generate much more drag. The flaps are therefore retracted first and slats afterwards. Flaps increase CL for a specific angle of attack, giving a wing with flaps extended a higher CL and therefore higher lift than a wing without. Flaps also increase CLMAX and the CD for a wing, they decrease critical AoA. Slats do not necessarily increase CL for a specific AoA, but they increase the value for CLMAX, meaning that the aircraft stalls at a much higher AoA than normal. They also increase the drag a little on the wing where they are extended. Flaps increase lift, but this question states straight and level flight. If we want to remain in level flight, lift should not be increased because otherwise the aircraft will climb. Therefore the AoA will have to be decreased and the CL will remain the same, drag will increase and CLMAX will be increased. Note: Drag and Lift stay constant. At straight and level flight which means Lift=Weight (constant). IAS is said to have remained constant as well. Remember the lift and drag formula.",

Air comes in under constant pressure (which we will call X from this point onwards) and is directed through the tube. At a certain point in time, the tube starts becoming tighter. However, the same amount of air still has to travel through this (now tighter) tube (we call this airflow Y). It does so by flowing faster than before. This increased airspeed creates a lower pressure at the tighter part of the venturi, while the wider part still has its original pressure and airspeed. After the tightening, the tube becomes wider again and the air returns to its original static pressure and airspeed (airflow Z). It now has the properties of airflow X again. Before the venturi (airflow X) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal In the throat (airflow Y) Total pressure same as airflow X and Z Static Pressure low Speed of the airflow increased After the venturi (airflow Z) Static Pressure normal Speed of the airflow normal The venturi works on Bernoulli’s principle. Bernoulli’s principle states that in increase in speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the fluid’s static pressure.

If airspeed increases, the static pressure decreases and dynamic pressure increases, keeping total pressure the same.",

This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the presence of the nearby ground alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices and reduces the strength of downwash. Aircraft entering ground effect: Lift increases (if AoA remains constant) The effective angle of attack (αe) increases. The induced angle of attack (αi) decreases. Induced drag decreases. Downwash decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Lift decreases (if AoA remains constant). The effective angle of attack (αe) decreases. The induced angle of attack (αi) increases. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, the lift decreases when leaving ground effect, and this is more prominent on a low-wing aeroplane where the wings are naturally much closer to the ground.",

In this form, the options are quite vague and we could discuss which is correct for a long time and likely never reach an answer. Therefore, we have used our experience with the authorities to give our \"best guess\" of their correct answer. Obviously, the question could well be better worded in the real exam and with good knowledge of this subject, would likely be much easier to answer. Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, any differences you noticed from our version, and if you have any idea of the correct answer with your exam authority, thank you! Aircraft are fitted with high lift devices to reduce the take-off and landing distances and improve slow flying characteristics. There are both leading edge devices (LE flaps, kreuger flaps and slats) and trailing edge high lift devices (TE flaps of many kinds). Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly slower, and they do this by increasing the CLMAX of the wings, so that the lift will be enough to counteract weight, even at lower airspeeds. The greater the CLMAX becomes, the lower the stall speed. Secondary effects are increased drag and a change to the wing's chord line and angle of incidence, allowing the aircraft to fly with different pitch attitudes, which can be useful for pilot vision during landing. Let's go through the options now. \"Leading edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than trailing edge flaps because they enhance the wing’s curvature, increasing lift at lower speeds.\" This is not strictly true. Whilst leading edge flaps do enhance the wing's curvature, so do trailing edge flaps, and they both increase the maximum available lift at all speeds. \"Trailing edge flaps reduce stall speed more effectively than leading edge flaps by increasing the wing area and camber, enhancing lift.\" This is also very difficult to justify, as their increase in CLMAX depends on the TE/LE flaps used and to what degree. Also, not all flaps increase the wing area, only fowler flaps and some variations upon them. Again, TE and LE flaps both increase CLMAX. \"Both leading edge and trailing edge flaps have the same effect on reducing stall speed by equally increasing the wing's lift capabilities.\" For us, this seems most likely to be correct. They both reduce the stall speed by increasing the lifting capability of the wing, allowing the aircraft to fly slower before stalling. \"Equally\" is a bad word to use though, as they could definitely have a different amount of effect, but it is not for us to say if they do, or which is most \"useful\". \"Neither leading edge nor trailing edge flaps significantly reduce the stall speed; they primarily affect the aircraft's drag.\" Obviously incorrect, as they both do significantly reduce the stall speed.",

If we increase Angle of Attack, lift will be increased, also increasing the strength of wing tip vortices. Another factor increasing wing tip vortices is the aspect ratio (λ) of the wing. This is the ratio of the wing span to its mean chord. The aspect ratio of the wing is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing surface area. Therefore a short but wide wing has a low aspect ratio but a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio. With a lower aspect ratio, the induced drag is higher, thus increasing wing tip vortices. With a high aspect ratio, the induced drag is lower, reducing wing tip vortices. We can therefore state that the relationship between wing tip vortices and aspect ratio is inversely proportional.",

Since the climb angle is based on thrust and drag: Sin (γ) = (T – D) / W We know that we need to minimize drag as much as possible to get the best climb performance. Therefore lower flaps will be used. High flaps setting usually provide only a slight increase in lift whilst adding a large amount of drag. Approach and landing – The aircraft will be flying again at slow speeds, therefore to increase the safety margin we want a higher CLMAX and therefore a slower stall speed. Secondly, we are in a descent, therefore we can afford to have much more drag than during the departure. Therefore we use a large flap setting which will also create high levels of drag.",

Flaps also change the chord line of the wing, allowing a more nose-down attitude for better pilot visibility and easier landings. Flaps increase lift by increasing the camber of the wing, and often also increasing the wing area, depending on the style of flaps. This helps the aircraft gain more lift for the same airflow. An aircraft only needs enough lift to counteract its own weight in normal operations (and a little more in turns), so there is no need for more lift, only to fly slower, with the same amount of lift. The increased drag also comes from the increased camber and wing area, as this makes the wing less efficient, with a lower lift-to-drag ratio. The steeper the flap angle, the higher the drag they will produce, and this is parasite drag, which increases with the square of the speed. As the aircraft is maintaining the same flight path angle, the lift must remain the same, which removes the answer where lift increases.",

Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any gain of speed will result in an decrease in drag and further speed increase. The sudden change to a headwind (or a decrease in tailwind) can cause a gain of airspeed. Flying at a faster speed than VMD (front side), the aircraft will be in the stable speed region. Any increase of speed will result in an increase in drag. This increase in drag will cause the speed to decrease again (unless the thrust has changed).

Flaps also increase aircraft drag, which can be useful for energy management, particularly on large jets. Flaps increase the camber of the wing, and sometimes extend backwards to increase the wing are too. Increasing the camber leads to an increased coefficient of lift (CL), which allows a higher lift force to be produced from the same airflow. This means that an aircraft can fly slower without stalling, as the same amount of lift required to balance out the aircraft weight will be created at lower indicated air speeds. We do not use flaps all the time because they also greatly increase the coefficient of drag (CD), but this is not the answer to the question as increased drag is just a side effect, and does not allow us to fly slower without stalling.",

The vortices are strongest at the wing tips and become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The main factors affecting induced drag are wing planform, aspect ratio, speed, and weight/lift. The effect of planform is the principal factor affecting induced drag. The size of the wing tip vortex is directly related to the length of the wing tip chord. A rectangular planform wing produces a much larger vortex than the tapered section. This is because the longer the tip chord, the greater the spillage of air from the lower surface onto the upper surface, and the larger the wing tip vortex. In aerodynamic terms, the elliptical planform wing is the most aerodynamically efficient because the downwash remains constant across the complete wingspan, giving minimal induced drag.",

CLMAX AUGMENTATION One of the main factors which determine the CLMAX of an aerofoil section is the camber. Increasing the camber of an aerofoil section increases the CL at a given angle of attack and increases CLMAX. An increase in CLMAX will reduce the stall speed. LEADING EDGE SLAT A slat is a small auxiliary aerofoil attached to the leading edge of the wing. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed, the boundary layer is re-energized. The effect of the slat is to prolong the lift curve by delaying boundary layer separation until a higher angle of attack. The magnitude of the increase to CLMAX and the extent of the decrease to the stalling speed are directly proportional to the length of the leading edge of the aerofoil covered by the slat and the chord of the slat itself, i.e. the longer the slat the greater the CLMAX and the lower the stalling speed.",

Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

Stall speed: referring to the lift equation, and assuming all other factors stay the same, ice buildup decreases the CLMAX and increases the mass of the aircraft in flight. Firstly just by itself an increase in mass causes an increase in stall speed. Secondly, a smaller CLMAX means that a higher speed will have to be maintained in order to maintain the same lift. Therefore our stall speed will have increase due to ice accretion. Controllability: on top of the fact that an increase in weight will mean that any input in the control surfaces will lead to a slower reaction by the aircraft, icing can also get stuck between the control surfaces and or completely nullify their effect. For example, icing on the horizontal stabilizer will occur before the main wing, and seeing as the tail is normally producing a downwards force, a stall of the tail plane will lead to a drop of the nose of the aircraft and controllability over the longitudinal axis will have been completely lost. Therefore controllability will decrease in icing conditions.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

The arm is the distance of the CP from a specified position. As the CP moves with the changing angle of attack, the moment about a point will also change as the angle of attack changes. On a cambered aerofoil even though the centre of pressure (CP) moves with the changing angle of attack, the lift is assumed to act through the aerodynamic centre (AC). The combination of the AC and the pitching moment coefficient are required for the analysis of the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. The tailplane is a major contributor to the longitudinal stability of an aeroplane. To maintain a particular angle of attack a specific deflection of the elevator is established that will maintain this requirement. Thus, the movement of CP has an effect on both the pitching moment and stabilizer movement.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. It acts in the direction of the relative wind. Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

The vortices induce downwash to the airflow behind the wing, causing the lift vector to tilt rearward. The horizontal component of lift opposes the forward flight of the aircraft and is known as induced drag. The larger the vortex, the greater the induced downwash, and the greater the induced drag. The induced drag can be defined by: CDI= CL2 / π * AR Where, CDI– Induced Drag Coefficient CL2 – Lift Coefficient squared AR – Aspect Ratio Decreasing the speed of an aircraft maintaining straight and level flight will increase its angle of attack and therefore increase the CL. It is true that CL is inversely proportional to speed. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared.

The importance of maximum lift coefficient is that the greater the CLMAX, the lower the minimum flight speed (stall speed). If an aerofoil section of greater camber is used to give a lower minimum flight speed, the efficient cruise speed will be lower due to o the generation of excessive drag. It is better to use an aerofoil section that is efficient at high cruise speed, with the ability to temporarily increase the camber of the wing when it is necessary to fly slowly. In the figure is also dipected that the CL increases with increasing Angle of Attack until the point of CLMAX, where an increase in Angle of Attack leads to a decrease in CL. In this exercice there are two airfoils: - airfoil 1 and 2 are identical, with airfoil 2 at a higher angle of attack - airfoil 3 and 4 are identical, with airfoil 4 at a higher angle of attack Airfoil 1 and 2 have a higher thickness and camber when compared to airfoil 3 and 4. From this we can conclude that: - Airfoil 3 is producing the least CL as it has the least camber, thickness and angle of attack; - Airfoil 4 produces more CL than airfoil 3 because it has a higher angle of attack - Airfoil 1 prduces more CL than the previous ones due to its camber and thickness - Airfoil 2 produces the most CL because of its camber, thickness and higher angle of attack. Knowing this, we can select the correct option: 3, 4, 1, 2.",

Downwash can also be the change in airflow angle that wingtip vortices cause, but we don't think the question is referring directly to that. When flaps are extended, the aircraft can fly slower without stalling as the reduced airflow over the wing is being forced downwards at a steeper angle, which means the downwash angle increases, which means it still produces as much lift as the clean wing at higher speeds. This downwash can have a strong effect on the airflow hitting the horizontal stabiliser though, causing an increase pitch up moment on some aircraft, with the effect varying in strength, depending on where their wings and stabilisers are mounted.",

This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices.

            "explanation": "A plane can remain in the air by the wings generating lift. If this lift is equal to the weight (and the aircraft is in the air), the aircraft will remain in level flight. A wing operates through the principle of pressure differential and equal and opposite reactions. An aerofoil segment can generate lift by either having an angle of attack to the relative airflow, or but being cambered (bulging more in one direction), or both. Both these things mean that, to create lift upwards, the air flowing over the top of the wing must travel faster than the air underneath the wing, in order to provide a low pressure area above the wing due to the venturi effect. The way this occurs can be thought of through many different approaches, but it is easiest for our purposes just to say that the streamlines of air going over the wing get squashed together more than those under the wing (there is a little more to it, but we don't want to make it any more complex). The venturi effect creates a low pressure area above the wing, and the relatively higher pressure beneath the wing means that there is a net force upwards on the wing (from high to low), which is our lift. The air behind the wing is also given some downwash by this effect, and that satisfies the \"equal and opposite forces\" of Newton's 3rd law, in that the air going downwards forces the aircraft to go upwards. It is important to know that the low pressure air is the main contributor to the lifting effect, and not the \"high\" pressure beneath the wing, as that is only high relative to the low, not relative to ambient pressure.",

            "explanation": "Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings. When deployed, the slat forms a slot which allows passage of air from the high pressure region below the wing to the low pressure region above it. Additional Kinetic Energy is added to the airflow through the slot by the slat forming a convergent duct. When slats are deployed the boundary layer is re-energised. If Kinetic Energy is added to the boundary layer, boundary layer separation will be delayed to a much higher angle of attack. In terms of the pressure distribution of the aerofoil with a slat extended, the slat provides a fair amount of lift itself due to its shape, and when extended, it flattens the peak of the low pressure zone somewhat, allowing the low pressure zone to be more evenly distributed over the top of the aerofoil. It increases the suction overall as it allows a much higher critical AoA and higher CLMAX, as the adverse pressure gradient occurs more gradually, delaying the stall. Furthermore, the suction peak flattens, it does not move. This is why the CL location does not change very much when extending flaps. Note: We are aware that the wording of the correct option here is a little off regarding the suction peak, as the peak should reduce, but the overall suction increases. We think this could be what the examiner is trying to say. We still think it is the most correct option by far out of the available options, but please send us any further feedback if you see this question in the exam, thank you!",

This reduces the wing's stalling angle of attack and also its maximum coefficient of lift by up to 50%. Lift (CLMAX) The larger the angle of attack, the larger the decrease of CL with a maximum decrease at CLMAX Drag More skin friction drag results in overall more drag and earlier boundary layer separation. In significant icing condition, ice build-up can also increase the form or pressure drag Stall Speed Due to decrease of CLMAX and increase of the aircraft weight, stall speed will increase. Critical Angle of Attack Increased surface friction results in quicker flow separation. This reduces the critical angle of attack and a stall will occur sooner. Stability The decreased CLMAX of the tailplane could cause a stal when the aircraft is flying at low speed and with an increased downwash due to flap extension.

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps. The end of the wing reaches out and/or downwards, changing the side profile of the wing and moving the CP aft, resulting in a nose down pitching moment. This generates a higher value of CL at the same Angle of Attack. Therefore if flaps are being retracted, the Angle of Attack should be increased.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

Typical aspect ratios vary from 35 for a high-performance sailplane to as low as 3 for a jet fighter. The aspect ratio of a modern high-speed jet transport is about 12. Aspect Ratio is the measure of Span divided by Chord. As many wing planforms have variable chord lengths, there is a second formula which uses wing area instead, which effectively just makes use of the \"average chord\". AR = b/c or, AR = b2 /S Where: AR - Aspect Ratio b - Span c - Average Chord S - Wing Area Therefore, for this wing, the aspect ratio can be calculated in a few different ways. The easiest is to just to say that the average chord is 1.25 m, and span / chord = 12.5 / 1.25 = 10. Alternatively, you can calculate the wing area as two trapeziums (or any other way) as 2 x 6.25 x ((1 + 1.5) / 2) which gets you to 15.625 m2, and then do span2 / wing area, which is 12.52 / 15.625 = 10.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD (dashed line). We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. We can therefore imagine what each of the options would do to the graph, and measure that up with the annex in the question. \"Flaps\" Flaps increase our CLMAX and also increase drag, so the graph would move up and to the right, which is not the same as the annex. \"Landing Gear\" Landing Gear won't affect our lift, but they will increase drag, so the graph will move to the right only, not downwards like we see in the annex. \"Lift dumpers\" Lift dumpers such as wing spoilers reduce lift (as per their name) by ruining the airflow over the wing, and increase drag through this very same method, and by putting an obstruction in the airflow. They would cause the graph to go down and to the right, which matches up with the annex. \"Slats\" Slats allow an increase in the CLMAX as they allow for higher angles of attack to be flown, but they do not increase drag by very much, so the graph would move upwards, with perhaps a slight movement to the right near the top.",

To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m = ρ * A * V Continuity equation: m1 = m2 = m3 = ρ1 * A1 * V1 = ρ2 * A2 * V2 = ρ3 * A3 * V3 = constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q = 1 / 2 * ρ * V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

Ground effect is effective from the ground to approximately half the aircraft’s wingspan above ground. The effect is caused by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices, decreasing the downwash angle. Below the airfoil, a higher pressure than if an airfoil travels at higher altitude is created, as the air below the airfoil is trapped in between the wing and the ground.

Their main contribution is to increase the maximum lift coefficient, but not increase the lift coefficient at a certein AoA. The negative influence of extending slats is a slight increase in drag. Therefore we can say that at a certain AoA, slats will not increase lift, but they will increase drag slightly, therefore the only resultant moment will be a yaw. Flaps are aerodynamic surfaces that extended from the trailing edge of the wing. Their main purpose is to increase the camber of the wing to increase the coefficient of lift for a certain AoA. This can be seen on the figure. Their main contribution to the wing is extra lift. Whilst drag is also a side effect, lift it more significant.

We also require as much feedback from the real exam as possible to try and make this question more accurate, so please do let us know if you see this question, and anything you can remember from it, thank you. When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences around a 50% reduction of its induced drag. This phenomenon is called ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus upwash and downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash/Upwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: Downwash/Upwash increases. The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. (So the AoA increases to maintain lift) The induced angle of attack increases. Induced drag increases. In terms of the forces on the controls, it's a tricky one to answer. The forces will change on the elevators as elevators feel the reduced downwash behind the main wings when in ground effect, giving a pitch down moment, so a pitch-up moment is expected upon leaving the ground effect. However, this is not \"lighter\" or \"heavier\" controls. We believe that there is no consistent change, but please let us know if this is marked as incorrect in the exam and we can look into changing this. The learning objectives do not mention this, but they are also quite vague on this matter so do not remove it completely.",

Parasite drag increases with the square of the speed, induced drag changes with the inverse square of the speed (highest at low speeds). Together, they create the familiar drag curve of an aircraft. Sometimes, we have to convert that graph again, from drag (thrust required) to something more friendly to propeller aircraft. Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; the power required curve will look almost the same (There is a slight flat section of figure 2 but it is not important, imagine it looks the same as the others), but for each point on the curve, the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards).

As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

It takes every angle of attack of the wing, and plots the corresponding CL and CD values as a point on the graph. It is not as easy to read as a standard graph, but once you get used to that, it becomes quite simple. The CL is the lift coefficient and the CD is the drag coefficient. Using this, we can see that the point of highest lift coefficient is at the top of the graph, and has quite a high drag coefficient too. That must be CLMAX and is therefore the point just before the stall. Before that point is the best lift to drag ratio, where the CL is highest for the lowest CD. We can infer from this that the faster speeds are closer to the origin, and the speeds get slower as the graph continues. If we consider what happens when we extend trailing edge flaps, the CLMAX increases (allowing the aircraft to fly slower) and the drag increases, but by a larger proportion. The drag is also higher for each possible angle of attack. This means that the curve is shifted right and up, meaning that arrow 3 is correct. Although the lift is the larger force, the proportional increase in the drag is greater, and so the maximum lift/drag ratio decreases.",

Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The formation of ice and frost on the airframe will: - modify the profile of the aerofoil. - increase the roughness of the aircraft surface. - increase the weight of the aircraft. Ice will normally form on and around the leading edges of wings and tailplane and can result in severe distortion of the leading edge profile. This will give a large increase in drag and a substantial decrease in CLMAX. The skin friction drag will increase and the boundary layer will have an earlier separation, giving a reduced critical angle of attack, thereby a higher stall speed. Ice builds up on an aircraft when the super-cooled water droplets (SCWDs) hit the cold airframe and freeze onto the surface. This will happen most in particular sections of the aircraft, such as the leading edges of the wings, the nose, propeller spinners, the tail leading edges, and any protrusions such as the windshield, pitot tubes, AoA vanes, etc. These are obviously where the air is hitting the aircraft, and therefore some of the SCWDs will hit the airframe. This effect is much more pronounced when the items are sharp, instead of curved. Take a wing for example. When it is a very curved wing, useful for low speed flight, it will have a leading edge with a large radius, and the pressure waves that propagate from the front of the wing during flight are effectively giving the air advanced warning that the wing is coming, so it can move out of the way. This means that the SCWDs also move out of the way, so do not hit the wing as much. This means that sharp wings (with a smaller radius - used for higher speed flight) give less of a \"warning\" to the air, and the SCWDs will not move out of the way as much, thereby causing more ice accretion. This is the same for sharp protrusions such as the AoA vanes and pitot tubes.",

In the sense that increasing the angle of attack increases the wing's coefficient of lift in a mostly linear fashion, up until the critical angle of attack, when the wing stalls and any further increase in angle of attack causes a steep drop-off in lift coefficient. There is a graph to show this relationship, the CL vs Alpha (AoA) graph. The X-axis of the graph is the angle of attack (AoA) (α - Greek letter Alpha), and when the AoA is zero, a symmetrical aerofoil will not have any lift (well more precisely, it has both upwards and downwards lift of equal amounts which cancel out). However, a positively cambered aerofoil will produce some lift at zero degrees angle of attack, depending on how much camber is present. The Y-axis of the graph is the coefficient of lift (CL). This means that the graph for a symmetrical aerofoil will go straight through the origin, as 0º AoA = 0 lift, so CL = 0. A positively cambered aerofoil will have some lift at 0º AoA, so will have a line that crosses the Y axis above the origin. In this question, then, a symmetrical aerofoil's CL vs Alpha graph will cross the Y-axis and X-axis at the same point, so the question is asking about the origin of the graph, which means zero lift is being produced at that point.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure decreases. Statement 1 is therefore correct. With a decrease in section area (from station 1 to station 2), flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (streamlines converge). Statement 2 is therefore correct.",

The pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing creates a upwash around the tip of the wing that turns into a downwash behind the wing. This is known as a vortex, which creates a rearward force known as induced drag. This question is asking for the effect of: Speed: The induced drag is inversely proportional to the speed. Therefore, induced drag increases as the speed decreases, and, induced drag decreases and the speed increases. This is because, to maintain lift constant, as the velocity decreases, the coefficient of lift will have to be increased. At higher coefficients of lift, the pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing will be greater and therefore produce stronger vortices = stronger induced drag. (and vice versa) Changing mass: Induced drag is proportional to the mass. Therefore, induced drag increases with increasing aeroplane mass, and, induced drag decreases with decreasing aeroplane mass. This is because, as the aircraft get heavier, the lift that the wings will have to produce increases. To achieve that, the coefficient of lift will have to increase, meaning a higher AoA, which creates stronger vortices. (and vice versa) Summary: Higher AR = Lower induced drag Higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher weight = higher AoA = higher induced drag Higher speed = lower AoA = lower induced drag Winglets = lower induced drag.",

            "explanation": "Note: Beware of the difference between lift force distribution and coefficient of lift distribution. Questions like this one have never been asked about before to our knowledge, so read the following explanation to understand the difference. The planform of a wing is a fancy way of saying the shape of the wing when looked on from above. Wings can be made in many different planforms, which all have different properties, ranging from their spanwise lift distributions to their stall characteristics, transonic flight characteristics, ease of construction, etc. Spanwise lift distribution is exactly as it sounds. It refers to the lift produced by each point on the wing, running laterally from the root to the tip. The simplest wing, a rectangular wing, has a spanwise lift distribution that is mostly flat, but drops off near the tip. This is not the most efficient planform for creating lift, as the high lift near to the tip (before the drop off) causes strong vortices, which cause induced drag. An elliptical planform, however, is much more efficient when it comes to induced drag. An elliptical planform wing has much lower induced drag due to its shape, and the spanwise distribution of the lift force starts higher, and has a more gradual drop off towards the tip. This means that much smaller wingtip vortices are formed, as there is not much lift being created around the tip. (see bottom figure in annex Now an elliptical wing is sometimes said to have a \"flat\" lift distribution, but that is referring to the coefficient of lift. The coefficient of lift of an elliptical wing stays almost constant along the whole span of the wing (top figure in annex), but because the actual chord line of the wing becomes gradually shorter towards the tip, the lift force decreases (as per the lift equation, where chord length directly influences wing area [S]). There are a few more complex reasons why this is so good for reducing induced drag, but we are not going to go into them. We are frankly surprised that the examiner has gone this far into the technicalities of wing planforms, as they have previously used greater oversimplifications.",

Please let us know if you see this in the exam so we can verify it, as well as which authority you sat your exam under, thank you! The centre of pressure of a wing (aerofoil) is dictated by the pressure layout around the wing. This pressure layout changes dramatically depending on the shape, angle of attack, and speed of the relative airflow. The centre of pressure is kind of the \"average\" point of the pressure layout, where the sum of all the pressures acts through on the aerofoil. It is therefore the point through which the lift and drag act. It moves, depending on the angle of attack of a wing. For a positively cambered (normal) aerofoil in standard flight, the CP moves further towards the leading edge as the angle of attack increases, up until the stall. The aerodynamic centre is slightly more complex. When you add up all the forces on an aerofoil, there will be a resultant force through the centre of pressure, and this is split into lift and drag. The centre of pressure will not have any turning force around it, only forces acting directly through it. However, every other point on the wing will have a force acting around it, imagine holding the leading edge of an aerofoil in a wind tunnel, not only would it try and pull away from you, but it would also try to twist due to these moments. There is a point where the moments (turning forces around that point) stay the same, no matter the angle of attack (for the same IAS). This is called the aerodynamic centre, and it does not move (for a range of normal angles of attack and in the low subsonic speed regime). As you can see from the figure, the CP is behind the AC, and for normal ranges of flight, this will be the case.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE The strength and size of the vortices produced by an aeroplane are dependent on the amount of lift produced. Strong vortices are produced by large transport aeroplanes that create a significant amount of turbulence behind the aeroplane along the path of the aircraft. The disturbance so caused can extend for a considerable distance and last for several minutes. This is wake turbulence that can seriously affect the controllability of following aeroplanes if they are too close. The severity of the turbulence so created is categorised to enable following pilots to assess the difficulties that may be encountered. The larger, heavier aeroplanes create the worst turbulence that will cause problems to following pilots particularly when close to the ground during take-off or landing. Pilots are advised by the aviation authorities of the minimum distance and/or time separation from the aeroplane ahead deemed to be safe, to avoid having control problems. The minimum separation distance and/or time is based on the relative sizes of the aeroplanes concerned. Wake turbulence is affected by the height of the aeroplane and the prevailing wind conditions. The downwash of the airflow behind the aeroplane causes the vortices to descend to one thousand feet below the aeroplane. However, at low height, when the aeroplane is in ground effect, the vortices move outward from the path of the aeroplane over the ground. But any cross wind between 5 kt and 10 kt will prevent this happening to the upwind vortex and will keep it on the aircraft’s track. It is particularly important during the take-off phase that the following aircraft complies with the advised separation because of this. Aircraft mass, speed, aspect ratio and trailing-edge flap setting influence the strength of the vortices. The vortex strength is greatest for heavy aeroplanes at low airspeed and in the clean configuration, which is just after rotation at take-off. Vortices only cease when the nose-wheel touches down during landing ground run.",

            "explanation": "As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. The continuity equation is valid for steady-state flow, both in subsonic and supersonic flow. For subsonic flow, the air is incompressible (its density remains constant) thus, for subsonic flow: A1* V1 = A2* V2 = A3* V3 = constant. From figure 1, we can then conclude that sections with smaller area have an increase in speed. These areas are also where streamlines appear closer together. This can be used to make an analogy with an airfoil where streamlines are enclosed into a streamtube (figure 2). Therefore, we can conclude that: - Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. - Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed.",

The third dimensional flow is the movement of air laterally as it moves to the aft edge of the airfoil. This is called spanwise flow. As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow. Thus, the airflow over the two surfaces is moving in different directions when they meet at the trailing edge of the airfoil causing vortices to form along its entire length.",

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

INDUCED DRAG Whenever a wing produces lift, concentrated vortices form at the wing tips. The vortices are strongest at the wingtipsand become progressively weaker toward the centre-line of the aircraft. It is the production of lift itself which reduces the magnitude of the lift force being generated. To replace the lift lost by the increased downwash, the aircraft must be flown at a higher angle of attack. This increases drag. This extra drag is called induced drag. The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V²) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. INDUCED DRAG COEFFICIENT CDI = CL2 / π * AR Increasing the angle of attack increases CL. From the formula we can deduct that Induced drag is directly proportional to CL squared.

The stronger the vortices, the greater the induced drag. WING TIP VORTICES vs. FLAPS A stronger pressure differential above and below the wing generates stronger wing tip vortices. This may be achieved by flying at a higher angle of attack (flying a heavier airplane or flying slower). Vortex strength is greatest with aircraft in a “clean” configuration (for a given speed and weight). This is because, with flaps extended the outboard portion of extended flaps offer another opportunity for higher-pressure air below the wing to move up. With flaps extended, the aircraft generates four main vortices, weakening their overall effect. With the flaps retracted, those four vortices become two stronger ones.",

As caused by its movement through the air, is that for all positive angles of attack in level flight there is an excess area of low pressure above the upper surface of the airfoil. Thus, air will flow from the relatively high pressure under the lower surface around the wing tip to the lower pressure over the upper surface. Consequently, the flow of air moves outward from the wing root towards the wing tip on the lower surface and from the tip inwards towards the wing root on the upper surface. This is spanwise flow and is a slightly diagonal movement of the rearward airflow.

Assuming that they are the same wing with the addition of an aerodynamic device, that would fit the profile of a leading edge flap. Again, assuming that the same wing is being used, then line 3 has significant increase in CL for the same AoA, with a lower critical angle of attack, which would indicate the presence of trailing edge flaps. Another common line to see is that of slats, which follows the clean wing line, but continue on the same angle above the clean CLMAX, delaying the stall to a higher critical AoA. This is added here in green, and is very commonly asked. We do also need to spot that line 1 crosses through the origin. This means that at 0° AoA, the lift is zero, which means that the aerofoil is symmetrical. If the line crosses the Y-axis above the origin, then the aerofoil has positive camber. We can assume from the question text that the other lines represent different configurations of the same aerofoil, so our answer is symmetrical aerofoil with trailing edge flaps extended.",

In practice, they increase critical angle of attack as well. When the aircraft is at lower angles of attack (i.e. 5 degrees) the diagram shows that deployment of Trailing Edge (TE) flaps increases CL by much more than LE devices. This is because TE flap deployment increases local alpha, whereas LE devices reduce local alpha on the part of the wing where they are deployed. However, CL is still boosted a little, because LE devices increase camber and also increase the mass flow over the upper surface of the wing. This means that the airflow over the top of the wing has more kinetic energy, and the forward movement of the separation point at high alpha will be delayed. Therefore, we can increase AOA and CL beyond the point at which airflow over the wing without LE devices would have separated and we would stall. LE devices enable aircraft alpha to increase to a higher value before the stall, at which point CLMAX has a higher value than when TE flaps are deployed.",

Lift = 1/2 x ρ x V2 x CL x S Where; ρ = Air Density, V = Velocity (true air speed), CL = Coefficient of Lift, S = Wing Area. To use the formula above, we need everything in the correct units. That means that we have to convert the velocity (TAS) from knots into m/s. As 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour, we have to multiply by the amount of metres in a nautical mile (1852) and then divide by the amount of seconds in an hour (3600). Velocity = 73 kt x 1852/3600 = 37.55 m/s We are going to rearrange the formula to find the CL, and that means we need to have a value for the lift produced by the wing. As we are in straight and level flight, Lift = Weight, so we just need the weight of the aircraft. Weight = Mass x Acceleration due to gravity (G). Therefore; Lift = Weight = 7300 x 9.81 = 71613 N Referring to the rearranged equation in the annex above; CL = (2 x 71613) / (1.225 x (37.55)2 x 49) = 1.69",

The other part is to establish a relationship between induced drag and speed. From the graph attached to this explanation, we can conclude that an increase in speed leads to an decrease in induced drag. If you refer to the second attached figure, we can conclude how the Effective Airflow, Effective Angle of Attack, and Induced Drag behave: Wing tip vortices create certain vertical velocity components in the airflow in the vicinity of the wing, both in front of and behind it. These vertical velocities strengthen upwash and downwash, which reduce the effective angle of attack. The stronger the vortices, the greater the reduction in effective angle of attack. The effective angle of attack is the actual or effective angle of attack at the aerofoil. In level flight at a given mass the lift generated is the same at all forward speeds above the stalling speed. Because the angle of attack must decrease with increasing speed the same downwash speed has less effect at a high speed than it does at a low forward speed because it has a smaller downwash vector. Thus, the downwash angle is less at higher speeds than it is at lower forward speeds. Therefore, the induced drag is decreased at high speeds.",

The bottom of the graph, on the left, is where the angle of attack is low. In terms of level flight, this is where the aircraft must be flying fast in order to maintain the same lift force (equal to weight). Therefore, the top right of the graph is high angles of attack, including the stall. Therefore, going from A to B on the graph includes increasing the angle of attack (thereby increasing the coefficient of lift). This is what we do when we slow down, as with less airflow over the wings, we need each individual air particle to provide more lift in order to counteract weight. Therefore, the answer is that we must slow down to keep a constant lift, as if we did not slow down, the aircraft would have too much lift when we go from point A to point B and would start pulling upwards.",

            "explanation": "When an airplane flies at a height equal to or less than the length of its wingspan the efficiency of its wings is considerably improved. A low wing airplane, just before touchdown, experiences a 50% reduction of its total drag. This phenomenon is ground effect. Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tail plane. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. Aircraft entering ground effect: Downwash decreases. The effective angle of attack increases. Increased lift during landing if the angle of attack remains constant. The induced angle of attack decreases. Induced drag decreases. Aircraft leaving ground effect: The effective angle of attack decreases. Decreased lift during take-off if the angle of attack remains constant. Induced drag increases. Downwash increases. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The induced angle of attack increases. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.",

Parasite drag is further sub-divided into: Skin Friction Drag Form (Pressure) Drag, and Interference Drag NOTE: Skin Friction and Form Drag are together known as PROFILE DRAG. Form drag is produced whenever the streamline airflow passing over an aircraft separates from the surface and becomes turbulent. An example of extreme form drag is the effect of a flat plate placed at right angles to the airflow. The pressure immediately in front of the plate is above atmospheric, whilst the pressure behind the plate is below atmospheric. This results in a sucking effect behind the plate and the formation of vortices. The more rapidly the airflow changes direction, the greater the pressure gradient, the earlier the separation, and the higher the form drag. Changing the shape, or streamline, of a given object reduces drag by delaying the point at which the airflow separates.",

            "explanation": "The total drag is the resulting factor if you add induced drag and parasite drag together. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again. The CL/CD ratio is therefore biggest at VMD. Adding flaps or slats to this configuration will generate a large amount of drag, worsening the ratio. Therefore the highest value of the CL/CD ratio is obtained in clean configuration at VMD.",

This updraft turn into a downdraft behind the wing, creating a vortex. The higher the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the wing, the stronger the vortices. This question is specifically asking for: Angle of attack: The strength of the vortices (and therefore also induced drag) is proportional to the angle of attack. Therefore; the strength of the vortices increase as the angle of attack increases. And also; the strength of the vortices decrease as the angle of attack decreases. Therefore statement 1 is correct! Aspect ratio: The strength of the vortices is inversely proportional with the aspect ratio. Meaning that the strength of the wing tip vortices increase as the aspect ratio decreases. And vice versa: the strength decreases as the aspect ratio increases. Therefore statement 2 is correct!",

            "explanation": "Ground effect occurs because the surface alters the airflow pattern around the wings. Primarily, the surface restricts the formation of the wingtip vortices. This results in a reduction in the amount of induced downwash behind the wing and increases the wing’s effective angle of attack. It also alters the pressure distribution around the wing and the amount of lift developed. This occurs because the change in effective angle of attack increases the wing’s coefficient of lift (CL) and thus its lifting capability at any given angle of attack. The magnitude of the wing tip vortices, and thus downwash, also determine the amount of induced drag produced by the wing. The closer the aircraft is to the surface, the greater the reduction in induced drag at any given angle of attack. (figure 2) THE INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT ON LANDING When an aircraft enters ground effect during the landing phase of flight, the sudden increase in lift and reduction in drag cause it to experience a floating tendency. The aircraft also tends to pitch nose-down due to the reduction in download on the tailplane.",

Increases drag also over plain flaps. Used commonly on large jet aircraft for slow flight and landing (sometimes in conjunction with the fowler flaps below). Split flap - Increases drag heavily due to the open trailing edge. Very easy to manufacture. Fowler flap - Complex to design and fit, but increase lift by a large amount due to the increased wing area and camber. Increase in drag over plain flaps is smaller than the increased lift, so they provide a high L/D ratio, and are often used in conjunction with multiple levels of slotted flaps on larger aircraft.",
