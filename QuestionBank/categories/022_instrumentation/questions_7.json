In order for the FMS to make correct predictions, it is vital that the aircraft performance database contains correct data – calculations based on incorrect data will result in false computations and may be a threat to flight safety. Performance databases are based on the aircraft type, model, and engines fitted. This is why they do not go \"out of date\" like a navigation database does. The pilot must input the correct information from the load sheet and OFP (Operational Flight Plan) into the database before flight, which includes weights, centre of gravity positions, fuel quantities, and the performance degradation figure. The performance degradation figure is a value to allows the aircraft FMS (Flight Management System) to account for the increased drag and fuel burn of an older airframe. Note: Current feedback gives the \"up to date\" answer as correct. We believe that this should not be correct, and we think there may be some confusion possible between similar questions, some of which are talking about the navigation database rather than the performance database. We are therefore looking for any feedback (specifically about the wording of the question), so please put as much detail as you can remember in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much.",

A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning - automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength.

The navigation database cannot be modified; however, it has some additional storage space where the flight crew can create and store additional waypoints, routes, navaids, etc. they might need along their route. An example of an additional waypoint could be some Decision Points, which coordinates are indicated in the Operational Flight Plan the crew receives during the briefing. On a several sectors day, it is very common that the pilot stores the flight back (the second sector) on this additional storage of the navigation database. For instance, the FMS2 Honeywell Release 1A, allows the flight crew to create and store up to 99 waypoints, 10 runways, 20 navaids, and 5 routes. This will be different from one FMS to another, but it already gives you an idea of the capability of the additional storage space of the navigation database, called the supplemental navigation database. Caution! It is really important to understand and make the difference that pilots can use the Supplemental Navigation database to write and read information => by adding their own customized waypoint or other navigation data. BUT this is limited to ONLY this Supplemental Nav database! At the time of the Main Nav database update (every 28 days) the Supp Nav database is automatically erased. It makes sense as the Supp Nav database could include waypoints that have been defined using waypoints contained in the Main Nav database that may have changed as a result of the update.",

Each of these systems consists of a separate flight management computer (FMC) as its core piece, and its own input/output device, the CDU or MCDU. Both systems are usually interconnected in a way that allows pilot entries made in one system to be transferred to the other unit. If one unit fails, the other FMS unit can still operate in “independent mode”, which provides less precision. In this architecture (dual FMS), a malfunction of the cross-talk bus may occur, where both FMS units will continue fully operational, as they perform all computations based on separate data. However, automatic alerts in the event of deviations between both units can no longer be issued, meaning that pilots will have to verify correct functions themselves.

The FMS can automatically tune the navigation radios and determine lateral flight path courses. The FMS navigation database provides the necessary data to fly routes, SIDs, STARs, holding patterns, and procedure turns. Lateral offsets from the programmed route can be calculated and commanded. In most modern transport aircraft, two DME frequencies in DME/DME mode for calculating the radio position of the aircraft. The FMGC automatically tunes these as a function of their best accuracy. The flight crew does not receive any indication that this process is happening.",

The FMC provides the primary navigation, flight planning, and optimized terminal routes and en route guidance for the aircraft and is typically comprised of interrelated functions such as navigation, flight planning, trajectory prediction, performance computations, and guidance. The FMC and associated databases are an essential part of modern airline avionics. An FMC typically contains three databases in addition to the basic operational flight program (OFP). The first is a software options database which activates the optional functionality contained in the OFP that is desired by the operator. The second is the model and engine performance database and contains all the aircraft performance data which allows the FMC to compute fuel burn, optimum altitudes and airspeeds, etc. The third is the navigation database (NDB). The NDB contains all the information required for building a flight plan and processing that plan when airborne. All these databases are stored in the FMC on an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) card. Each of these databases can be updated via a data loader. The NDB contains terminal and en route fixes; waypoints and navigation reference system (NRS) grid points; intersections; airways and radio navigation aids. It also contains airports; runways; STAR and SID; holding patterns; and instrument approaches such as VOR, non-directional beacon, area navigation (RNAV), required navigation performance (RNP), satellite based navigation system (SBAS), and ground based navigation system (GBAS). Note: Additional space is provided between the NDB to save navigational data created by the pilot",

            "explanation": "Learning Objectives 022.11.02.01.05: Explain the threats and implications to the pilot of changing the database by error either on the ground or while flying. The Flight Management Computer (FMC) holds two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days to align with the standard revision cycle for navigation charts. Prior to flight, the flight crew can designate the active set, which the FMC employs for navigation computations. The maintenance department updates the contents of these navigation databases every 28 days. By the time the navigation chart revision date arrives, the new data is already integrated into the FMC and available for selection. Should pilots mistakenly switch navigation databases while on the ground or in-flight, it could compromise elements of the planned flight route, potentially leading to hazardous deviations in performance and navigation. In the best case, such an error may result in a flight plan discontinuity - this is typically flagged by multiple FMS warnings. However, there's also the possibility that the FMS can still adhere to the flight plan, albeit leading the aircraft along an unexpected path, causing both pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel to lose situational awareness. This scenario could potentially result in perilous close encounters between aircraft.",

MCDU INIT FUEL PRED PAGE The pilot uses this page to initialise the gross weight, center of gravity and block fuel, before starting the engines. The FMGC will stop using the pilot-entered block fuel and will compute its predictions based on the FOB indicated by the FQI computer after the first engine start. BLOCK: Crew may enter a block fuel for planning purposes. However, the FMS will take the fuel onboard from the fuel quantity indication system. After the aircraft is refuelled, the pilots should: - Check that the indicated Fuel On Board (FOB) corresponds to the Flight Plan - Check that if any imbalance is present, it is within the limits - compare the planned and actual uplift in mass (kgs or lbs). This will allow to identify any error or discrepancy that happened during the refuelling process. These discrepancies are generally limited by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and if out of limits a maintenance action is due.",

The FMS (Flight Management System) is the main computer that the pilots use to interface with the aircraft's more complex systems. Before a flight, the pilots will spend many minutes checking through the various pages in the FMS, making sure the data is correct, and inputting things such as the route, weights, clearances, temperatures, etc. The pilots can input many of these items from the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) which is part of the briefing pack the pilots have before the flight. Some of this data, however, such as updated weights and centre of gravity locations, arrive on the load sheet handed to the PIC by the dispatcher. The values on the load sheet then have to be checked/inputted into the FMS to make sure that the weights and CofG limits are correct for the flight. There are also databases in the FMS, and these are comprised of the navigation database and the performance database. These both need to be checked. The navigation database must be checked for time validity and the performance database must be checked to see if it contains the correct data, for example if it pertains to the correct aircraft variant with the correct engines. The alternate airport routing would not normally be entered into the FMS, unless it was expected to be used soon after take-off, which of course would be a scenario where taking off is not advisable in the first place. We do not input destination weather on most systems (and certainly not before take off).",

Both FMCs are synchronized, which means that each performs its own calculations then exchanges data with the other through a crosstalk bus. The master FMC sends its commands to the autopilot, the flight director system, and the autothrottle/collective. Independent mode – Both FMCs are decoupled and there’s ZERO cross-checking between them. This mode is automatically selected by the FMS under certain abnormal conditions such as different database validity on both FMCs. Single mode – When one FMC fails, the remaining one supplies both sides: its onside peripherals and failed FMC’s peripherals.

Each IRS computes a mixed IRS/GPS position called the GPIRS position. For this, each IRS can independently select their GPS source in order to maximize the availability of GPS data. If the GPIRS data does not comply with an integrity criterion that is based on a Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) and on the automatic detection of failed satellites, the FMS rejects the GPS mode and uses the radio position update. The flight crew can deselect/select the GPS position on the SELECTED NAVAIDS page, if necessary. Without GPS PRIMARY (GPS deselected or inoperative) the navigation accuracy is lower and is a function of ground radio navaid infrastructure or elapsed time since the last radio update. RNAV(GNSS) approaches may be performed, provided GPS PRIMARY is available and with AP or FD engaged. The flight crew may check the position computation using the POSITION MONITOR page.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

The simple GPWS cannot detect a rising pick and provide useful and timely alerts since its measurements are based on the RA.

            "explanation": "On a large transport airplane and according to the CS25, when the airspeed is becoming increasingly lower, the stall warning must begin at a speed exceeding the stall speed by not less than 5 kt or 5% CAS, whichever is greater. This is because the stall warning system needs to generate the alarm with sufficient margins in order to prevent inadvertent stalling with the flaps and landing gear in any normal position. The stall warning will typically consist of an aural warning with a voice warning such as ‘STALL, STALL’, and a stick shaker connected to the control column. Caution! The stall warning is only alerting the pilot that the aircraft has entered a stall while the stick pusher is a protection – it acts on the control column to prevent the aircraft from entering the stall conditions. Therefore, if no warning is heard upon recognition of the stalling conditions, it means that the stall warning is inoperative. However, if the stick pusher activated in timely and appropriate manner, it means that the stall PROTECTION system was working correctly.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it uses the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS II can display up to 30 traffic simultaneously. This means that the system can handle a significant number of traffic alerts and resolution advisories at the same time, providing crucial information to the flight crew for collision avoidance. The display of these advisories is essential for the safe operation of the aircraft, especially in busy airspace where multiple aircraft may be in close proximity.",

The stall warning must continue until the angle of attack is reduced to approximately that at which the stall warning is initiated.

Therefore, besides the autopilot (for obvious reasons) it is the primary source of information during an automatic landing. The transition from one phase to another during the autoland is based on the height measured by the radio altimeter. For example, at 50 ft AGL the glideslope signal is disconnected, and between 50 ft AGL and touch down, the autopilot will keep a vertical speed depending on the radio altimeter height, as this is more precise than the barometric altitude.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

The GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. However, this limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Given the location of the aircraft, its course and height (either from the ADC or derived from GPS) a display can be created showing the locations of terrain that could threaten the safety of the aircraft. Note: It is important to note that the EGPWS has the basic functions of the GPWS to which the 'look ahead' function is added. This means that the EGPWS also relies on the Radar Altimeter as one of its inputs.

Resolution Advisory – red full square. A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic Advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay.

The radio altimeter has two other important functions: - It supplies the automatic flight system with data to affect automatic landings when used in association with the ILS / MLS. - It furnishes height information and rate of change of height to the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), and is a crucial component of this system. The instrument makes use of primary radio principles transmitting a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) in an elliptical pattern vertically below the aircraft. GPWS The aim of the system is to give visual and audible warning signals to a pilot when the aircraft’s proximity to the terrain poses a potential threat to its safety. GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 2) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). In this exercise: Although the GPWS generated a 'TOO LOW TERRAIN', the visual references confirm that the altitude indication (FL80) and terrain clearance coincide with the expected and not with the GPWS caution. This means that this warning is either spurious or results from a system malfunction.",

Two independent digital computers are normally installed which compute the proper stall warning based on the angle of attack, flap configuration, and thrust. The computers receive inputs from the: - angle of attack sensor (Alpha probe) - flap position transmitter - N1 and N2 indicators - air/ground relay - air data computers - leading edge module. At a pre-set angle of attack, the circuit completes and an eccentric weight motor attached to the base of either or both control columns operates. The motor in turn vibrates the control column, thus imitating the effect of aerodynamic buffet, and alerts the flight crew before a stall develops. This also displays visually on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). In the event the angle of attack becomes frozen at a specific Angle of Attack, an increase in AoA will not be detected by the computer and a stall warning will then not be triggered.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

If the radio altimeter were to provide intermittent or unreliable height information, the autothrottle system may become confused or unable to maintain a stable flight profile. In the event of the FMA displaying \"RETARD\" during cruise flight, the pilot should immediately take action to manually adjust the engine thrust to maintain a safe and stable flight. The pilot should also follow the appropriate procedures to troubleshoot and correct the issue with the autothrottle system or its inputs, which may involve switching to an alternate system or using manual control of the engines for the remainder of the flight.",

Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this question in the comments, as we require some more information to work out what EASA actually wants from us here, Thank you! On most modern transport aeroplanes the stall-warning device activates primarily via an angle of attack or Alpha sensor. One of these sensors is located on either side of the fuselage near the nose, and detects the change/rate of change of angle of attack of the aeroplane as the airspeed varies. Two independent digital computers are normally installed which compute the proper stall warning based on the angle of attack, flap configuration, and thrust. The computers receive inputs from: - the angle of attack sensor (Alpha probe) - the flap/slat position transmitter - the N1 and N2 indicators - the air/ground sensor - the air data computer (including CAS) When the system receives the correct signals to indicate being close enough to a stall to initiate the warning, an eccentric weight motor attached to the base of either or both control columns operates. The motor in turn vibrates the control column, thus imitating the effect of aerodynamic buffet, and alerts the flight crew before a stall develops. This also displays visually on the Primary Flight Display (PFD).",

Through sophisticated look-ahead algorithms, both caution and warning alerts are generated if terrain or an obstacle conflict with “ribbons” projected forward of the aircraft. These ribbons project down, forward, then up from the aircraft with a width starting at 1/4 nm and extending out at ±3° laterally, more if turning. The look-down and up angles are a function of the aircraft flight path angle, and the look-down distance a function of the aircraft’s altitude with respect to the nearest or destination runway. This relationship prevents undesired alerts when taking off or landing. The look-ahead distance is a function of the aircraft’s speed, and distance to the nearest runway. A terrain conflict intruding into the caution ribbon activates EGPWS caution lights and the aural message “CAUTION TERRAIN, CAUTION TERRAIN” or “TERRAIN AHEAD, TERRAIN AHEAD”. An obstacle conflict provides a “CAUTION OBSTACLE, CAUTION OBSTACLE” or “OBSTACLE AHEAD, OBSTACLE AHEAD” message. The caution alert is given typically 60 seconds ahead of the terrain/obstacle conflict and is repeated every seven seconds as long as the conflict remains within the caution area. When the warning ribbon is intruded (typically 30 seconds prior to the terrain/obstacle conflict), EGPWS warning lights activate and the aural message “TERRAIN, TERRAIN, PULL UP” or “OBSTACLE, OBSTACLE, PULL UP” is enunciated with “PULL UP” repeating continuously while the conflict is within the warning area.",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. RA is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of this system despite possible conflicting ATC instructions. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, nonetheless pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology.",

All of the remaining options would be green. Please let us know if you come across this question. At the moment from feedback and commonly used EGPWS systems, we think the best option is \"below the aircraft altitude by less than the required obstacle clearance.\", as the aircraft being only 500 ft above terrain is not acceptable terrain clearance, and any yellow regions are either that bad (aircraft 500 ft above terrain) or worse (aircraft as low as 2000 ft below terrain) for terrain clearance. When the airplane is 500 feet or more above the highest terrain in the selected display range, terrain is depicted in green, and colour density varies based on terrain elevation: Solid green: Highest elevation terrain High-density dotted green: Intermediate elevation terrain Low-density dotted green: Lowest elevation terrain Black: No significant terrain When the airplane is less than 500 feet above the highest terrain in the selected display range, colour and density vary based on terrain elevation vs. airplane altitude: Solid red: Look-ahead terrain warning active Solid amber: Look-ahead terrain caution active Dotted red: Terrain more than 2000 feet above the airplane's current altitude Dotted amber: Terrain 500 feet (250 feet with gear down) below to 2000 feet above the airplane's current altitude.

            "explanation": "A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic Advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated in an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The Resolution Advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 1) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts. These conditions are described as MODES: - MODE 1 - Excessive Barometric Descent Rate - MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate - MODE 3 - Altitude Loss after Take-off or Go-around - MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear Not down - MODE 4B - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Flaps Not in Landing Configuration - MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert This mode alerts the flight crew of a descent of more than 1.3 dots below an ILS glide slope. AURAL ALERT - “GLIDE SLOPE” The mode may be cancelled or inhibited by pressing 'G/S MODE' pb on the overhead panel. (figure 2) - MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude - MODE 6B Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert - MODE 7 Windshear Alerting",

It's important to note that the \"TOO LOW GEAR\" (MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear not Down) alert takes precedence over the \"TOO LOW FLAPS\" alert. However, both alerts can be inhibited if the flap inhibit switch is placed in the FLAP OVRD (override) position.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the Resolution Advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The Resolution Advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic Advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution Advisory – red full square.",

            "explanation": "A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. When a threat is detected, RA instructions will be announced on the appropriate TCAS II display in each of the involved aircraft. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

It acheives this by transmitting radio waves vertically downwards from an aerial on the underside of the fuselage which are then reflected back from the ground and received via a separate aerial. The height of the aircraft is proprotional to the time taken for the radio waves to be received after being transmitted. In most Commercial Air Transport (CAT) aircraft the radio altimeter is operational up to 2500 ft above ground level (AGL) The radio altitude display will disappear from the PFD when above 2500 ft. As well as displaying height to the pilots the output from the radio altimeter is used by other systems including TCAS, GPWS/TAWS and the Autopilot. Autopilots need very accurate height information to perform an automatic landing as the flare manoeuvre is based on the height of the lowest wheels of the landing gear above the runway. For this reason a radio altimeter has to be calibrated so that it reads 0 ft when, in the landing configuration, the wheels touch the runway. The height between the fuselage aerials and the lowest wheel of the landing gear, in the landing configuration, is known as the Residual Height and will be different for each aircraft type. Note: The ‘landing configuration’ is with the landing gear oleos fully extended and the aircraft in a nose high approach attitude. After landing with the oleos compressed and the fuselage level the residual distance will be less so the radio altimeter may indicate a small minus figure.",

Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) (figure 1) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts. These conditions are described as MODES: - MODE 1 - Excessive Barometric Descent Rate - MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate - MODE 3 - Altitude Loss after Take-off or Go-around - MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear Not down - MODE 4B - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Flaps Not in Landing Configuration - MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert - MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude - MODE 6B Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert - MODE 7 Windshear Alerting",

The vertical distance of the lowest structure on the airframe, which is the extended main gear, from the ground surface is measured by a device called a radio altimeter. Indications given by this device are therefore equal to the aircraft’s true height. Its indication ranges from 0 to 2500 ft and besides visually providing the actual radio altitude, the system also issues aural alerts when passing certain radio heights. In addition to direct display, the radio altitude information is also sent to other systems, such as: flight director and autopilot systems (including Autoland and auto thrust), the GPWS, as well as the airborne or traffic collision avoidance system (ACAS/TCAS). With regards to this question: The GPWS system is active at all heights at which the low range radio altimeter can function, i.e. between ground and 2500 ft AGL. A dangerous situation that could be caused by a false radio height is a mode change in the automatic thrust control. If a radio altimeter erraneously reports a radio height of 50 ft or below while the autothrust system is engages in approach mode, it will trigger the flare or retard step of the autoland sequence and reduce thrust to zero for the flare.",

The system generates a windshear warning whenever the predicted energy level for the aircraft falls below a predetermined threshold. This energy level as an angle of attack and is compared with an angle-of-attack threshold above which windshear conditions are most likely to occur and requiring pilot action. The aural warning consists of a two-tone siren, which is followed by an aural warning of “WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR”. A visual warning message is also displayed on each Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI), and remains there until the windshear condition subsides.

The ACAS equipment may generate a TA up to 20 seconds in advance of an RA. Warning times depend on sensitivity levels of RAs. Therefore, ACAS generates a TA approximately 35 to 55 seconds before the closest point of approach (CPA) of the aircraft. 3.18.2.7 - Aural annunciations When a TA is initially issued, the aural annunciation “TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC” is spoken once.

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation. Terrain Awareness System (TAWS) GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. This limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Seven main conditions give rise to audible and visual alerts. These conditions are described as MODES: - MODE 1 - Excessive Barometric Descent Rate - MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate - MODE 3 - Altitude Loss after Take-off or Go-around - MODE 4A - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Landing Gear Not down This mode activates whenever the terrain clearance reduces to 500 ft radio altitude, regardless of the barometric rate, UNLESS the landing gear is fully extended. AURAL ALERT -”TOO LOW GEAR” or “TOO LOW TERRAIN” - MODE 4B - Unsafe Terrain Clearance with Flaps Not in Landing Configuration This mode provides an alert when the gear is down and the flaps are not in the landing position. The standard upper boundary for this sub mode is 245 ft radio altitude. AURAL ALERT - ”TOO LOW FLAPS” or “TOO LOW TERRAIN” - MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert- MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude - MODE 6B Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert - MODE 7 Windshear Alerting",

INFORMATION DISPLAY The action required to comply with the Resolution Advisory displays on a specialised Resolution Advisory/Vertical Speed Indicator (RA /VSI) instrument using a colour liquid crystal screen, which shows the rate of climb, and intruder information. On other aeroplanes, the intruder information displays on the EFIS Navigation Display screen. In either case, the symbology used is the same: Hollow White or blue diamond - Other traffic not offering a threat. Solid White of blue diamond - Traffic within 6 nm and 1200 ft vertically. Solid Yellow Circle - Traffic advisory. Solid Red Square - Resolution advisory. Each symbol has a data tag attached to it, which appears in the same colour as the associated symbols. This data provides the altitude of the target in reference to your own aeroplane’s altitude (e.g. + 06 indicates 600 ft above). An arrow also indicates whether the ‘target’ is climbing or descending. There is also often provision to display momentarily absolute pressure altitude in hundreds of feet of pressure altitude. Where the target is a mode A transponder with no height transmissions, no data tag appears and no RA is given. If the target does not have a functioning transponder, the TCAS system is unable to detect its presence.",

It also has the abilities to prioritize warnings as follows: Advisory message – crew awareness IS required, and subsequent crew action MAY be required. They may be of any colour except red and preferably not amber. Caution message – crew awareness IS required, and subsequent crew action WILL be required. They are the next highest priority alert messages after warning messages, and they are usually amber. Warning message – immediate recognition and corrective or compensatory action by the crew IS required. They are the highest priority alert messages and always of red colour on the displays. Warning messages are triggered for situations such as the VMO/MMO exceedance or stall warning. Aural alerts are used to attract attention via a different sensory input. All warnings and most cautions are provided with aural alerts (fire bell, autopilot/autothrottle disconnect wail, stall warner, GPWS, etc.). They serve a different purpose to visual indications, and can be used alongside for increased attention. Haptic and tactile alerts (such as the stick shaker) can also be used to alert the pilot further, and can allow the pilot to make sense of the inputs faster and perform associated procedures better. Note: The only possible answer here includes aural alerts, but for a caution, this is not always strictly the case, such as the B737 master caution (which has no aural alert), but the question is arguably still correct, as this light indication alone might not cause the pilot to look up at all from their paperwork (the master caution light is difficult to miss with normal head positioning whilst looking forwards.).

            "explanation": "The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square. A TCAS II provides the intruder relative position (Traffic advisory and proximate traffic) and possibly an indication of a collision avoidance maneuver (Resolution Advisory) within the vertical plane only, by comparing the mode C pressure altitudes of the aircraft. The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay.",

The vertical distance of the lowest structure on the airframe, which is the extended main gear, from the ground surface is measured by a device called a radio altimeter. Indications given by this device are therefore equal to the aircraft’s true height. Its indication ranges from 0 to 2500 ft and besides visually providing the actual radio altitude, the system also issues aural alerts when passing certain radio heights. In addition to direct display, the radio altitude information is also sent to other systems, such as: flight director and autopilot systems (including Autoland and auto thrust), the GPWS, as well as the airborne or traffic collision avoidance system (ACAS/TCAS). With regards to this question: The GPWS system is active at all heights at which the low range radio altimeter can function, i.e. between ground and 2500 ft AGL. A dangerous situation that could be caused by a false radio height is a mode change in the automatic thrust control. If a radio altimeter erraneously reports a radio height of 50 ft or below while the autothrust system is engages in approach mode, it will trigger the flare or retard step of the autoland sequence and reduce thrust to zero for the flare. We believe that the option \"TCAS\" should not be within the available options as an isolated item - it should be included in the correct option as it is also affected by a radio altimeter malfunction/failure.",

It interrogates operating transponders in other airplanes, tracks the other airplanes by analyzing the transponder replies, and predicts the flight paths and positions. This system provides advisory and traffic displays of the other airplanes to the flight crew. Neither advisory, guidance, nor traffic display is provided for other airplanes which do not have operating transponders. TCAS equipment interrogates the transponders of other airplanes to determine their range, bearing, and altitude. A traffic advisory (TA) is generated when the other airplane is approximately 40 seconds from the point of closest approach. If the other airplane continues to close, a resolution advisory (RA) is generated when the other airplane is approximately 25 seconds from the point of closest approach. The RA provides aural warning and guidance as well as maneuver guidance to maintain or increase separation from the traffic. If altitude data from the traffic aircraft’s transponder is not available, no RA can be provided. The TCAS also has feeds from the radio altimeter to modify the RAs received when in close proximity to the ground. There are no instructions given at all when the aircraft is below 400 ft AGL, no descent RAs are given below 1000 ft AGL and no increase rate of descent commands below 1450 ft AGL. Below 1,000 feet when the TA/RA mode is selected on the transponder panel, TA only mode is enabled automatically and the TCAS message TA ONLY displays on the ND. The system will also take aircraft configuration/performance into consideration when deciding an avoiding action. When the aircraft has gear and/or flap deployed its climb performance will be poor so TCAS will avoid giving climbing demands for an RA.",

The instrument determines the bearing of an intruder by using two specific antennas. The TCAS II can only operate normally with a fully operational transponder since it is using the replies from the transponders of other aircraft. Therefore, if other aircraft do not have a serviceable transponder no protection will be provided against them. In the same way, if any of the concerned aircraft does not have the altitude reporting capability from the mode C transponder, the TCAS II will only issue Traffic Advisories (TA). The TCAS computer uses the aircraft’s configuration data (gear/flaps), pressure altitude from the mode C transponder, and the radio altimeter’s height. The TCAS II has inputs from the radio altimeter in order to gradually inhibit the resolution advisories (RAs) when getting closer to the ground such as during the approach phase. The instrument itself can have a specifically dedicated screen situated on the cockpit’s instruments panel or it can be a variometer on a liquid crystal screen displaying the TAs and RAs. The TCAS II can also be integrated into an EFIS screen or be combined with the weather radar. The resolution advisories issued by the TCAS are either preventive or corrective: Preventive – advise the flight crew to monitor the vertical speed. Corrective – the vertical speed must be corrected without delay. The color and symbols code of the TCAS II is the following: Proximate traffic – white or cyan solid lozenge. Traffic advisory – amber solid circle. Resolution advisory – red full square.",

TCAS II uses a Mode S transponder, the same transponder that's interrogated by air traffic control (ATC) to provide the aircrafts altitude, identity and other flight information. The normal operational range of TCAS II is 14 nm and it can detect up to 30 aircraft. In high density traffic areas the ATC transponder functions need to be protected. This is achieved by limiting the amount of time the transponder spends on TCAS functions to approximately 2%. When multiple intruder aircraft are detected TCAS II enters a 'reduced surveillance' mode by extending the interrogation rate from 1 second to 5 seconds and reducing the range to 5nm to prioritise the nearest threats.",

If you do see a question about only GPWS, please go to question 222062 and let us know in the comments, we want to check if it is being asked alongside this one, thanks! GPWS The aim of the GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System) is to give visual and audible warning signals to a pilot when the aircraft’s proximity to the terrain poses a potential threat to its safety. GPWS enhances flight safety and can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ Radio Altitude and automatically selects the correct mode of operation, using the radio altimeter and other inputs to automatically select the correct mode of operation, delivering one of many different aural alerts (made up of aural cautions [yellow], and aural warnings [red], depending on the mode and distance from terrain/impact) to the flight crew, such as \"SINK RATE\" when the rate of descent is too high, or \"GLIDESLOPE\", when the aircraft deviates too far below the glideslope. EGPWS is called enhanced GPWS, and is the much more modern version of the older GPWS system. It uses a terrain database to \"look ahead\" at the aircraft's flight path and call out if it is on track to hit terrain. This is something that the older GPWS system could only guess at, as it could only measure the distance from terrain directly below the aircraft. This means that as well as the standard GPWS alerts and warnings, EGPWS can give the pilots a view of the nearby terrain on their navigation display (ND) to aid situational awareness and their subsequent terrain escape manoeuvre.",

In such a system, the radio obtains an accurate vertical measurement of the distance from the aircraft to the Earth’s surface immediately below it. The GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. However, this limitation has been overcome by Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system (be that INS/GPS or any combination). Given the location of the aircraft, its course and height (either from the ADC or derived from GPS) a display can be created showing the locations of terrain that could threaten the safety of the aircraft. Note: It is important to note that the EGPWS has the basic functions of the GPWS to which the 'look ahead' function is added. This means that the EGPWS also relies on the Radio Altimeter as one of its inputs. GPWS = Ground Proximity Warning System TAWS = Terrain Awareness Warning System HTAWS = Helicopter Terrain Awareness Warning System",

The second statement refers to the Stall Warning device usually found on small aircraft. Light aircraft normally have an audible stall-warning device that operates just before the stall. This device is activated by a moving vane (Flapper Switch), positioned approximately midway along the wing, just below the leading edge as seen in figure 2. Airflow holds down the vane at normal operating angles of attack, but just before the wing stalls, movement of the stagnation point around the leading edge lifts the vane (figure 3). This closes a micro-switch and sounds a buzzer in the cockpit, giving warning of an impending stall.",

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please note that this question was generated based on limited feedback, and we have incomplete information about the available options. We have included this question in our database in the hopes that someone might recognize it and provide additional details. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you! Pilots should use caution and critical thinking when relying on an on-screen checklist for dealing with malfunctions. Although the checklist provides valuable guidance, pilots should remember that the actions displayed were programmed in advance and may not fully adapt to the specific situation. Computers can only monitor predefined parameters and trigger programmed responses, whereas human pilots can use knowledge-based behavior to respond dynamically. To ensure the effective use of automated on-screen checklists while mitigating their limitations, it is recommended to follow a specific procedure. Firstly, it is crucial to verify the reported failure by consulting another member of the flight crew and assessing both supporting and contradictory data. This step is essential to prevent inappropriate reactions caused by a misinterpretation of the malfunction by the system. Once the reported malfunction has been confirmed, the on-screen checklist should be followed meticulously and deliberately. Each selection should be made with careful consideration of its implications. When dealing with highly critical actions like operating thrust levers or guarded switches, extra caution must be exercised, and explicit confirmation from the other crew member should always be sought. \"CONFIRM\" Step The word \"confirm\" is added to the checklist items when both flight crew members must verbally agree before action is taken. During an inflight non-normal situation, verbal confirmation is required for: An engine thrust lever And engine start lever An engine, APU or cargo fire switch A generator drive disconnect switch An IRS mode selector, when only one IRS is failed A flight control switch",

Although a PFD displays altitude, the actual calculation of altitude and other air data is carried out by an Air Data Computer (ADC). Altitude calculation is based on the measurement of atmospheric static pressure which reduces with altitude. In a conventional mechanical altimeter static pressure is fed to the instrument via a line from the static port. An aneroid capsule inside the instrument, connected to the display pointers, expands and contracts with changes in static pressure. An Air Data Computer needs a static pressure input to be able to calculate altitude but this needs to be a digital input. Thius is acheived by using an Air Data Module (ADM) which contains solid state pressure tranducers which convert the pressure from the static port into a digital signal that the ADC can use. The ADC then feeds that information to the PFD and any other systems that require it.",

Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode?

Modern aircraft have electronic systems that can detect and diagnose failures, displaying an electronic checklist for pilots to follow. The checklists provide guidance and help prioritise actions. For example, when an engine fails, it is an instance where pilots may be presented with an electronic checklist. Restarting a damaged engine is generally not advisable. Attempting to restart a damaged engine can result in further damage or a catastrophic malfunction, posing a significant safety risk to both the passengers and the aircraft. Despite the electronic checklist suggestion, it is advisable for pilots to use their discretion and refrain from taking action if there are any indications of damage or other issues.",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it can only be figure 1 or 6 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for an ILS mode, where the frequency of the ILS is indicated at the bottom of the display. Figure 1 indicates ‘VOR’ and figure 6 indicates ‘ILS’ with its associated frequency on the right of the ND. Therefore, the correct ND is represented in figure 6.",

The EVS includes external sensors like infrared cameras to generate real-time images on the PFD or on the HUD. The limitation of the EVS is that infrared cameras use temperature and temperature differences to produce images. This means that high outside temperatures with a large difference in the temperatures of outside objects will produce images of high resolution. Lower outside temperatures with little variation between the temperatures of outside objects will produce images of a poorer resolution. The EVS allows for low visibility operations such as take-offs and landings to be conducted with lower minimum visual requirements. This is because the increased resolution of real-time images enhance the visibility of experienced pilots. Note: This is fundamentally quite different from a SVS (Synthetic Vision System), as asked in a very similar looking question, No. 224897.

An electronic centralised aircraft monitoring system (ECAM) can only react to triggers from aircraft sensors when deciding which checklist to display to the pilots. In this case the system detects a fuel ‘out of balance’ condition so displays the appropriate checklist which will include actions to try to correct the imbalance. Whenever there is an unexpected fuel quantity indication pilots must always consider the possibility of a fuel leak. Selecting 'FUEL X FEED - ON' when there is a fuel leak could result in pumping the remaining fuel overboard through the leak! There is no caution or warning for a fuel leak, pilots must check the total fuel used against the fuel remaining to ascertain whether there is a leak before deciding to open the fuel x -feed.",

Full Rose displays show a full HSI on screen so data can be presented in all directions from the aircraft, such as bearing pointers and CDIs for VORs and ILSs, etc. Expanded displays show just the area ahead of the aircraft (and about 45° either side of the heading) with often less clutter and a more useful view of forward waypoints, etc, useful in the cruise. The 3 modes which have both functions are MAP (showing the planned route ahead, waypoints, beacons, etc.), VOR (giving standard VOR HSI information) and APP (which gives a wider view of the localiser and glide path pointers). On some systems, the VOR/APP (VOR/ILS) mode is combined, and the difference is decided on what frequency is selected, whether that is an ILS or VOR frequency The \"PLAN\" mode is the odd one out, and shows a North Up view of the planned route. Figure 1 shows a Full Rose VOR display, as is has a HSI showing with VOR in the bottom left, and no vertical information. Figure 2 is a PLAN mode display, showing a North Up view of the route. Figure 3 is an Expanded MAP mode display, as the route ahead is shown, with LNAV and VNAV indicators showing. Figure 4 is an Expanded VOR display, as there is a \"VOR\" in the bottom left, and there is no glide path indicator on the right. Figure 5 shows an expanded approach (APP) mode display, as there is an \"ILS\" in the bottom left corner, and both the localiser and glide path indicators are showing, with not much else on the main display. Figure 6 is a Full Rose APP mode display, as it also shows \"ILS\" in the bottom left and a glide path indicator on the right hand side.",

However, it is essential to be aware that various manufacturers might use different terms for the same modes. To answer this question, one can simply eliminate options containing \"WX\" (weather), \"TERR\" (terrain), and \"WYP\" (waypoint) since these are overlays and not selected using the rotary mode-selector knob. If anyone encounters this question, kindly inform us. Thank you! The EFIS control panel comprises a diverse array of rotary, toggle, and pushbutton switches. On the left side of the panel (as illustrated in the accompanying figure), there is a rotary mode-selector knob that allows you to choose from four primary display modes: • VOR • ILS (or APP) • MAP (or ARC) • PLAN Among these modes, the VOR and ILS modes can be exhibited with either a full or expanded compass display. Additionally, the EFIS system offers various \"overlays\" that can be selected to superimpose over the primary data of the ND (Navigation Display). These overlays may include information such as WX radar data, TCAS-detected aircraft in the vicinity of your aircraft, or terrain information provided by the GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System). Pilots have the flexibility to pick which overlays they want to display, although some overlays cannot be used in conjunction with others. For instance, the pilot can typically choose either the WX radar data or GPWS terrain, but not both simultaneously. Overlays can be shown on both MAP modes (Map and Center Map) or on the Expanded VOR (NAV) or Expanded APP modes. However, overlays cannot be displayed on the FULL VOR or FULL APP modes or on the PLAN mode.",

An electronic centralised aircraft monitoring system (ECAM) can only react to triggers from aircraft sensors to decide which checklist to display to the pilots. In this case the system detects the engine failure but is not necessarily aware of physical damage to control circuits. In the absence of a fire warning or vibration the checklist may well suggest an engine relight attempt. Hopefully the pilots will have been alerted by passengers and cabin crew to the loss of the engine cowling so will be considering the possiblity of engine damage. Armed with this information it would be unwise of the pilots to attempt a relight when the extent of the engine damage is unknown.",

Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, 3 of the provided figures of ND are expanded modes, and only figure 1 is a 360° compass rose VOR mode. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. The above point allows you to select the correct answer. However, just as a crosscheck you can look for other indications that would confirm you Figure 1 is the correct answer. As you can see, it has the VOR indication at the bottom left-hand corner and its frequency on the right (114.75). A course deviation scale is also displayed and further confirms that the given ND is a VOR mode display with a VOR frequency selected.",

Synthetic vision systems (SVS) project an animated image of the terrain and ground features on the background of the primary flight display. This enhances the perception of attitude from the usual blue and brown air/ground symbology to an illustrative image of the surrounding terrain, obstacles, water and land, thus creating a seemingly realistic view of the aircraft’s position even in IMC. SVS constructs a representation of the external environment by merging an improved digital terrain database with an obstruction overlay database. It generates a synthetic view solely relying on this dataset, devoid of any real sensor input or external data input.",

The HUD replicates the information on the primary flight display (PFD) by showing the following data: - Altitude is displayed on an altitude tape at the right-hand side of the screen. - Airspeed, including a speed trend vector, is displayed on the left-hand side of the screen. - Heading is displayed on the compass rose at the bottom of the screen. - A flight path vector to display the track and vertical flight path of the aircraft is positioned in the centre of the screen along with the pitch attitude of the aircraft. - The flight mode annunciator (FMA) is displayed at the top of the screen so that pilots can be situationally aware of the auto-flight status and auto-flight modes that the aircraft is operating in. - TCAS, TAWS, and wind shear command annunciations will also be displayed when appropriate. They will be displayed in the same positions as with the PFD.",

            "explanation": "Easa learning objective 022.13.03.01.03 states: Explain the need for standby instruments to supplement the EFIS in the event of all the display units failing and the challenge of using these standby instruments, namely their size and position on the flight deck. Easa learning objective 022.13.03.01.02 states: Describe the typical layout of the EFIS display units and how there may be a facility to transfer the information from one display unit on to another if a display unit fails. Aircraft with electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) must have an independent means of providing vital flight information to the pilots in the event of the failure of the EFIS displays OR their sources of information. EFIS installations are fed with data from an air data computer and inertial reference unit, this data is processed before being displayed on the multifunction displays. The electronic standby instrument display is fed from micro-electromechanical (MEMS) air data sensors connected to independent standby pitot and data sources. Attitude and heading information is provided by a MEMS gyro and the system is fed from a separate power source. Armed with this information it's tempting to make the mistake of selecting answer B as being correct. The answer says '.failure of an EFIS display' which implies the loss of one of the two displays not the loss of both. EFIS displays are selectable so the primary flight display (PFD) can be switched to the screen that's still working. Remember that EASA LO 022.13.03.01.03 stated the need for standby instruments in the event of all the display units failing! Another reason for having standby instruments is in case of failure of the source of information supplied to the EFIS system. Incorrect information fed from the pitot/static system, air data computer or inertial reference unit will result in erroneous information being processed and displayed on the EFIS displays. Electronic standby instruments use independent sources so they can be used to verify the information being displayed on the EFIS displays.",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a VOR/ILS mode, where the frequency of the VOR is indicated at the bottom. Figure 1 and 6 indicate is a full VOR and a full ILS mode respectively, on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom, figure 3 has no navaid tuned (no identifier displayed = MAP), and finally Figure 5 indicates ‘ILS’ at the bottom. Figure 4, however, has the VOR indication at the bottom left-hand corner and its frequency on the right. A course deviation scale is also displayed and further confirms that ND is a VOR mode display.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Based on student feedback, the official question includes an attachment illustrating the conditions mentioned in the question text. However, we have not yet obtained access to this official attachment. Whenever there is an unexpected fuel quantity indication, a message related to fuel in the FMC or engine display, or an imbalance condition arises, it's essential to consider the possibility of a fuel leak. Detecting a fuel leak can be aided by maintaining a fuel log and comparing the actual fuel burn to the planned fuel burn as part of the flight. It's important to note that there is no specific onboard warning for a fuel leak; it must be identified through changes or discrepancies in expected fuel consumption. Before engaging in any crossfeeding operations, it's crucial to ascertain that a fuel leak is not the root cause of the issue, as it could lead to total fuel loss. Pay close attention to parameters such as fuel flow, fuel usage, and total fuel quantity indications before deactivating any pump switches. If there is suspicion of an inflight fuel leak, take the following steps: turn off the fuel pumps for the center wing tank and close the crossfeed valve. Monitor the fuel tank quantity for any unusual drops and be alert to signs of a fuel imbalance, as these indicators can help confirm the presence of an engine fuel leak. Once an engine fuel leak is confirmed, either through visual observation or flight deck indications, it's imperative to shut down the affected engine to halt the leak and preserve the remaining fuel. After shutting down the affected engine, resume normal fuel management procedures. All remaining fuel can be utilized to power the operational engine safely.",

Synthetic vision systems (SVS) project an animated image of the terrain and ground features on the background of the primary flight display. This enhances the perception of attitude from the usual blue and brown air/ground symbology to an illustrative image of the surrounding terrain, obstacles, water and land, thus creating a seemingly realistic view of the aircraft’s position even in IMC. SVS constructs a representation of the external environment by merging an improved digital terrain database with an obstruction overlay database. It generates a synthetic view solely relying on this dataset, devoid of any real sensor input or external data input. The entire image is generated from a database, thus necessitating regular updates. However, these updates may not encompass temporary obstacles like cranes near airports. Furthermore, the virtual image is constructed based on the aircraft's reported position. If this position is inaccurate, the image aligns with the terrain stored in the database for the calculated position, rather than the actual terrain.",

Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint.",

IMPORTANT NOTE: This question raises some concerns and should be challenged or addressed if encountered in an exam. It is worth noting that the radio height typically becomes unavailable above 2 500 feet during the climb, making it invisible at FL150. Therefore, options stating \"4. Radio height\" cannot be correct. On the other hand, altitude information, flight director (FD) bars, and heading/track are all commonly displayed on the Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI) according to EASA's Learning Objectives. Hence, options 1, 2, and 3 appear to be accurate. However, the provided answer choices do not account for this possibility. If one had to eliminate one of the three options, it might be reasonable to discard heading/track since they are typically displayed below the traditional \"EADI\" presentation in the compass rose section of the Primary Flight Display (PFD). Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI) The Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI) is a crucial instrument used in aviation to provide pilots with essential flight information. It is typically located on the primary flight display (PFD) of an aircraft's cockpit. The EADI (or PFD) presents a dynamic colour display of all the parameters necessary to control the aircraft, and that the main layout conforms with the basic-T principle: Attitude information in the centre Airspeed information on the left Altitude information on the right Heading/track indication in the lower centre Flight mode annunciation at the top Takeoff and landing reference speeds along the airspeed tape and in the bottom right Minimum airspeed at the bottom of the airspeed tape Lower selectable airspeed at the top of the airspeed tape and adjustable from the speed window and speed selector on the MCP Mach number just below the airspeed tape The autoland status, pitch, roll-armed, and engage modes are selectable from the AFCS control panel.",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Typically, the radar antenna is located in the nose of the aircraft. Signals from the antenna are processed by a computer and presented on a screen which may be viewed by the pilots. Droplet size is a good indicator of strong updrafts within cumulonimbus clouds, and associated turbulence, and is indicated on the screen by patterns, colour coded for intensity. It needs to be noted that the frequency band of the radio waves (X band) is selected not to detect any cloud, small precipitation such as drizzle, fog or wind, as the droplets are too little or don’t exist. Some airborne weather radar systems may also be able to predict the presence of wind shear. *Green: light precipitation *Yellow (or amber): medium precipitation *Red: heavy precipitation *Magenta: Extremely high precipitation Radar Mode: Weather only Mode (WX) Weather + Turbulent Mode( WX+T): The areas which have strong turbulence will be showing in magenta on the display. This area is formerly showed in green on WX only Mode. Note: In an EFIS the MFD (multi-function display) displays navigational and weather information from multiple systems. MFDs are most frequently designed as \"chart-centric\", where the aircrew can overlay different information over a map or chart. Examples of MFD overlay information include the aircraft's current route plan, weather information from either on-board radar or lightning detection sensors or ground-based sensors, e.g., NEXRAD, restricted airspace and aircraft traffic",

Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) project an animated image of the terrain and ground features on the background of the primary flight display. This enhances the perception of attitude from the usual blue and brown air/ground symbology to an illustrative image of the surrounding terrain, obstacles, water and land, thus creating a seemingly realistic view of the aircraft’s position even in IMC.

Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint.",

Electronic Checklists Pilots must always be aware of the fact that when automatically generated electronic checklists are followed, the consequences of implementing the actions commanded by the checklist should be known. For example, shutting a system down as commanded by the checklist might mean that system cannot later be brought back online. When following an on-screen checklist associated with a failure scenario, the failure must be confirmed and acknowledged by both flight crew members prior to performing any of the actions that are commanded by the checklist. Before manipulating any guarded switches or thrust levers, confirmation must once again be sought by the flight crew member that is manipulating these controls.",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a PLAN mode. This mode is easily identifiable thanks to the True North orientation symbol at the bottom of the ND and the fact that you cannot see weather radar indications on this mode. Only Figure 2 displays the MAP mode.",

They are not part of the certified aircraft configuration, and they do not require any tools to be removed from flight-deck cradles if they have been fitted to the aircraft. Installed EFBs are electronic devices that are considered to be aircraft parts. They are covered by the aircraft airworthiness approvals. Therefore, in the event of their failure, installed EFBs are minimum equipment list (MEL) items. NOTE: The first figure depicts an integrated EFB. The second attached figure is a PED.",

The memory is composed of registers that are often only 32 bits. The CPU executes various programs by following the programmed instructions which are first examined and then executed in a sequential manner. It uses three buses for its internal communications with its built-in memory: one address bus, one data bus, and one control bus. When multiple tasks share common resources, such as the same CPU, it can be defined as” multitasking”. Multitasking gives the appearance of running several programs at the same time as the CPU switches rapidly between each program in turn. When two or more CPUs are used with a single computer, the operation is called “multiprocessing”. It is a hardware solution which main advantage is that it the computer’s speed will be greatly increased as it will be able to process larger amounts of information.",

Processing the recordings with the help of specific software to extract safety-relevant information, such as deviations from the operating procedures or abnormal parameter values. FDM contributes to increased flight safety and operational efficiency by: - Providing data to help in the prevention of incidents and accidents. - Improved operational insight: providing the means to identify potential risks and to modify pilot training programs accordingly. - Reduction in unnecessary maintenance and repairs. - Flight-monitoring data can be transmitted automatically using ACARS and be analyzed without delay.",

The EVENT button of the FDR can be used to set a time mark on a data storage that can further ease investigator’s task in determining the accident’s cause. The Flight Data Recorder system consists of an interface and management unit (the FDR computer), the recording system, a three-axis linear accelerometer, an ‘event’ button, and an underwater locating device. The type and number of parameters recorded by an FDR are determined by the recording capacity of the system and the applicable operational requirements. Generally, it will record plenty of technical flight related parameters such as time, pressure/radio altitude, power on each engine, heading, AP/FD and autothrust modes and pilots’ selections, airspeed, aircraft configuration (slats, flaps, gear), and many others. Strangely, this was reported as seen in an RNAV exam, however, that seems totally incongruous to us so is likely a mistake. Please let us know if you do see this in any other exams, thank you.",

A compass is freely suspended in the horizontal plane and the needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles. As you approach the poles, the angle between magnetic flux and the horizon becomes vertical – compass ‘dip’ becomes a factor => decrease in horizontal magnetic field, increase in vertical magnetic field.

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another.

Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

If the compass indication is different from this value, you simply turn the knob to make it indicate the runway track. This runway direction check can also be done to the standby magnetic compasses fitted to large commercial aircraft as a redundancy feature. However, it is never really performed under normal operation, as most of the flight operating procedures manuals do not require this check upon line-up. Since it’s a standby instrument, you can also compare its indication with the main instruments.",

This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate.

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The horizontal component is the part which is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles. As you approach the poles, the angle between magnetic flux and the horizon becomes vertical – compass ‘dip’ becomes a factor => decrease in horizontal magnetic field, increase in vertical magnetic field. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator (=midway between the two poles). A freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

HORIZONTAL COMPONENT The horizontal component (H) of the earth’s field is known as the directive force and it is the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian (providing a directional reference). Near the magnetic poles, the vertical component becomes much greater than at lower latitudes where the horizontal component dominates. This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",
