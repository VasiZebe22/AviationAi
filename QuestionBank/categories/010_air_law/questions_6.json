Note.— If an aircraft is in the distress phase, the rescue coordination centre has to be notified immediately in accordance with 5.2.1. The above regulation states that when the aircraft is in the distress phase (as is the case wen a distress message has been received), the ATSU (air traffic services unit) should immediately inform the rescue coordination centre. As per 5.5.1 above, the ATSU should advise the operator first when practicable if in the uncertainty or alert phase, but that is not the case here.",

Looking at the sources quoted in the Learning Objective above, we see that \"Consignments declared as personal effects and transported as unaccompanied baggage shall be cleared under simplified arrangements.\". The sources from the LO are shown in the two annexes above. This means that the customs documentation and arrangements for unaccompanied baggage that has been mishandled, etc. will be much simplified, over the requirements for standard cargo. This is in place to make it much easier for operators to get passengers their baggage back in the event of mishandling.

CMC's serve as an identity for crew members and provide them visa-free entrance when on duty seeking temporaty access to a state.

A situation wherein apprehension exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants. Distress phase (DETRESFA). A situation wherein there is a reasonable certainty that an aircraft and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger and require immediate assistance. Let's examine the given options: When there is a potential for a collision: This would correspond to the Distress Phase (DETRESFA), as it indicates a serious and immediate danger requiring urgent assistance. When the position of an aircraft is uncertain: This corresponds to the Uncertainty Phase (INCERFA), where there is concern due to a lack of information on the aircraft's position. When an aircraft has experienced a technical malfunction: This generally corresponds to the Alert Phase (ALERFA), indicating a situation where there is concern for the aircraft's safety, but it is not yet in the distress phase. When an aircraft is known to be in an emergency situation: This corresponds to the Distress Phase (DETRESFA), where the aircraft is in grave and imminent danger and requires immediate assistance.",

ICAO Annex 11 - Chapter 5 - Alerting service 5.2 Notification of rescue coordination centres 5.2.1 Without prejudice to any other circumstances that may render such notification advisable, air traffic services units shall, except as prescribed in 5.5.1, notify rescue coordination centres immediately an aircraft is considered to be in a state of emergency in accordance with the following: a) Uncertainty phase. b) Alert phase. c) Distress phase. 5.5.1 When an area control or a flight information centre decides that an aircraft is in the uncertainty or the alert phase, it shall, when practicable, advise the operator prior to notifying the rescue coordination centre. Note.— If an aircraft is in the distress phase, the rescue coordination centre has to be notified immediately in accordance with 5.2.1. The above regulation states that when the aircraft is in the distress phase (as is the case wen a distress message has been received), the ATSU (air traffic services unit) should immediately inform the rescue coordination centre. As per 5.5.1 above, the ATSU should advise the operator first when practicable if in the uncertainty or alert phase, but that is not the case here.",

(16) ‘serious incident’ means an incident involving circumstances indicating that there was a high probability of an accident and is associated with the operation of an aircraft, which in the case of a manned aircraft, takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, or in the case of an unmanned aircraft, takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down.

Regulation (EU) No. 996/2010 List of examples of serious incidents The incidents listed are typical examples of incidents that are likely to be serious incidents. The list is not exhaustive and only serves as guidance with respect to the definition of ‘serious incident’: a near collision requiring an avoidance manoeuvre to avoid a collision or an unsafe situation or when an avoidance action would have been appropriate, controlled flight into terrain only marginally avoided, aborted take-offs on a closed or engaged runway, on a taxiway, excluding authorised operations by helicopters, or from an unassigned runway, take-offs from a closed or engaged runway, from a taxiway, excluding authorised operations by helicopters, or from an unassigned runway, landings or attempted landings on a closed or engaged runway, on a taxiway, excluding authorised operations by helicopters, or from an unassigned runway, gross failures to achieve predicted performance during take-off or initial climb, fires and smoke in the passenger compartment, in cargo compartments or engine fires, even though such fires were extinguished by the use of extinguishing agents, events requiring the emergency use of oxygen by the flight crew, aircraft structural failure or engine disintegration, including uncontained turbine engine failures, not classified as an accident, multiple malfunctions of one or more aircraft systems seriously affecting the operation of the aircraft, flight crew incapacitation in flight, fuel quantity requiring the declaration of an emergency by the pilot, runway incursions classified with severity A according to the Manual on the Prevention of Runway Incursions (ICAO Doc 9870) which contains information on the severity classifications, take-off or landing incidents. Incidents such as undershooting, overrunning or running off the side of runways, system failures, weather phenomena, operation outside the approved flight envelope or other occurrences which could have caused difficulties controlling the aircraft, failure of more than one system in a redundancy system mandatory for flight guidance and navigation. As crew incapacitation is classed as a serious incident under ICAO Annex 13 and Regulation (EU) No. 996/2010, then it must be reported as such directly to the National Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authority without delay. (See annex above) Now this does actually also constitute an MOR report, as it can be seen in other questions. The serious incident report direct to the Safety Investigation Authority would cover this, but an operator should be made aware of the serious incident also, and may decide to send an MOR regardless, but it is not required.",

This is quite vague, and encompasses a lot of different occurrences Serious Incidents - \"An incident involving circumstances indicating that there was a high probability of an accident and is associated with the operation of an aircraft\". So effectively a bad incident that is not quite considered an accident. In this question, the aircraft is completely lost, so it easily fits into the category of accident. Note: There are two different learning objectives that cover this, one about ICAO annex 13, and the other referring to EU Regulation No.996/2010, but as both have the same definition of an accident, it does not matter.

Since there was no high probability of an accident, the scenario is not a serious incident and it is classified as an incident. Regulation (EU) No 996/2010, Article 1 (Definitions) (1) ‘accident’ means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which, in the case of a manned aircraft, takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, or in the case of an unmanned aircraft, takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down, in which: (a) a person is fatally or seriously injured as a result of: — being in the aircraft, or, — direct contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become detached from the aircraft, or, — direct exposure to jet blast, except when the injuries are from natural causes, self-inflicted or inflicted by other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways hiding outside the areas normally available to the passengers and crew; or (b) the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure which adversely affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component, except for engine failure or damage, when the damage is limited to a single engine, (including its cowlings or accessories), to propellers, wing tips, antennas, probes, vanes, tires, brakes, wheels, fairings, panels, landing gear doors, windscreens, the aircraft skin (such as small dents or puncture holes) or minor damages to main rotor blades, tail rotor blades, landing gear, and those resulting from hail or bird strike, (including holes in the radome); or (c) the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible; (17) ‘serious injury’ means an injury which is sustained by a person in an accident and which involves one of the following: (a) hospitalisation for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date the injury was received; (b) a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); (c) lacerations which cause severe haemorrhage, nerve, muscle or tendon damage; (d) injury to any internal organ; (e) second or third degree burns, or any burns affecting more than 5 % of the body surface; (f) verified exposure to infectious substances or harmful radiation. (7) ‘incident’ means an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of operation. (16) ‘serious incident’ means an incident involving circumstances indicating that there was a high probability of an accident and is associated with the operation of an aircraft, which in the case of a manned aircraft, takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, or in the case of an unmanned aircraft, takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down.

EU Regulation no. 996/2010 - Definitions (1) ‘accident’ means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which, in the case of a manned aircraft, takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, or in the case of an unmanned aircraft, takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down, in which: (a) a person is fatally or seriously injured as a result of: being in the aircraft, or, direct contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become detached from the aircraft, or, direct exposure to jet blast, except when the injuries are from natural causes, self inflicted or inflicted by other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways hiding outside the areas normally available to the passengers and crew; or (b) the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure which: adversely affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component, except for engine failure or damage, when the damage is limited to a single engine, (including its cowlings or accessories), to propellers, wing tips, antennas, probes, vanes, tires, brakes, wheels, fairings, panels, landing gear doors, windscreens, the aircraft skin (such as small dents or puncture holes) or minor damages to main rotor blades, tail rotor blades, landing gear, and those resulting from hail or bird strike, (including holes in the radome); or (c) the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible; Occurrences are mostly split into three categories: Accidents - The most dangerous type, explained above. Incidents - \"An occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of operation\". This is quite vague, and encompasses a lot of different occurrences. Serious Incidents - \"An incident involving circumstances indicating that there was a high probability of an accident and is associated with the operation of an aircraft\". So effectively an event that came very close to an accident. In scenario 1, the aircraft came very close to an accident, but none occurred, so it is classed as a serious incident. In scenario 2, the aircraft sustained significant damages to the airframe and landing gear, so even though no injuries occurred, the scenario is classed as an accident.",

As can be seen in the annexes above, the objectives of the two different regulations are slightly different. To start, they both aim to improve aviation safety, but the earlier regulation (996/2010) is based on the investigation of accidents and incidents, whereas the later regulation (376/2014) built on this, to improve the systems of reporting and storing relevant safety information for use in these investigations. To remember which way round these are, you can just think about what is most important, firstly it is best to improve the capability of the investigations (996/2010), to better learn from accidents/incidents. After this, we should improve the method of reporting the data in the first place (376/2014), to widen the scope of what the investigations can learn from.",
