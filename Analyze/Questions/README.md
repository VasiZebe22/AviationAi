## Feature Overview

The Questions feature follows a feature-first architecture pattern where all related components and hooks are contained within the feature directory. This organization promotes:

- Encapsulation of feature-specific code
- Clear boundaries between features
- Improved maintainability
- Easier navigation of codebase
- Self-contained feature development

## Key Design Principles

1. **Component Separation**
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Minimal prop drilling

2. **Custom Hook Extraction**
   - Complex logic moved to hooks
   - Reusable functionality
   - Clean component code

3. **State Management**
   - Centralized in main component
   - Passed down via props
   - Uses React hooks effectively

4. **Performance**
   - Memoization where needed
   - Efficient re-renders
   - Optimized data flow

## Development Guidelines

When working on the Questions feature:

1. Keep components focused on single responsibilities
2. Extract complex logic into custom hooks
3. Maintain clear documentation
4. Follow established patterns
5. Consider performance implications
6. Write tests for new functionality
