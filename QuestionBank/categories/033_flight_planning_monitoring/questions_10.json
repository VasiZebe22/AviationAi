The ground distance is the distance covered over the Earth’s surface. Ground speed is the aircraft’s speed over the Earth’s surface, i.e. the resulting speed that the aircraft travels across the Earth’s surface when wind is applied to the TAS. The ground speed is calculated by subtracting a headwind component or adding a tailwind component from TAS: Ground speed = TAS + tailwind component or Ground speed = TAS - headwind component Therefore, with a headwind, air distance is greater than ground distance. Note: This particular question falls outside the scope of Flight Planning (033); however, it has been brought to our attention that a student encountered it in their exam.",
