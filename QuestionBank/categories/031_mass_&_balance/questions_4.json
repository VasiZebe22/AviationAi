            "explanation": "The flaps on a transport aircraft are usually Fowler flaps, which move forward as they retract and this can cause a small but significant forward movement of the CG. A flap extension creates an opposite effect. The CG reference datum is on the nose compartment of the MRJT1 aircraft. Any load/mass shifting further aft creates an additional positive moment. Conversely, any load/mass shifting further forward creates an additional negative moment. A flap extension moves a mass further aft causing an additional positive moment and, conversely, a flap retraction moves a mass further forward reducing the moment. According to the figure, with flap retraction from 40° to 0°, the moment changes by -16 000 kg.in and with flap retraction from 30° to 0° the moment changes by -15 000 kg.in. In other words, the greater the flap retraction, the greater the mass forward movement, the greater the moment reduction. Thus, a flap retraction from 40° to 30°, moves the mass forward reducing the moment by: -16 000 kg.in -(-15 000 kg.in) = -1 000 kg.in.",

The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on the distribution of weight in the aircraft. The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The CG of an aircraft can move but must remain within certain forward and aft limits, for reasons of both stability and control. CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall.",

The Load/Trim sheet is in two parts: Part A (to the left) is a loading summary. Moreover, Part A is divided into three Sections. Section 1 (top) is used to establish the Limiting Take-off Mass and the Maximum AllowableTraffic Load that can be carried, Section 2 (middle) shows the traffic load distribution and Section 3 (bottom) sums up the load and cross checks that any limit has not been exceeded. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the certified envelope. It is where we plot graphically the positions of the CG of operational masses, such as Take off Mass, Zero Fuel Mass and Landing Mass. When completing load sheets, particularly for large aircraft, it is convenient to use an Index method to represent the large numbers involved and to simplify the calculations. Generally, Loading Index is a non-dimensional figure (i.e. a figure without unit of measurement) that is a scaled down value of a moment and the effect of reducing the magnitude of the moment to one that is much easier to use.",

Distance from mass to old CG: 15.5 m - 13.76 m = 1.74 m 4763 kg / 64 763 kg = Change of CG / 1.74 m Change of CG = 4763 / 64 763 x 1.74 = 0.13 m Since the initial CG position is aft of the datum and the LMC is added aft of the datum, the new position of CG will be shifted away from the datum and will be: New CG position = Old CG position + Change of CG = 13.76 m + 0.13 m = 13.89 m aft of datum 2nd METHOD CG = Total Moment / Total Mass Moment = Mass x Arm Total Moment = Old Moment + LMC Moment = 60 000 kg x 13.76 m + 4763 kg x 15.5 m = 825 600 + 73 827 = 899 427 kg m Total Mass = Old Mass + LMC Mass = 60 000 kg + 4763 kg = 64 763 kg CG = 899 427 kg m / 64 763 kg = 13.89 m Since the initial CG position is aft of the datum and the LMC is added aft of the datum, the new position of CG will be shifted away from the datum and will be 13.89 m aft of datum. (3) Check if the new CG is within limits CG limit: 16% - 46% New CG position: 13.89 m aft of datum. The new CG position needs to be converted into % MAC to check whether it is within the CG limitations.

The Load/Trim sheet is divided in two parts: Part A (to the left) is a loading summary. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aircraft not considering the usable fuel or the ZFM is the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) plus the Traffic Load (TL). Thus, according to the Load Sheet (Part A), the ZFM is: DOM + TL = 34 900 kg + 11 230 kg = 46 130 kg. In the Trim Sheet (Part B), the DOI is given, all the masses of the baggage compartments 1 and 4 are transferred and the number of passengers are given, too. So, follow through the grids moving in the direction of the arrows for the correct number of divisions, ignoring the fuel index, as The scale is marked on each grid. Once the line reaches the CG envelope, drop straight down until it crosses the ZFM, 46 130 kg. So, the Centre of Gravity in %MAC can be read as 17.8%.",

The bottom left block of the load sheet is used to calculate zero fuel mass, take-off mass, and landing mass, while the top part is used for determining the underload. Zero fuel mass is obtained by adding the dry operating mass and total traffic load. Assuming the correct input values of 39 000 kg for dry operating mass and 5 000 kg for traffic load, the zero fuel mass is correctly calculated as 44 000 kg. The landing mass is calculated by subtracting the trip fuel from the take-off mass. However, both the take-off mass and the trip fuel value entered in the lower section are incorrect (trip fuel is mistakenly entered as take-off fuel), leading to an incorrect landing mass calculation. Take-off mass is determined by adding take-off fuel to the zero fuel mass. The load sheet indicates a take-off fuel value of 10 500 kg in the upper section, but mistakenly, the trip fuel mass of 7 500 kg has been entered in the bottom section. As a result, the calculation for take-off mass is incorrect. To find the underload, three steps are involved. Firstly, the maximum values for zero fuel mass, take-off mass, and landing mass are determined and correctly entered in the top section of the load sheet. Next, the most limiting maximum mass (identified as the \"lowest of a, b, c\" on the load sheet) should be selected. In this case, the zero fuel mass should have been chosen. However, the highest limit, the take-off mass, was used instead, resulting in an erroneous underload calculation.",

Moment is the turning force created by the mass over a distance or lever arm: Moment = Mass x Arm Remember that, by convention, the items aft of the datum have a positive arm, and consequently a positive moment, and those which are forward of the datum have a negative arm and moment. Thus, since the nose landing gear jack point is forward of the datum (main landing gears jack points), both its arm and moment will be negative. Generally, the Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing by the total mass: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass. The Total mass of the aircraft is: 4 350 kg + (2 x 15 005 kg) = 34 360 kg and its Total Moment: [4 350 kg x (-12.2 m)] + [(2 x 15 005 kg) x 0] = - 53 070 kg.m.

Load/Trim sheet is a document which enables the Pilot-in-Command to determine that both the aircraft's load and its distribution throughout the fuselage are such that the mass and balance limits of the aircraft are not exceeded.

Section 2 shows the distribution of the traffic load. Section 3 is used to summarise load and cross check that limits have not been exceeded. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. In the left section, the Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) should be: Traffic Load (TL) + Dry Operating Mass (DOM) = 11 230 kg + 34 900 kg = 46 130 kg, instead of 46 230 kg. As a consequence, the Take-off Mass (TOM) and the Landing Mass LM) below are also incorrectly computed. The calculations from the Max ZFM until the Underload before Last Minute Changes (LMC) are correctly computed: Underload before LMC = Lowest Allowed Mass for Take-off (b) - Operating Mass - Total Traffic Load = 59 400 kg - 44 400 kg - 11 230 kg = 3 770 kg.",

Solving for Change of CG we get: Change of CG = (Distance Moved x Mass Change) / Total Mass = (517 in. x 500 kg) / 64 200 kg = 4 in. Since, the 500 kg baggage was loaded by mistake into the front cargo hold, instead of the rear, then the CG will move further forward and its new position will be: 640 in. - 4 in. = 636 in. aft of the datum.

Formula to be used: New Total Moment = Old Total Moment - Moment of Load Removal Moment = mass × arm CG = total moment ÷ total mass load = mass of load removal The new total moment can be calculated by multiplying the new mass by the new CG. We know the new CG (86) but we do not know the new mass, therefore we replace the new mass by subtracting a variable (our load removal) from the old mass: “4 000 - load”. New total moment = (4 000 - load) × 86 Old total moment = 4 000 × 85 The moment of the load removal is also unknown but we know the arm (22.5), therefore we can find the result by multiplying the variable with a value of 22.5: load × 22.5 The variable called “load” is the same which we used above, because the mass of the load removal will also reduce the total mass by the same value. New Total Moment = Old Total Moment – Moment of Load (4 000 - load) × 86 = 4 000 x 85 – load x 22.5 344 000 - 86 load = 340 000 – 22.5 load 63.5 load = 4 000 Load = 63 lb",

The Total mass of the aircraft is: 1 850 kg + (2 x 8 140 kg) = 18 130 kg and its Total Moment: [1 850 kg x (-10 m)] + [(2 x 8 140 kg) x 0] = - 18 500 kg.m. Therefore, the CG position of the BEM will be: - 18 500 kg.m / 18 130 kg = -1.02 m. The minus (-) symbol implies that the CG position is 1.02 m forward of the main landing gears.",

Current Situation: The AFT CG limit is 139 inches aft of the datum. However, due to the current arrangement of passengers, the CG exceeds the AFT CG limits by 3 inches (making the current CG at 142 inches aft of the datum). How may we bring the CG Forward by 3 inches to meet the CG aft limit without re-arranging the passengers? We will use an extra ballast (mass) forward of the aircraft (front seats) to bring the CG to the aft limit. How much Extra Ballast? CG is 3'' behind the aft limit. Therefore, the CG is 142'' aft of datum. Old Total moment = 2530 x 142 lb.in To bring the CG forward to within limits, a ballast (\"m\") must be added to the front seat. The front seat is located at 65'' aft of datum. Ballast moment = m x 65 lb.in The New Total Mass will be: New total mass = 2530 + m This will result in a New Total Moment: New Total Moment = (2530 + m) x 139 lb.in Now apply the formula: Old Total Moment + Moment of the ballast = New Total Moment 2530 x 142 + m x 65 = (2530 + m) x 139 2530 x 142 + m x 65 = 2530 x 139 + m x 139 m = 102.6 lb = 103 lb Alternatively, simply apply the following formula: New mass x New CG = (Old mass x Old CG) ± (mass x arm) (2530 + m) x 139 = (2530 x 142) + (65 x m) 351 670 + 139 m = 359 260 + 65 m 74 m = 7590 M = 102.6 lb ≈ 103 lb",

The location of the CG determines the aircraft's stability and maneuverability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. According to the figure, the CG of the aircraft are in the following positions: Aircraft A: CG located at 12.8% MAC. Aircraft B: CG located at 9.3% MAC. Aircraft C: CG located at 23% MAC. Aircraft D: CG located at 20% MAC. The CG of aircraft B is located closer to the aircraft nose (closer to the forward CG limit) than the rest of the aircraft. As a result, aircraft B is the most stable aircraft.",

Where large, awkward numbers are produced, the moments are sometimes divided by a constant to produce a moment index. It is described as a non-dimensional figure, that is a scaled down value of a moment and is used to simplify mass and balance calculations. A Loading Index (LI) is simply a Moment (Load Mass x CG Arm) divided by a constant: LI = (Load Mass x CG Arm) / Constant = Load Moment / Constant. For instance, a moment of 126 400 kg.in, may be referred to as an index of 1 264, divided by 100. Therefore, index is obtained by dividing the sum of the moments by a factor, in order to reduce its value.",

Remember that we need to move the CG 2 in aft. (1) “Remove 679,65 kg from the forward cargo hold 20 inches aft of datum” Mass Change / Old Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance from Mass to New CG Mass Change: 679.65 kg Old Total Mass: 62 800 kg Change of CG: ? Distance from Mass to New CG: From 204.8 in to 20 in => 184.8 in 679.65 kg / 62 800 kg = Change of CG / 184.8 in Change of CG = (679.65 kg x 184.8 in) / 62 800 kg = 2 in (2) “Add 1670,21 kg in aft compartment 280 inches aft of datum” Mass Change / Old Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance from Mass to New CG Mass Change: 1 670.21 kg Old Total Mass: 62 800 kg Change of CG: ? Distance from Mass to New CG: 280 in – 204.8 in => 75.2 in Change of CG = (1 670.21 x 75.2 in) / 62 800 kg = 2 in (3) “Move 483,07 kg from forward cargo hold 20 inches aft of datum to the aft cargo hold 280 inches aft of datum” Mass Change / Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance Moved Mass Change: 483.07 kg Total Mass: 62 800 kg Change of CG: ? Distance moved: from 20 in aft of datum to 280 in aft of datum => 260 in 483.07 kg / 62 800 kg = Change of CG / 260 in Change of CG = (483.07 kg x 260 in) / 62 800 kg = 2 in All of the methods presented by the available choices will result in a CG change of 2 in => therefore, \"All of the options are correct\".",

            "explanation": "For the swept wing aircraft, it is more convenient, for aerodynamic purposes, to relate the CG position to the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) of a wing. In this case the CG is expressed as a percentage of its position along the MAC (%MAC) from the leading edge (LEMAC). For this question: 30% MAC means that the CG is 30% along the MAC length (4.60 m), which corresponds to: 4.60 m x 0.3 = 1.38 m aft from the LEMAC. So, its initial CG position is: 14 m + 1.38 m = 15.38 m aft from the reference datum. 33% MAC means that the CG is 33% along the MAC length (4.60 m), which corresponds to: 4.60 m x 0.33 = 1.518 m aft from the LEMAC. So, its CG re-position will be: 14 m + 1.518 m = 15.518 m aft from the reference datum. So, the CG change is: 15.518 m - 15.38 m = 0.138 m, which means that after the new cargo load distribution, the CG moves more aft, because portion of the front cargo is transferred to the rear cargo compartment. The amount of mass which is transferred to the rear cargo compartment can be found applying the \"Shifting Load\" formula: Mass Change / Total Mass = Change of CG / Distance Moved. Solving for Mass Change, we get: Mass Change = Change of CG x Total Mass / Distance Moved = 0.138 m x 200 000 kg / (25 m -15 m) = 2 760 kg. Therefore, the new distribution load will be: Front Cargo: 6 500 kg - 2 760 kg = 3 740 kg. Rear Cargo: 4 000 kg + 2 760 kg = 6 760 kg.",

Moment = Mass x Arm Remember that, by convention, the items aft of the datum have a positive arm, and consequently a positive moment, and those which are forward of the datum have a negative arm and moment. Generally, the Centre of Gravity (CG) can be found by adding all the moments and then dividing by the total mass: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass Initially, the aircraft's moment was: 2 609 lb x (-58 in.) = -151 322 lb in. After adding the last minute load, the aircraft's moment became: -151 322 lb in. + (128 lb x 32 in) = -147 226 lb in Thus, the new position of the CG, after loading the last minute load will be: CG = Total Moment / Total Mass = -147 226 lb in / (2 609 lb + 128 lb) = -53.79 in.

Section 2 shows the distribution of the traffic load. Section 3 is used to summarise load and cross check that limits have not been exceeded. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. It is where we plot graphically the positions of the CG of operational masses, such as Take off Mass, Zero Fuel Mass and Landing Mass.",

The Load/Trim sheet is divided in two parts: Part A (to the left) is a loading summary. Part B (to the right) is the trim portion, which helps to establish the CG %MAC and ensure that it lies within the envelope. Landing Mass is the Take-off Mass of the aircraft less the trip fuel and can be calculated in the order indicated in Section 3 of the Part A (left side) of the Load/Trim sheet, as Thus, the Landing Mass is: Total Traffic Load + Dry Operating Mass + Take-off fuel - Trip fuel = 11 230 kg + 34 900 kg + 9 500 kg - 6 500 kg = 49 130 kg. Since the question asks for the Centre of Gravity at landing, the fuel index used, will be that for the Landing Fuel. The Landing Fuel is: Take-off fuel - Trip fuel = 9 500 kg - 6 500 kg = 3 000 kg, thus the fuel index used will be -4.3. In the Trim Sheet (Part B), the DOI is given, all the masses of the baggage compartments 1 and 4 are transferred, the number of passengers are given too and the fuel index for the landing mass is -4.3. So, follow through the grids moving in the direction of the arrows for the correct number of divisions, as The scale is marked on each grid. Once the line reaches the CG envelope, drop straight down until it crosses the Landing Mass, 49 130 kg. So, the Centre of Gravity in %MAC at landing can be read as 19%.",

Generally, Loading Index is a non-dimensional figure that is a scaled down value of a moment and the effect of reducing the magnitude of the moment to one that is much easier to use. For large aircraft, it is convenient to use an index to represent the large numbers involved and to simplify the calculations. Dry Operating Index (DOI) is the index for the position of the CG at the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). For this question, according to the figure, the DOI is given by the formula: I = [(CG - 25) x W x 0.029] + 100, where CG is in %MAC and W in 1000 kg. So, the DOI is: [(31.6 - 25) x 110.8 x 0.029] + 100 = 121.2. The correction on DOI for the additional flight crew member of 85 kg in zone E is: -0.98 x 85 kg/100kg = - 0.8. Thus, the corrected DOI is: 121.2 - 0.8 = 120.4.",

Better fuel consumption is achieved, range and endurance increases, but longitudinal static stability decreases. The aft limit is usually just in front of the wing’s Centre of Pressure and the optimum centre of gravity position is near the aft limit. Most modern aircraft use automatic fuel management to ensure that the CG remains at the optimum aft position in flight for range flying and best fuel economy. Tanks are generally located in the wings (outer and inner) and in a central position in the fuselage, but may also be found in the fin and the horizontal stabiliser. Fuel is fed from the tanks in the correct sequence to maintain wing bending relief and aft CG position. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and stabiliser (trim tanks) have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons. Firstly, to provide extra fuel capacity and range and secondly, to help maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum aft position.",

Solving for \"Distance from mass to new CG\" we get: Distance from mass to new CG = Change of CG x Old total mass / Mass change = 2.5 in. x 12 400 kg / 150 kg = 206.6 in. Since each seat pitch is 33 in, then the two passengers must move from the rear seat row to bring the CG on to the aft limit at least by: 206.6 in. / 33 in. = 6.26 rows.

The CG has to be calculated before each flight to make sure the aircraft within the safe envelope as exceeding limits can end up with danger, lower performance and fatalities. CG Calculation CG = Total Moment / Total Mass A moment is defined as the product of a mass and its balance arm (distance from a reference point) and can be expressed in meter-kilograms or inch-pounds. Moment = Mass × Balance Arm The moment is used to determine the torque created by the mass at a specific distance. Knowing the moments of various components (passengers, cargo, fuel) allows for the calculation of the overall center of gravity of the aircraft. In modern aircraft, digital systems can automate the process of caclulating the CG These systems include sensors that provide real-time data on weights and their locations, and computers that execute the moment calculations for all loaded components of the aircraft and then divide by the total weight of the aircraft to find the CG position. Then the system ensures that the CG is within operational limits.",

All the arms of the figure are positive, therefore the moments will be all positive and the BEM CG will be positive too, thus aft of datum. The Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aircraft not considering the usable fuel, i.e. is the DOM plus the Traffic Load. Thus, the ZFM moment is the total moment of the aircraft not considering the moment of usable fuel, i.e. is the DOM moment plus the Traffic Load moment. DOM is the BEM plus the Variable Load. For this question, to calculate the CG position for the BASIC EMPTY MASS (BEM), you have to calculate firstly the Moment for the BEM. The Moment for the BEM is: ZFM Moment - Pilot and Front Passenger Moment - Passengers (centre) Moment - Baggage Zone 1 Moment = (113.6 in x 3 794 lbs) - (85.6 in x 180 lbs) - (118.2 in x 420 lbs) - (21.8 in x 40 lbs) = 430 998in.lbs - 15 408 in.lbs - 49 664 in.lbs - 872 in.lbs = 365 074 in.lbs.

Generally, Loadind Index is a non-dimensional figure that is a scaled down value of a moment and the effect of reducing the magnitude of the moment to one that is much easier to use. For large aircraft, it is convenient to use an index to represent the large numbers involved and to simplify the calculations. A Loading Index (LI) is simply a Moment (Load Mass x CG Arm) divided by a constant: LI = Load Moment / Constant = (Load Mass x CG Arm) / Constant. Thus, the Dry Operating Index (DOI) is a DOM Moment (DOM x CG Arm) divided by a constant: DOI = DOM Moment / Constant = (DOM x CG Arm) / Constant. In simple words, DOI is the index of the position of the Centre of Gravity at the Dry Operating Mass (DOM).",

We will use an extra ballast (mass) forward of the aircraft (forward cargo) to bring the CG to the aft limit. How much Extra Ballast? The take-off CG is at 95 inches and the TOM is 3 800 lb.

Calculate the area of the ground supports in contact with the aircraft floor. It is suggested to work in m2 as the floor loading is given as 800 kg/m2. 0.2 m x 1 m = 0.2 m2 area per ground support. Two ground supports = 0.4 m2 total area. Step 2. Divide the floor loading limit by the area available: 1 m2 = 800 kg. 0.4 m2 x 800 kg = 320 kg allowed. The pallet and ground supports weigh 300 kg. With 320 kg allowed, this means that 20 kg may be added.",

The safety of the plane and its passengers comes first every time. ULD also allows: eliminate the need for manual loading and unloading protect cargo contents so that goods arrived undamaged maximise the use of the aircraft’s cargo space the fast and easy transfer of cargo between planes in transit To prevent the ULDs moving around during flight and potentially damaging the aircraft, the plane has loading and restraint systems.

The safety of the plane and its passengers comes first every time. ULD also allows: eliminate the need for manual loading and unloading protect cargo contents so that goods arrived undamaged maximise the use of the aircraft’s cargo space the fast and easy transfer of cargo between planes in transit To prevent the ULDs moving around during flight and potentially damaging the aircraft, the plane has loading and restraint systems.

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit. The position of CG is established by separately considering the empty aircraft and the items of load and fuel. The turning force or moment of each around a datum is calculated and then totalled to find where the total mass acts, i.e. the CG position. The Moment is determined by the total mass and the distance of the each item from the datum (Moment = Mass x Arm) and the CG position is determined by the total moment divided by the total mass (CG = Total Moment / Total Mass). The greater the distance from the datum (Arm), the greater the moment, thus the more aft the CG position for a given mass. Since the load is suddenly sliding and moving backwards, the distance between the sliding load and the datum increases, so its increased moment will increase the total moment too. Thus, the CG position will move aft.",

Solving the above formula for Length we get the smallest pallet length which does not exceed the Max Running Load: Length = 2419 kg / 1650 kg/m = 1.47 m Thus, only two dimensions of the pallet which do not exceed the Max Running Load limit could be correct: 1.48 m x 1.46 m and 1.50 m x 1.47 m However, the question asks for the optimum pallet size which occupies the least possible area in the aft cargo hold, without exceeding any running load limit, of course. So, compare the two areas that each one pallet dimensions occupy: A pallet size of 1.48 m x 1.46 m covers an area of 2,16 sqm. A pallet size of 1.50 m x 1.47 m covers an area of 2,2 sqm. Therefore, the correct dimensions which both comply with the maximum running load limit and optimise best the space in the cargo hold, are 1.48 m x 1.46 m. NOTE: The one of the dimensions should be more than 1.47 m otherwise running load limit will be exceeded.",

There are two floor loading limits to be considered: The distribution load intensity, either floor area or contact area. The running (linear) load. The Maximum Distribution Load Intensity is the maximum static mass per unit area, which the floor is designed to continuously carry and can be calculated by dividing the maximum load by the floor area it covers or the contact area: Maximum Distribution Load Intensity = Max Load / Contact or Floor Area. Solving the above the formula for Max Load, we get: Max Load = Maximum Distribution Load Intensity x Contact Area = 400 kg/m2 x (0.5 m)2 = 100 kg.",

The Maximum Distribution Load Intensity is the maximum static mass per unit area, which the floor is designed to continuously carry and can be calculated by dividing the maximum load by the floor area it covers or the contact area: Maximum Distribution Load Intensity = Max Load / Min Contact or Floor Area. Solving the above the formula for Min Floor Area, we get: Min Floor Area = Max Load / Maximum Distribution Load Intensity = 600 kg / 750 kg/m2 = 0.8 m2. The question asks for the minimum pallet size that can be used. So, the only pallet dimensions which are within limits (equal or more than 0.8 m2) and conform the smallest in size pallet are: 40 cm by 200 cm (0.4 x 2 = 0.8 m2).",
