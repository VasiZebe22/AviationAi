Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the \"break even fuel price\". You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop. Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass You would not tanker fuel BECAUSE the destination airport is below minima, but it is suitable to tanker if that is the case, as the extra weight does not affect us in that capability, and in fact, having the extra fuel is nice for potential diversions. However, tankering is a commercial procedure, and if the Commander wishes to take more fuel for weather diversion or holding, they should use \"extra fuel\" for that purpose.",

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Operating Mimima means minima for the IFR approach available, i.e. CAT ILS. Planning Mimima for a destination aerodrome are effectively the applicable approach operating minima. The RVR or visibility should be the same as or greater than the minima for the actual approach for a non-precision approach. Planning minima for alternate aerodromes are not the same as the aerodrome operating minima. Generally, higher cloud bases and visibilities are required than the minima. Thus, an alternate aerodrome with a CAT II approach allowing an RVR of 300 m would not be suitable for use as an alternate, unless the weather conditions were CAT I, 550 m RVR or better (allowing a safety margin). During the pre-flight planning procedure, the pilot must consider: Weather at Destination above Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Destination Alternate above Planning minima at ETA ± 1 hour. Weather at Take-off Alternate Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour. And after Take-off: Weather at Destination must be above Operating minima at ETA. Weather at Destination Alternate must be above Planning minima at ETA. Also, for a twin-engine aircraft, a Take-off alternate within 60 minutes flying time of the Deparure aerodrome with One-Engine-Inoperative must be considered. Therefore, the destination aerodrome can be considered as the Take-off alternate, thus no Additional fuel is required.",

            "explanation": "Find your optimum aircraft mass for tankering purposes: 1. Enter the table on the left-hand side with your fuel price ratio of 0.89. 2. Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 2650 NM by interpolating between 2500 NM and 3000 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 214 000 kg. If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering. Because the savings would be lost due to the excess fuel burn (higher fuel consumption based on the extra fuel mass). With regards to this question, Planned take-off mass: 190 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial. HOWEVER, first we must check if we are limited by the Maximum Take Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass or Maximum tank capacity. Maximum tank capacity is 55 000 kg and we already have 30 000 kg loaded in the tanks - therefore, we can fit in additional 25 000 kg. Our Maximum Take-Off Mass will be the lowest of Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) and Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel: MTOM = 205 000 kg Maximum Landing Mass + Trip Fuel = 180 000 kg + 22 000 kg = 202 000 kg (lowest) => This means that we could carry an amount of fuel equal to 202 000 kg - 190 000 kg = 12 000 kg additional fuel which is the correct answer to this question.",

Use the formula: NAM = NGM x TAS ÷ GS NAM = 4 000 x 450/400 = 4500 NAM Using the table provided, find your optimum aircraft mass for tankering purposes: 1. Enter the table on the left-hand side with your fuel price ratio of 0.90. 2. Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 4500 NM. 3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 178 000 kg. With regards to this question, planned take-off mass: 170 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial => an additional 8 000 kg (178 000 kg - 170 000 kg) should be carried. Note: If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering.",

If the Captain thinks that the weather is marginal or that the air traffic delays might be expected, then he can load extra fuel. This kind of decision is made largely based on experience and is often closely scrutinised by the Operator, as it adds to costs. Carrying an extra fuel, incurs a fuel penalty, because the increased mass means that the aircraft cruising level and/or performance are reduced. Thus, since the fuel consumption increases, due to the increased aircraft's mass, some of the extra fuel is consumed in carrying the extra mass. Therefore, to compensate for the increased fuel flow, the trip fuel must be increased, so as to have the desired fuel on board above the destination aerodrome.",

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price. You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if: Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass",

Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions. Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports.

OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy LOCATION OF THE FUEL EN-ROUTE ALTERNATE (FUEL ERA) AERODROME The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance, the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight plan distance, or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM, whichever is greater. All distances should be calculated in still air conditions. Considering the above we have: “The fuel ERA aerodrome should be located within a circle having a radius equal to 20% of the total flight plan distance” RADIUS: 1200 NM x 20% = 240 NM “the centre of which lies on the planned route at a distance from the destination aerodrome of 25% of the total flight”: 1200 NM x 25% = 300 NM “or at least 20% of the total flight plan plus 50 NM”: 1200 NM x 20% + 50 = 290 NM, whichever is greater. DISTANCE FROM DESTINATION: 300 NM => REFER TO FIGURE We take 300 NM from the destination aerodrome – that will be the centre of our circle of 240 NM radius => we can conclude that the centre of the circle will be located 900 NM (1200 – 300) from the departure aerodrome. We get ERA “X” located at 660 NM (900 – 240) from Departure aerodrome. Actual “X” is situated at only 600 NM. Therefore, we can conclude that “X” can not be considered an ERA - which means we can’t reduce contingency to 3% and instead we must take 5% contingency. CONTINGENCY: 5% x 7200 kg = 360 kg.

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (refer to the last paragraph of the explanation for full Regulation details) (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel 100 lb (2) Trip fuel 2 862 lb (3) Contingency fuel 143 lb (4) Alternate fuel 494 lb (5) Final reserve fuel 430 lb (6) Additional Fuel -- Total: 4 029 lb Note: The question includes tankering fuel to assess your understanding that it is separate from the minimum planning fuel necessary for departure. If it were necessary, it would have been categorized as extra or additional fuel. Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

Please let us know if you see this question and remember anything about it from the real exam, thank you! The trip fuel is calculated for a flight based on its expected routing, winds, cruise altitude, and aircraft weight. These can change, and therefore there are procedures in place to account for these changes. The addition of contingency fuel covers some of these changes, but a flight's OFP (operation flight plan) will often include a section detailing the change to fuel burn that comes from a weight change (1000 kg increase, for example) or a change in cruise altitude (for instance 2000 ft above or 2000 ft below the planned cruising level). In particular for this question, the weight change could occur from last minute changes to the passenger load, or some extra fuel that the commander decides to take. Any increase in aircraft weight increases the induced drag of the aircraft, thereby increasing the fuel burn. Any decrease in weight will therefore decrease the fuel burn. Applying the reduction in the question, 1500 kg weight reduction is 1.5 x the 1000 kg reduction, so you can just multiply the 205 kg fuel reduction by 1.5 to get a total trip fuel that is 307.5 kg less than the original trip fuel requirement (closest answer 308 kg)",

Also, the TAS at FL370 for a mass of 52 500 kg is: 432 kt, but because of TAT below the Standard TAT by 10°C, it decreases to: 432 kt - 10 kt = 422 kt. The aeroplane experiences a 25 kt headwind, thus GS = TAS - 25 kt = 422 kt - 25 kt = 397 kt. So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 150 NM is: Distance / TAS = 150 NM / 397 kt = 0.38 hr.

Now, the dashed lines represent FL370 and the solid lines represent FL100. You should interpolate between those 2 lines: Continue diagonally to the right following the reference line (a rough interpolation between the 2 reference lines) until you intersect the landing mass = 55 000 kg. Now, continue horizontally to the right and read the result of approx 17 000 kg. Find out the time required: From the intersection with the FL290 line, continue vertically up until you intersect the \"29 & ABOVE\" reference line. From this point, continue horizontally to the left until the ISA deviation reference line. Now, apply the ISA deviation correction (for ISA -10ºC) - continue diagonally upwards to the right and read a result of 6.15h (approx. 6 h 09 min) Closest option: 17 100 kg, 06 h 07 min",

There is no distance corresponding to 464 NM - therefore, we must interpolate between 451 NM - 70 min and 472 NM - 73 min => we get roughly 72 min for 464 NM. 5. Find the time necessary to fly 2000 NM. It will be the difference between 359 min and 72 min = 287 min 6.

MPA.150(b) Fuel policy PLANNING CRITERIA — AEROPLANES The operator should base the defined fuel policy, including calculation of the amount of fuel to be on board for departure, on the following planning criteria: (a) Basic procedure The usable fuel to be on board for departure should be the sum of the following: (1) Taxi fuel, which should not be less than the amount expected to be used prior to takeoff. Local conditions at the departure aerodrome and auxiliary power unit (APU) consumption should be taken into account. (2) Trip fuel, which should include: (i) fuel for take-off and climb from aerodrome elevation to initial cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (ii) fuel from top of climb to top of descent, including any step climb/descent; (iii) fuel from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (iv) fuel for approach and landing at the destination aerodrome. (3) Contingency fuel, except as provided for in (b), which should be the higher of: (i) Either: (A) 5 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight; (B) not less than 3 % of the planned trip fuel or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 3 % of the trip fuel for the remainder of the flight, provided that an en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome is available; (C) an amount of fuel sufficient for 20 minutes flying time based upon the planned trip fuel consumption, provided that the operator has established a fuel consumption monitoring programme for individual aeroplanes and uses valid data determined by means of such a programme for fuel calculation; or (D) an amount of fuel based on a statistical method that ensures an appropriate statistical coverage of the deviation from the planned to the actual trip fuel. This method is used to monitor the fuel consumption on each city pair/aeroplane combination and the operator uses this data for a statistical analysis to calculate contingency fuel for that city pair/aeroplane combination; (ii) or an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions. (4) Alternate fuel, which should: (i) include: (A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure; (B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing; (C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing; (D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and (E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome; (ii) where two destination alternate aerodromes are required, be sufficient to proceed to the alternate aerodrome that requires the greater amount of alternate fuel. (5) Final reserve fuel, which should be: (i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or (ii) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, calculated with the estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate aerodrome or the destination aerodrome, when no destination alternate aerodrome is required. (6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit: (i) the aeroplane to descend as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome in the event of engine failure or loss of pressurisation, whichever requires the greater amount of fuel based on the assumption that such a failure occurs at the most critical point along the route, and (A) hold there for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions; and (B) make an approach and landing, except that additional fuel is only required if the minimum amount of fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(2) to (a)(5) is not sufficient for such an event; and (ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome. (7) Extra fuel, which should be at the discretion of the commander",

(b) In-flight fuel management (1) The flight shall be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than: (i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel; or (ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required. (2) If an in-flight fuel check shows that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is less than: (ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required, the commander shall take appropriate action and proceed to an adequate aerodrome so as to perform a safe landing with not less than final reserve fuel. 2. According to AMC1-CAT. OP.

Since it is expected that only 8 out of the 15 minutes will be burnt on arriving at destination due to traffic, that means that the aircraft is expected to land with the final reserve fuel in tanks.

ISA temperature at FL330 = 15 - 2 x 33 = -51ºC; OAT = -30ºC => Therefore, ISA +21ºC 2. Enter the graph. Draw a vertical line from the bottom of the chart from a value of 720 NM until the Wind Reference Line. 3. From this point, apply the headwind correction equivalent to 20 kts headwind by drawing a slightly curved line upwards until you intersect the 20 kts headwind line. 4. Continue vertically upwards to intersect the FL330 line. From this point, we will have 2 different lines: Find out the fuel required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue horizontally to the right until the \"Landing Weight\" Reference Line. Now, the dashed lines represent FL370 and the solid lines represent FL100. You should usually choose to interpolate between those 2 lines, but here you can just try to parallel the dashed lines for FL370 as a reference since our cruising level of FL330 is much closer to FL370 than FL100. We have interpolated in the annex above for best accuracy, but when drawing these by hand, that kind of accuracy is very difficult to acheive. Continue diagonally to the right following the reference line (FL370) until you intersect the landing mass = 50000 kg (ZFM) + 2000 kg (Final Reserve) + 1000 kg (Alternate Fuel) = 53 000 kg. Now, continue horizontally to the right and read the result of approx 4800 kg. Find out the time required: From the intersection with the FL330 line, continue vertically up until you intersect the \"29 & ABOVE\" reference line. From this point, continue horizontally to the left until the ISA deviation reference line. Now, apply the ISA deviation correction for ISA +21ºC (slightly off the scale but just use +20) - continue diagonally downwards to the left and read a result of 1.9 hours or 1 h 54 m. At this section on the vertical scale, every small box is worth 3 minutes Closest option: 4800 kg, 01 h 54 min",

            ],
            "explanation": "Refer of figure. If the cost of fuel at destination is higher than the cost at departure, then it is better to tanker cheaper fuel at the departure. But, when tankering additional fuel, the aircraft's mass increases, thus, the fuel consumption inceases too, incurring extra cost. The decision to tanker fuel is then based on a comparison of the two costs and the sector distance. The figure involves a comparison of cost (by calculation of the fuel price ratio: departure fuel price divided by destination fuel price) and then for a given sector distance, we get the \"OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS\", which is the MTOM that permits fuel tanking. So: If the OPTIMUM TOM < Planned TOM, then do not fuel tank. If the OPTIMUM TOM > Planned TOM, then tanker an extra fuel amount equal to the difference: Planned TOM - OPTIMUM TOM. To get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS, apply the following steps: Enter with the fuel price ratio of 0.915. Move horizontally to the right until cossing the air distance line 2 000 NM. Continue vertically down to get the OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS 208 000 kg. Also, check if any limit is exceeded: The OPTIMUM AIRCRAFT TAKE-OFF MASS (208 000 kg) is more than the MTOM (205 000 kg). Thus, the aircraft can not carry more than: MTOM - Planned TOM = 205 000 kg - 185 000 kg = 20 000 kg of extra fuel for tankering purposes. Planned T/O fuel + Extra fuel = 30 000 kg + 20 000 kg = 50 000 kg, which is greater than the Tank capacity (40 000 kg) by 10 000 kg. So, the Extra fuel must be reduced by 10 000 kg to able to be loaded. So, the Revised Extra fuel because of being Tank capacity-limited is: 20 000 kg - 10 000 kg = 10 000 kg. Actual Landing Mass after tankering Extra fuel = Planned TOM - Trip fuel + Extra fuel = 185 000 kg - 18 000 kg + 10 000 kg = 177 000 kg, which is greater than the MLM (175 000 kg) by 2 000 kg. So, the previously Revised Extra fuel (10 000 kg) must be further reduced by 2 000 kg, so as not to exceed the MLM structural limit. So, the Final Revised Extra fuel, because of MLM-limited, is: 10 000 kg - 2 000 kg = 8 000 kg.",

Read corresponding value of 174 200 kg. Third Step: Correct 174 200 kg for climbing. Aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. Intersect cruising speed of 0.82 with our mass at brake release 210 000 kg (\"210\") - find a value of 2.9 (2900 kg) - Note that fuel consumption is higher in climb (resulting in a lighter aircraft) => subtract 2900 kg from 174 200 kg = 171 300 kg Fourth Step: Correct 171 300 kg for descent. Again, aircraft will fly at the optimum flight level - therefore, use the bottom table. For a mass of 170 000 kg (\"170\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg) and for a mass of 180 000 kg (\"180\") correction = 1.0 (1000 kg).

N/A FOR (b)(1) – we have a value of 10 000 kg + 275 kg = 10 275 kg (2) The sum of: (i) taxi fuel; N/A (ii) trip fuel to the destination 2 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance A-C-ALT: 900 NM + 200 NM = 1100 NM Flight time: 1100 NM / 400 kt = 2.75 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 2.75 h x 2000 kg/h = 5500 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount calculated in accordance with (a)(3)(*) above from departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome; 5500 kg x 5% = 275 kg (iv) alternate fuel, if a destination 2 alternate aerodrome is required; N/A (v) final reserve fuel; N/A (vi) additional fuel; and N/A (vii) extra fuel if required by the commander. N/A FOR (b)(2) – we have a value of 5500 kg + 275 kg = 5775 kg => We will, therefore, choose the highest value which corresponds to (b)(1) => 10 275 kg. SECOND SCENARIO (DECISION POINT OVER D): (1) The sum of: (ii) trip fuel to the destination 1 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance ADB: 2000 NM Flight Time = 2 000 NM / 400 kt = 5 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 5 h x 2000 kg/h = 10 000 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than 5 % of the estimated fuel consumption from the decision point to the destination 1 aerodrome; Distance DB: 900 NM Flight time: 900 NM / 400 kt = 2.25 h 2.25 h x 2000 kg/h = 4500 kg Contingency = 5% x 4500 kg = 225 kg (.) FOR (b)(1) – we have a value of 10 000 kg + 225 kg = 10 225 kg (2) The sum of: (i) taxi fuel; N/A (ii) trip fuel to the destination 2 aerodrome, via the decision point; Distance A-D-ERA: 900 NM + 200NM + 200 NM = 1300 NM Flight time: 1300 NM / 400 kt = 3.25 h FF: 2 000 kg/h Therefore, Trip Fuel = 3.25 h x 2000 kg/h = 6500 kg (iii) contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount calculated in accordance with (a)(3)(*) above from departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome; 6500 kg x 5% = 325 kg (.) FOR (b)(2) – we have a value of 6 500 kg + 325 kg = 6 825 kg => We will, therefore, choose the highest value which corresponds to (b)(1) => 10 225 kg. We must compare both greatest values obtained (10 275 kg and 10 225 kg). We can conclude that, when moving DP from C to D, the Fuel required will decrease by 10 275 kg – 10 225 kg = 50 kg. NOTE: An exhaustive explanation has been created so you can understand where the value comes from but no calculation is needed: it needs understanding that when you move the DP closer to destination the amount of fuel needed decrease as in Decision Point procedure the contingency fuel for destination is only from DP to destination. As DP move closer to destination, the contingency fuel decrease.",

Referring to the table which allows us to find the cruise consumption, find the effective range for a weight of 48 000 kg => Enter the first column under “GROSS WT. kg”, track downwards until you find “48 000”, read the value under the second column “0” which corresponds to 48 000 kg. According to the table, the range equals 2862 NAM. TAS can be read off the table. TAS = 426 kt. As OAT = ISA, no temperature correction is applied to TAS. In 2 hours cruise (minimum additional fuel), the distance covered = 2 h x 426 kt = 852 NAM. Since we do not have to travel a distance on the ground, we do not need to compensate for the wind. To determine the aircraft’s weight at the end of the 2 hours, we must subtract the required distance in air miles for 2 h (852 NM) from the effective range (2862 NM) which corresponds to 48 000 kg: 2862 – 852 = 2010 NM Now we must find out to which weight 2010 NM corresponds to: In the table, we can find 2009 NM (which is close enough), corresponding mass = 43900 kg (aircraft mass after 2 hrs flight) Fuel consumption in 2 hrs = 48 000 kg - 43 900 kg = 4100 kg Closest Answer = 4095 kg",

The total amount of fuel required for this commetcial flight should include the following fuel quantities: Taxi fuel + Trip fuel + Contingency fuel + Alternate Fuel + Final reserve fuel. Therefore, we have: Taxi Fuel: The Taxi fuel includes the fuel expected to be used prior to take-off and the fuel consumed by the use of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). In this question, the APU usage at the parking position is 0 minutes. For the calculation of the taxi fuel, we take into consideration the fuel consumption only at the departure aerodrome. Fuel flow during taxi: 11 kg per minute Planned taxi time: 10 minutes Taxi fuel = 11 kg/min x 10 min = 110 kg Trip Fuel: Average fuel flow is 2618 kg/h. We must calculate the flight time. We have TAS = 421 kt and average wind component = - 24 kt (headwind) ⇒ Ground Speed = TAS - Headwind component = 421 kt - 24 kt = 397 kt. With a Ground Speed of 397 kt (397 kt = 397 NM/h), the time required to cover the distance of 748 NM is: Time = Distance/Ground Speed = 748/397 Given that the flight time is 748/397 h and the average fuel flow is 2638 kg/h, the Trip fuel is: Trip fuel = (748/397) h x 2618 kg/h = 4 932.65 kg (approx. 4 933 kg) Contingency fuel: Question states that Contingency fuel is 5% of the Trip fuel. Since the Trip fuel is 4 933 kg, the Contingency fuel is: Contingency fuel = 0.05 x 4 933 kg = 246.65 kg (approx. 247 kg) Alternate fuel: Question states that Alternate fuel equals 550 kg. Final Reserve fuel: According to EASA Air Ops (AMC1 CAT. OP. MPA.150(b) Fuel Policy), the Final reserve fuel for an aeroplane with turbine engines, is the fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1500 ft above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions. From the question, the holding fuel flow is 2 250 kg/h. As a result, the Final reserve fuel is: Final reserve fuel = (30 x 2 250)/60 kg = 1 125 kg The total amount of fuel required for this commercial flight is: Total fuel = 110 kg + 4 933 kg + 247 kg + 550 kg + 1 125 kg = 6 965 kg.",

            "explanation": "The Point of Safe Return (PSR) is the last point on a route at which it is possible to return to the departure airfield, arriving back with the required fuel reserves still available in the fuel tanks. The time an aircraft takes to reach at PSR is given by the formula: Time taken to PSR = (E x H) / (O + H), where: E = Safe Endurance based on the available fuel, H = GS Home and O = GS Out. For this question, the wind direction is exactly opposite to the track, thus the Groundspeed Out (O) is: O = TAS - Wind component = 100 kt - 30 kt = 70 kt and the Groundspeed Home (H): H = TAS + Wind component = 100 kt + 30 kt = 130 kt. So, substituting all the known values, we get: Time taken to PSR = (E x H) / (O + H) = (3 hr x 130 kt) / (70 kt + 130 kt) = 1.95 hr or 1 hr 57 min. Therefore, the aircraft will reach overhead PSR at: 14:00 + 01:57 = 15:57.",

As NOTAMs are the only option here (NANUs are not an option), then that is the correct answer. Also, GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure that those services are available for the time of usage. Augmentation such as GBAS, SBAS and RAIM check for errors and correct them and/or notify the flight deck of integrity faults. RAIM can be checked in advance of making a flight or particular GNSS based procedure, using some onboard avionics systems, or on the ground beforehand using the AUGUR RAIM prediction tool.",

            "explanation": "The answer is VDF and not ATC clearance even though the frequency falls in the VHF Communication range, the NOTAM would mention an alternate frequency if the voice channel transmitter was not available. VHF Direction Finding VDF VDF provides a means of determining the aircraft bearing from a ground station. VDF stations are capable of measuring the direction of arrival of radio transmissions from aircraft. In earlier days, such a service operated in MF, HF, and VHF bands. Today, the service (for civil aviation) operates on frequencies from 118 to 137 MHz in the VHF band. These frequencies are identical with the working frequencies of the aircraft communication radio. If the communications transmitter on an aircraft is tuned to the VDF frequency and the transmitter is activated, the aerials at the VDF unit will detect the incoming transmission and each aerial element will feed a signal to the VDF receiver. Since the aerial elements will all be at slightly different distances from the source of the signal, each will detect a slightly different phase of that signal at the same instant. On some VDF units a simple digital read out gives the bearing. A ground DF station can give true or magnetic bearings. It is common to use the so-called «Q-codes»: QTE True bearing from the station QDR Magnetic bearing from the station QDM Magnetic bearing to the station QTF Position of a station taken by bearings from D/F stations QUJ True bearing to the station In practice, only QDM and QDR are normally used. The accuracy of the bearing is measured in degrees. Bearings are categorised, in accordance with the ICAO defined classifications, as given in the following list: Class A accurate within ± 2° Class B accurate within ± 5° Class C accurate within ± l0° Class D accuracy less than Class C Due to topography, some VDF stations are approved for use within certain sectors only. In that case, specific information for that aerodrome will be given in AIP. Stations that are listed in the AIP provide a ‘homing’ service. Generally the class of bearing is no worse than class B. (Many states will not permit Class C & D bearings to be provided). Ground DF stations should not be used as en-route navigation aids. Source: nordian.net",

For the still air case, the point of equal time is half way between the two aerodromes. This is not likely and so the PET is not half way between the two aerodromes. The calculation of the PET is based on a ratio of the groundspeed to the destination and groundspeed back to base. As there’s a wind coming from North west so it will be tail wind for the way from NewYork to Amsterdam and will make the flight faster, however in the way back that will be headwind and will make the flight longer which makes the point of equal time move closer to New York. (Remember point of equal time always moves into wind)",

Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Where, E = Safe endurance based on available fuel; H = Ground speed home; 0 = Ground speed out Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 280º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 070º 5. Note that this heading would result in 3ºR drift and a track of 073º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 070º. This occurs at a heading of 067º with 4ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 133 kt. GS out: 250º 5. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 246º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 254º with 4ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 107 kt.

Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Where, E = Safe endurance based on available fuel; H = Ground speed home; 0 = Ground speed out Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 105 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 215º 5. Note that this heading would result in 9ºL drift and a track of 206º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 215º. This occurs at a heading of 224º with 6ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 88 kt. GS out: 035º 5. Note that this heading would result in 6ºR drift and a track of 041º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 035º. This occurs at a heading of 029º with 6ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 121 kt. We can now apply the formulas: Time (to PSR) = E x H / 0 + H Time to PSR = 2.5 x 88 / 88 + 121 = 1.053 h To find the distance from the departure airport to the PSR, we simply multiply the time to PSR by the GS OUT: 1.053 h × 121 kt ≈ 127 NM.",

These messages are released 72 hours in advance of planned maintenance. These messages are also used to notify users of unscheduled outages. General NANUs can be used to disseminate general GPS information. Outages come in two varieties: planned and unplanned. Planned are all the activities/events that have been scheduled and that could potentially have an impact on the Signal-in-Space (SiS) and/or the performance levels. Planned NAGUs aim to inform users about the activity/event with a reasonable advance notice, ahead of their occurrence. The planned outages, in space or ground segment, can potentially cause an outage of the broadcast satellite SiS. A planned outage will be announced ahead of time and usually means some sort of maintenance is taking place. Unplanned are all the activities/events that have an impact on the SiS and/or the performance levels that have not been scheduled and could not be foreseen in advance, before their occurrence. The aim of unplanned NAGUs is to inform users about the activity/event within a reasonable time, after their occurrence. The difference between the planned and unplanned outages of GPS is that a planned outage is well recognisable during flight preparation, because relevant monitoring tools and NOTAMs will most probably indicate some problems. On the other hand, in case of unplanned outage, it is possible that the pilot will become aware mid-flight that integrity is lost. Therefore, the pilot should develop and maintain good practise in using backup conventional navigation whenever possible.",

It will cover notifications of temporary information (usually of less than 90 days duration), or permanent information not yet included in the AIP. The NOTAM refers to the St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport (LSZR) in Switzerland. In Item E), the notification of the NOTAM is described using ICAO abbreviations. A decode of this is as follows: SBAS is unavailable for approaches to LPV minima. GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure they are available for the time of usage. Thus, it is important before flight to check that there will be enough satellites visible and any potential outages at all stages of the flight, but especially for the destination airfield and alternate. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. The source for Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) guidance is the GNSS, which can provide guidance to an unlimited number of aircraft at multiple locations. To enable use of LPV minima, the aircraft must be fitted with both an LPV capable FMS and a compatible SBAS receiver. LPV minima take advantage of the high accuracy guidance and increased integrity that an SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, etc.) provides. European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a type of Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) for Europe.",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 125 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 057º 5. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 066º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 057º. This occurs at a heading of 048º with 10ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 134 kt. GS out: 237º 5. Note that this heading would result in 11ºL drift and a track of 226º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 237º. This occurs at a heading of 248º with 10ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 112 kt. We can now apply the formulas: Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home) Distance to PET = (134 x 470) / (112 + 134) Distance to PET = 256 NM Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out",

To do this, you must ensure planned outages, maintenance or orbital corrections are not expected at the time of flight. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. RAIM functions by monitoring the real-time satellite signal strength and integrity in order to ensure reliable GNSS position tracking. RAIM alone gives current conditions and does not warn of planned outages. For predictions, you could use the AUGUR RAIM prediction tool, which would inform you of when the satellite signals would be inadequate for an accurate position fix over a certain area, however these prediction tools mainly focus on satellite geometry and whether or not there are a sufficient number of satellites. Temporary degradations in signal strength/availability caused by GNSS interference testing for example, are usually only stated in NOTAMs. These NOTAMs specify the areas and times where signal degradation may occur due to non-satellite-related factors. Since these disruptions are external and temporary, they won't be shown in RAIM predictions, which mostly assess satellite performance.",

NOTAMs will NOT tell you if GNSS is available, it is always assumed to be available, but they may tell you it will be unavailable at a particular location, in which case, you must plan to use conventional navigational aids and procedures. If, for an IFR flight, there are no conventional procedures available, it means that the flight cannot be made to that airport. As we are given no further information, this is what we must assume.",

It is also called \"differential GPS\", and can correct for errors induced by satellite clocks, ephemeris and ionospheric propagation to make the augmented GNSS signal very accurate. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas. GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station (which is generally an airport). The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently (but with the ability to carry out full auto-lands with appropriate legislation), and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach. The availability of GBAS augmentation depends solely on the airport in question, in this case, Malaga. They are the ones who run the GBAS receivers, ground station and VDB transmitter, and therefore will mark any planned unserviceabilities as NOTAMs. It is quite tempting to choose the AUGUR RAIM prediction as the correct answer, and this might give the pilot an idea as to how many satelllites should be available for the GNSS system, but this is not what is being asked in the question.",

On your flight computer, on the \"AIRSPEED\" window, align 9000 ft with -13ºC. On the Inner ring, look for CAS 190 kt and read the corresponding TAS value of approx. 214 kt. (2) Now, that we know our TAS - we can calculate our GS using TAS and Wind: Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track. 1. Set wind direction to 320º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. 2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 214 kt. 3. Mark the wind velocity 40 kt down from the centre point. 4. Initially, set the True Track under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. GS home: 170º 5. Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 165º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 170º. This occurs at a heading of 175º with 5ºL drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 248 kt. GS out: 350º 5. Note that this heading would result in 7ºR drift and a track of 357º. 6. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 350º. This occurs at a heading of 343º with 5ºR drift. 7. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 178 kt. (3) We can now apply the formulas: Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home) Distance to PET = (248 x 350) / (178 + 248) Distance to PET = 203.8 NM Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out",

It includes all of the usable fuel on board, including any reserves. Endurance = the time airborne before the tanks run dry. TAS=140 kt, if the average wind is +15, it means it is tailwind, so Ground speed => 140 + 15 = 155 kts Trip distance 412 NM = 155 * t (time) = 2.66 hours =>160 minutes We also need to find Contingency Fuel => if the trip time 2.66 hours and fuel flow per hour is 430 kg, we will burn (430 *2.66) = 1 144 kg, Contingency fuel 5% trip fuel =>1 144 * 0.05 = 57 kg If we burn 430 kg per hour, we can airborne 8 minutes with 57 kg contingency fuel.

(c) Route (including changes of speed, level and/or flight rules) For this question we are given cruising speed in IAS. Therefore, we must convert it to TAS using the flight computer.

The wind correction angle is the angle by which the pilot adjusts the heading to compensate for the crosswind component of the wind. Under the forecasted wind, the wind is causing the aircraft to drift to the right, necessitating a wind correction angle to the left.

Rate of climb (ft/min) = Climb Gradient (%) x GS (kt) If we convert GS unit from kt to ft/min → 245 kt x 6 080 ft / 60 min = 24 827 ft/min Rate of climb (ft/min) = 4% x 24 827 ft/min = 993 ft/min",

Set wind direction to 080º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 155 kt. Mark the wind velocity 35 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 113º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 122º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 113º. This occurs at a heading of 104º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 124 kt. Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (-)7ºL WCA",

Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (170 knots). Position the wind direction (110º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (142º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (170 knots). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 9º left correction (-9º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 9ºL corresponds to a drift of 9ºR.",

In this case, with quite poor visibility, due to the haze and the Sun to the West, the best way to navigate given here is to use the large line features of the highway and the river, which can be followed all the way to the destination. It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated. The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (190º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (179 kt). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 10º right correction (+10º).

The aircraft follows a Westerly magnetic track from Schärding Süben (LOLS) to Pfarrkirchen (EDNP) aerodromes. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for a westerly magnetic track, Even FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft should be flown (2 500 ft, 4 500 ft, 6 500 ft, etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 6 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides obstacle clearance too. It is a bit higher than you might usually use for this route, but it is perfectly acceptable nonetheless. Line features (rivers, motorways, railways, etc.) are highly recommended for navigation in VFR flights. The Rott river, as a line feature, is very helpful, because it is aligned with the Westerly flight direction and runs very close to the route. The A3 motorway does not follow the route. The aircraft during its descent towards Pfarrkirchen (EDNP) destination aerodrome, will be within a Class F airspace with vertical limits from 1 500 ft AGL - 2500 ft AGL, initially, and as approaching to the destination aerodrome will remain within a Class F airspace with vertical limits from GND - 2500 ft AGL.",

For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, 9 500 ft etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 9 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and flight level Upon inspection of LOGI, we can see that it is situated between 4 different areas with different Grid MORAs (Minimum Off-Route Altitude). We must take the highest Grid MORA, in order to ensure that we have a safe vertical separation. The aircraft must fly at 10 800 ft. This must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 800/1000) = -648 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 11 448 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1018 hPa - 1013 hPa = 5 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (5) x 30 ft/hPa = 150 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 448 - 150 = 11 298 ft Since we are a VFR flight, we are required to fly at altitudes that are whole thousands plus 500 feet. The only altitude above 11 298 ft which also obeys this rule is FL115. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            ],
            "explanation": "First considerations: To obtain a terrain clearance of 2 000 ft, the aircraft must be flown at a true altitude of = 6 011 ft + 2 000 ft = 8 011 ft When flying Flight Levels, the altimeter is set to Standard Pressure (1013 hPa). Pressure Correction: Note: If QNH is higher than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is higher than IA. If QNH is lower than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is lower than IA. Local pressure equals 990 hPa which is lower than standard pressure by 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft Indicated Altitude = True Altitude + Pressure Correction Indicated Altitude = 8 011 ft + 690 ft = 8 701 ft Semicircular Flight Rules: IFR flight levels/altitudes are divisible by 1 000 ft (i.e. 7 000 ft, 8 000 ft, 9 000 ft). The VFR rules of flight level and/or altitude selection is the same as IFR ones with adding 500 ft to all levels. The default worldwide semi-circular rule is the East/West orientation of the flight level parity: Your aircraft has track between 0° and 179°, your flight level or altitude must be odd; Your aircraft has track between 180° and 359°, your flight level or altitude must be even. The appropriate altitude or flight level must be determined using the magnetic track (not heading). In this case, True Track (TT) equals 356º, applying the magnetic Variation provided (10ºW), we can find the Magnetic Track (MT) Variation West, magnetic direction BEST; Variation East, Magnetic Direction LEAST. MT = 356º + 10º = 006º According to the rules shared above, an ODD flight level + 500 ft must be used: First available Flight level above 8 701 ft => FL95",

Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The aligned with the route LOLC to LOGI plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 137o. Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart. For better accuracy, measure the distance between the centre of the two aerodrome symbols.

            ],
            "explanation": "When planning a route, the pilot will use visual check points to monitor the flight progress along a flight leg. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps, do not necessarily show up well from the air. Thus, the pilot, among others, should consider: Proximity to planned track: Ground features on or close to the track are preferred. Size and uniqueness: Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent will be easier to identify. Time of the year: Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. Planned Altitude: At lower levels, a selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Some of the problems faced by a pilot during VFR navigation at lower levels are the following: The horizon may be obscured by high ground, so attitude flying is difficult. Frequent changes may be needed to maintain the correct airspeed, while climbing or descending over undulating ground. The view ahead and around is restricted by the next fold of high ground. The angle at which you are looking becomes flatter and if a feature does not have some vertical extent (such as towers and wind farms), you are unlikely to see it at low level. A selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time (such as a river). Thus, towers and wind farms are the most suitable ground features for low level VFR navigation. But, among them, the best ones are those which are along the route and as close to the departure airport as possible, because the pilot will be aware of any drift or time deviation at the initial stages of the cruise phase proceeding in minor recalculations. Therefore, the visual reference landmark which best covers the forementioned criteria is the unlighted tower North of the town of Emmendingen, with elevation of 1 384 ft. NOTE: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. The current correct answer is the one that we have received feedback that is correct in the Austro, but we also see that in different authorities \"The unlighted tower North of Emmendingen town\" is marked as correct.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Altitude selection: Before the route is recorded on the flight plan, we need to consider the altitude to fly at. The Minimum Grid Area Altitudes along the route are 5 400 ft, 7 200 ft and 4 100 ft. For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 7 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too. In portions of the whole route, a lower altitude could be flown, 5 500 ft, but with less vertical obstacle clearance provided, probably poor comms signal and encountered turbulence. Ground feature selection: Line features, such as highways, which cross vertically the intended track are highly recommended as ground features for navigation in VFR flights. Both Highways, A3 and A92, as line features, are very helpful for groundspeed and timing checks, because they both cross vertically the track. But among them, the A3 highway is more preferred since it is almost halfway. Of course, the Power plant at Vilshofen (1 593 ft) could be selected as a VFR checkpoint, since it covers the criteria that should be considered for a VFR ground feature selection, but the question asks for the best. NavAid selection: Between the LNZ and FRE VOR/DME, the former is the best to tune to, even just after take-off (if both relief and VOR’s range permit), since it easily leads to the destination, almost directly, with an insignificant course deviation.",

Center your plotter at EDMC aerodrome symbol, since the question asks for the track from EDMC aerodrome. Align the upper section of your plotter with the line which connects the two aerodromes. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The aligned with the route EDMC to EDSA plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 251o. The two aerodromes are close to the 2oE isogonal. Thus, following the rhyme \"Variation East, Magnetic least\", the magnetic track is: 251oT - 2oE = 249oM Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart.

Calculate the Cruise Time from LIRJ to LIRS: Cruise distance / Groundspeed = 24 NM / 134 kt = 0.18 hr or 10.7 min. 3. The time required from the destination Marina Di Campo (LIRJ) aerodrome to the alternate aerodrome Grosseto (LIRS) is the sum of the following: Time to climb from LIRJ to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing: 3 min. Time to cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing: 10.7 min. Time to descent from top of descent to LIRS: 4 min.

The only possible known point for defining a VFR waypoint via bearing and distance is the airport reference point (ARP). An airport reference point (ARP) is a known and well-defined location on an airport used as a reference for navigation purposes. Using the ARP as a waypoint in a GNSS flight plan provides a reliable and accurate navigation aid for VFR flights, especially when flying within controlled airspace. This is because the ARP is precisely located on aviation charts and is well-known to air traffic controllers, making it easier to communicate your position to ATC if necessary. Power lines, major cities and large towns, and coastlines may be visually identifiable landmarks that can assist with navigation, but they are not as precise and reliable as using an airport reference point. Additionally, power lines may not always be visible, and coastlines can be affected by changing weather conditions, tides, and other factors, making them less reliable as navigation aids. Major cities and large towns can be useful as general orientation points but may not provide the necessary precision needed for accurate navigation within a controlled airspace.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­300 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 18 000 ft - 300 ft = 17 700 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (18 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-21 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-11 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (17 700/1000) = + 708 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 17 700 ft + 708 ft = 18 408 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations. According to the Learning Objective 033.02.01.07.08, the advantages of a Global Navigation Satellite System/Flight Management Computer (GNSS/FMC) equipment are: Automatic calculation and display of tracks and leg distances Additional route information in the database (minimum altitudes, approach procedures) Time and fuel estimates over waypoints Ability to adjust speed to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time Time and fuel revisions based on predicted and actual wind",

Some services will also provide advisory avoiding action. Thus, the PIC when \"under vectors\", should follow the ATC's instructions. In a radar environment, heading information given by the pilot and heading instructions given by the controllers are in degrees magnetic. Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA), also known as Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), is the lowest alltitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during vectoring. MRVA allows the ATC to vector and descent an aircraft below MSA to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Therefore, the pilot should turn left to head 285°(M) and descend to 2300 feet.

The runway characteristics are in the bottom-right section of the approach chart for Jeppesen charts, just next to a quick visual summary of the missed approach. This is used for a quick reference in the late stages of the approach as what the runway should look like (and if you don't see it, the early missed approach instructions are just to the right of it, which is useful). In this case, the runway has a HIALS (High-Intensity Approach Lighting System) type II, which looks like the picture shows. This is a large and very bright approach lighting system, often used for CAT II and III landings also, as the lights penetrate through low visibility well. Therefore, the answer is \"a high-intensity system\" as the question asks specifically about the approach lighting type. PAPIs are also present, which are visual glide slope indicators.
