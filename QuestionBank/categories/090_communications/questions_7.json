Note.— The abbreviated term “ADS contract” is commonly used to refer to ADS event contract, ADS demand contract, ADS periodic contract or an emergency mode. The ADS (Automatic Dependent Surveillance) is a FANS application that consists in automatically sending aircraft surveillance data to the ATC. The set of data to downlink is defined automatically, without any crew action. The different types of ADS contracts can be: Periodic – at periodic time intervals. On demand – when asked for by the ATC. On event – whenever a specified event occurs. Emergency messages can also be sent through the ADS application. When a MAYDAY datalink message is sent to the ATC, the ADS contract is switched to a high periodic reporting rate.",

VOLMET - continuous and repetitive voice broadcast covering an area and several airports' current METAR, SPECI, TAF and SIGMET. In this question, the crew need to collect the weather information for a number of airports in order to decide on a diversion option. The clue in the question is 'the quickest way to obtain weather information'. Calling several airports on the radio to ask for individual weather reports would take time and is normally not practical. ATC at major airports would not have the time to issue such reports. Selecting ATIS is an option but it would take time to individually collect the reports for several airports, and there is the question of being in range to receive the signal. VOLMET is the quickest option and using D-VOLMET (Datalink) ensures no problem with radio range.",

Therefore, we should attempt to make contact on an alternative suitable frequency. These can be found on en-route charts, and if those are not available or cannot be contacted, then 121.5 MHz can be used to establish comms and ask for a suitable frequency based on your position. If you do happen to have recently changed over to the frequency, in the last couple of minutes for instance, then it might be worth enquiring on your previous frequency about alternative frequencies to use.| Therefore, a few of these options are partially correct as part of working out an alternative frequency to use, but the only fully correct answer is to \"find an alternative frequency.\"",

There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

Air Traffic Control (ATC) plays a vital role in coordinating the response to the emergency. Once ATC is aware of the situation, they will coordinate with relevant authorities, including search and rescue services and ground-based emergency personnel, to respond to the incident. Ground-based emergency services, such as Police, Fire Departments, and Forest Fire Protection, will be notified by ATC or other relevant authorities about the crash and the location. They will then respond to the incident to provide assistance and carry out necessary rescue and recovery operations. The emergency frequency is used by any official personnel who are helping the aircraft, so the answer \"Police, ATC and Forest Fire Protection\" is chosen as the correct one.

This is a bit tricky, the flight is not in grave danger but someone onboard is and that person may require immediate medical assistance upon landing (this is not explicit in the question text). If you were to ask me, I would declare PAN PAN. For following reasons: - I will get a priority over all other traffic, except for aircraft in distress (rightfully so) - Mayday would start opening options I won't use (opening of closed runways and airports, etc.). While medical emergency on board, the safety of the flight shall not be put in a jeopardy. We need priority, but not at the cost of safety, normal landing will be performed. - Mayday will trigger emergency protocols at airports, preparing for crash landing (EHAM, highway closures), which we don't need. - What we need is to land at nearest suitable airport without delay, taxi to a stand (close to the runway) and get medics in for the passenger.

The electric and magnetic fields oscillate at 90° with one another and the direction of propagation. Polarisation is affected by the plane of the aerial - a signal will only be effectively received if the receiving antenna is in the same alignment as the transmitting antenna: For efficient reception, if the transmitting antenna is vertical, the receiving aerial should also be vertical.

At VHF frequencies and above, space wave propagation is achieved. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is: 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Shielding by parts of the aircraft: When aircraft parts are shielding the signals, the line of sight propagation is being interrupted and the signal might not reach the receiver antenna. Static interference: A significant amount of static electricity is produced in the atmosphere due to weather conditions, human activities, and geological processes. The impact of static interference is more pronounced at lower frequencies. However, at VHF and higher frequencies, the effect of this interference is usually minimal. Ionospheric refraction: During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Sky wave interferance: It is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. These sky waves cause interference to the original ground waves and are related to LF and MF bands.",

            "explanation": "A discrete VHF frequency shall, whenever practicable, be used for Voice-ATIS broadcasts. VHF is amplitude modulated direct (line of sight) waves - practically straight-line propagation. Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. The range of VHF propagation is the function of transmitter power: R = 2 x √P Where: R is the range [NM] P is the power [W] The maximum distance at which one may expect solid VHF contact: R = 1.23 x (√H + √h) Where: R is the range [NM] H is the height over terrain [ft] h is the elevation of the station] The actual range depends on the height of the antenna. Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb. Another point to note is that transmission reception is highly dependant upon line of sight. When we are flying around at 15 000 feet, there are very few obstructions that our transmissions have to deal with.",

We can say that attenuation is affected by a number of factors, including: The materials a signal travels through => the higher the density of the material – the higher the attenuation. Frequency and wavelength => higher frequencies and lower wavelengths suffer from higher attenuation – because they have a higher number of peaks which causes a higher number of energy fluctuations and energy loss over distance, being more prone to attenuation. SUMMARY: Attenuation increases as: air density increases wavelength decreases frequency increases air temperature decreases Note: with regards to the air, provided that pressure remains constant – the lower the temperature, the higher the density => attenuation increases with temperature decrease.",

The reception of VHF transmission is normally influenced by the level of aircraft and terrain elevations. VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication and unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area. VHF is also less affected by atmospheric noise. On the other hand, obstacles do impair the reception of VHF communications - the straight line joining the transmitter and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception, due to the presence of hills, mountains, bumps on the surface of the Earth and the roundness of the Earth itself. You may expect a solid reception when the aircraft is at high level in the vicinity of the ground station. Note: Curvature of the Earth limits effective range because VHF waves do not follow the Earth's curvature.",

The reception of VHF transmission is normally influenced by the level of aircraft and terrain elevations. VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication and unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area. VHF is also less affected by atmospheric noise. On the other hand, obstacles do impair the reception of VHF communications - the straight line joining the transmitter and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception, due to the presence of hills, mountains, bumps on the surface of the Earth and the roundness of the Earth itself. You may expect a solid reception when the aircraft is at high level in the vicinity of the ground station.

Airband is often used for referring to the VHF spectrum between 108 MHz and 137 MHz, which covers its use for commercial and general aviation, radio-navigational aids, air traffic control and other uses. In common use among aviation professionals, the range of frequencies is sometimes referred to as VHF or Victor. Military aircraft also operate using additional frequencies (225 - 400 MHz) which are not part of the airband. The lower part of the spectrum, from 108 to 117.975 MHz, is reserved for navigational aids such as VOR beacons and Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), and precision approach systems such as ILS or LAAS. Some types of aviation-related stations, such as NDBs and DMEs, do not operate on these frequencies; in the case of NDBs the longwave frequency spectrum is used. The rest of the airband (118 - 137 MHz) is allocated to voice communications using amplitude modulation. Channel spacing on the airband has been 25 kHz. However, increasing congestion has led to further subdivision into 8.33 kHz channels in the ICAO European region; all aircraft flying above 19 500 feet (FL195) are required to be capable of handling this reduced spacing. A switch to digital radios has been contemplated, as this would greatly increase capacity by reducing bandwidth. However, this has yet to happen, partly because the mobility of aircraft necessitates complete international cooperation.",

When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. The range of VHF propagation is the function of transmitter power: R = 2 x √P Where: R is the range [NM] P is the power [W] The maximum distance at which one may expect solid VHF contact: R = 1.23 x (√H + √h) Where: R is the range [NM] H is the height over terrain [ft] h is the elevation of the station] The actual range depends on the height of the antenna. Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb. Another point to note is that transmission reception is highly dependant upon line of sight. When we are flying around at 15 000 feet, there are very few obstructions that our transmissions have to deal with.",

Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use. Channel spacing in the airband has been 25 kHz.

Thus, an aircraft at FL400 has more VHF range than one flying at 15 000 ft. Therefore, in order to improve your reception, one techinique is to initiate a climb. Another point to note is that transmission reception is highly dependant upon line of sight.

If a discrete frequency is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel(s) of the most appropriate terminal navigation aid(s), preferably a VOR, provided the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the navigation aid is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated. ATIS is transmitted on a VHF frequency channel. VHF radio waves are transmitted as space waves (direct waves) and require line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. This means that transmission is by straight line, or direct wave, and no obstacles should exist between the transmitter and the receiver. Uneven terrain, intervening high ground, mountains, man-made structures etc., cause VHF signal to be stopped, reflected, or bent, affecting its reception. Climbing to a higher level ensures no obstacles exist between the transmitter and the receiver, allowing line of sight transmission. Maximum VHF theoretical reception range (NM) = 1.23 × (√h1 + √h2) where h1 = receiver height in feet AMSL, and h2 = transmitter height in feet AMSL. Therefore, when the receiver height increases, the VHF reception range increases as well. Climbing at a higher altitude ansures line of sight and increases the ATIS VHF reception range.",

The primary mode of propagation for VHF radio waves is through direct waves. These travel in a straight line, becoming weaker as distance increases. Transmitting and receiving antennas must be able to 'see' each other for communications (Line of sight) to be effective, so antenna height is critical in determining range. The straight line joining the sender and the receiver must be relatively free of obstacles. Low level flight reduces greatly the range of reception (because of mountains, hills, etc).",

However, during certain weather conditions, the “lost” signal can be bent back towards earth and received much further away than normal. Potentially, this signal can travel greater distances. This is called super refraction or atmospheric ducting. When refraction is less than normal then it is called sub-refraction. What causes atmospheric ducting? Ducts need a marked temperature and a rapid decrease in humidity with height. Normally, the higher you go into the atmosphere, the colder it is. However, high pressure can cause a temperature inversion. This is where a layer of air in the troposphere will be at a higher temperature than the layer below it. Some of the radio signals from a transmitter bounce back towards the ground and potentially up again. The inversion effectively creates a duct for signals to travel along.",

We firmly believe that this question should be appealed. The primary responsibility of GROUND control is to manage and monitor surface movements, which encompass the movement of aircraft on the runway. In some instances, an aircraft that has landed, and is still on the runway, may be transferred to GROUND from TOWER control. The GROUND controller will then provide clearance for the aircraft to proceed to its designated parking area. In addition to aircraft movements, GROUND control is also responsible for regulating the movements of vehicles operating on the aerodrome surface. This includes the coordination of the movement of baggage trolleys, fuel trucks, and other ground vehicles that support aircraft operations. By doing so, GROUND control ensures the safe and efficient operation of the aerodrome surface. Movement area.

One-way communication from aircraft to stations or locations on the surface of the Earth. ICAO Annex 10, Volume 2, Communication Procedures Simplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations takes place in one direction at a time. Note.— In application to the aeronautical mobile service this method may be subdivided as follows: a) single channel simplex; b) double channel simplex; c) offset frequency simplex. *Single channel simplex. Simplex using the same frequency channel in each direction. *Offset frequency simplex. A variation of single channel simplex wherein telecommunication between two stations is effected by using in each direction frequencies that are intentionally slightly different but contained within a portion of the spectrum allotted for the operation. *Double channel simplex. Simplex using two frequency channels one in each direction. Duplex. A method in which telecommunication between two stations can take place in both directions simultaneously. Note: the term \"half-duplex\" is not mentioned by ICAO and EASA. Students also have not reported that \"half duplex\" has been mentioned in exams, but only simplex and duplex. In several other sources you can get the following information: Simplex: communication in one direction only Half duplex: communication in both directions (alternating) Full duplex: communication in both directions (simultaneously)",

We have, therefore, updated the correct answer to the only possible answer. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam. Thank you. SELCAL is abbreviated for Selective Calling System and it is used in international aviation to alert flight crews of transmission directed to them as they fly transoceanic routes. SECAL operates on HF or VHF frequency bands. An individual aircrafts owns its unique SELCAL code which is used by the controller to address the SELCAL on board of the aircraft. The code is converted into four designated audio tones, then it is broadcast and every aircraft, which has a SELCAL system, receives it. The decoding system reads the tones and triggers a warning for the flight crew if it recognizes its own code. Relating phraseology: When an aeronautical station initiates a call by SELCAL, the aircraft replies with its radio call sign, followed by the phrase “GO AHEAD”. Request SELCAL check XX-XXX (SELCAL code of the aircraft) SELCAL check is coming up for XX-XXX SELCAL OK or NEGATIVE SELCAL ICAO Annex 10 Volume II CHAPTER 5. AERONAUTICAL MOBILE SERVICE — VOICE COMMUNICATIONS 5.2.4 SELCAL procedures 5.2.4.1.1 PANS.— With the selective calling system known as SELCAL, the voice calling is replaced by the transmission of coded tones to the aircraft over the radiotelephony channels. A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",

(4.4.) Note 2.— Caution must be exercised with respect to the indication of transmitting channels in VHF radiotelephony communications when all six digits of the numerical designator are used in airspace where communication channels are separated by 25 kHz, because on aircraft installations with a channel separation capability of 25 kHz or more, it is only possible to select the first five digits of the numerical designator on the radio management panel. 2.4.5 In airspace where all VHF voice communications channels are separated by 25 kHz or more and the use of six digits as in 2.4.4 is not substantiated by the operational requirement determined by the appropriate authorities, the first five digits of the numerical designator should be used, except in the case of both the fifth and sixth digits being zeros, in which case only the first four digits should be used. Note 1.— The following examples illustrate the application of the procedure in 2.4.5 and the associated settings of the aircraft radio management panel for communication equipment with channel separation capabilities of 25 kHz and 8.33/25 kHz: (4.5.)",

If anyone encounters a similar question, we kindly request that you inform us. We appreciate your assistance. Thank you! SELCAL is a system used by air traffic control to selectively call individual aircraft over RT channels, which means that the flight crew doesn't have to monitor the channel continuously, especially on long-haul flights. So, we can actually say that it may be used by the controller to start a conversation. As for the \"correct\" answer, it's not entirely accurate to say that SELCAL is used to permit the controller to give instructions or clearance. The controller can give instructions or clearance even if the aircraft is not equipped with SELCAL. The primary purpose of SELCAL is to alert the crew that they need to make contact with ATS and to provide aural and/or visual cues through cockpit call systems. In short, SELCAL is used to alert the crew to contact ATS and eliminates the need for continuous monitoring of the RT call-sign. When an aircraft receives a SELCAL notification, the crew responds with their call sign and \"go ahead\".",

The call should be made on the frequency in use at the time, and the station addressed will normally be that station communicating with the aircraft, or the station in whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating. All other stations should take care not to interfere with the transmission of urgency traffic. => With regards to this question, there is no reason to call \"MAYDAY\" - we are not facing a distress situation - it is rather a possible technical malfunction (which is yet to be confirmed).",

More comprehensive phrases are contained in subsequent Chapters in the context in which they are most commonly used. 3.8 The precise phraseology used in the transmission and acknowledgement of climb and descent clearances will vary, depending upon the circumstances, traffic density and nature of the flight operations. 3.9 However, care must be taken to ensure that misunderstandings are not generated as a consequence of the phraseology employed during these phases of flight. For example, levels may be reported as altitude, height or flight levels according to the phase of flight and the altimeter setting. Therefore, when passing level messages, the following conventions apply: 1. The word ‘to’ is to be omitted from messages relating to FLIGHT LEVELS. 2. All messages relating to an aircraft’s climb or descent to a HEIGHT or ALTITUDE employ the word ‘to’ followed immediately by the word HEIGHT or ALTITUDE. Furthermore, the initial message in any such RTF exchange will also include the appropriate QFE or QNH. Furthermore, the words FEET and FLIGHT LEVEL must never be omitted. NOTE: Even though regulation states that the term “TO” shall be followed by altitude, it seems that the correct option does not state “Altitude”. Therefore, we would say that the most correct option is “Climbing to two thousand five hundred feet.” As there is no “Climbing to altitude two thousand five hundred feet” option available.",

A single selective call consists of a combination of four pre-selected audio tones whose transmission requires approximately 2 seconds. The tones are generated in the aeronautical station coder and are received by a decoder connected to the audio output of the airborne receiver. Receipt of the assigned tone code (SELCAL code) activates a cockpit call system in the form of light and/or chime signals. 5.2.4.5.2 PANS.— When so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements, calls for scheduled reports from aircraft may be initiated by an aeronautical station by means of SELCAL. 5.2.4.5.3 PANS.— Once SELCAL watch has been established by a particular aircraft station, aeronautical stations should employ SELCAL whenever they require to call aircraft.",
