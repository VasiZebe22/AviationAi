These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

            "explanation": "SMOKING AND HYPOXIA Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

On the 25th of October 1999, a SunJet Aviation Learjet 35 crashed in South Dakota, after 4 hour ghost flight through US airspace. This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

This disturbance of the acid balance has a number of effects, the major one being that haemoglobin gives up its oxygen readily only in an acid medium. As a result, tissues suffer from lack of O2. Some causes of sudden hyperventilation include anxiety, fear, severe pain, fever, some medicines, intense exercise, and emotional stress. Note: The aim of pressure breathing is to create a higher pressure and thus better oxygen diffusion in your lungs; for example, by exhaling through pursed lips. The technique has to be trained, because it can lead unintentional, faster than required respirationm and excessive loss of carbon dioxide. Thus if not executed correctly, pressure breathing can cause hyperventilation.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Packing sunblock is essential for protecting your skin from harmful UV rays during any outdoor activities. “Tight-fitting dark-colored clothing to repel mosquitoes”: Dark-colored clothing may actually attract mosquitoes rather than repel them. Loose-fitting, light-colored clothing is generally recommended to help prevent mosquito bites, as mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors and can bite through tight clothing. \"Sunglasses to filter the strong infra-red light from the sun\": Sunglasses primarily protect against UV rays and not infra-red light. “A wide-brimmed hat to protect the head from the intense sunlight”: Advisable.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Student feedback has confirmed the present correct answer to this question. Our interpretation suggests that the examiner is emphasizing safeguarding against insects and mosquito bites, rather than addressing endemic intestinal disorders and bacterial transmission in tropical climates and underdeveloped countries. Tropical climates introduce a range of challenges for pilots and travelers to account for. The high temperatures are just one facet of the equation. Additionally, many less economically developed countries are situated within this region. Within these economically disadvantaged nations, inadequate hygiene and sanitation pose significant issues. Pathogens are transmitted by insects that act as carriers, transporting them from one host to another. Mosquitoes and other biting insects extract blood from animals and humans alike. Attracted by exhaled carbon dioxide, body heat, and skin, mosquitoes pose an unwelcome reality for those journeying to tropical and other warm climates. Fortunately, a variety of straightforward measures can be adopted to minimize the likelihood of insect bites: Opt for fully covering attire, including long trousers, long-sleeve shirts, and socks. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. Steer clear of outdoor activities during dawn and dusk (early morning and evening). Eliminate sources of stagnant water in the vicinity, as mosquitoes tend to breed there. Employ insect nets and screens to prevent insects from entering. Utilize a fan or air-conditioner to maintain air circulation, thereby impeding their flight It is recommended to wear appropriate clothing - Long-sleeved shirts and long trousers are a must in malaria zones. Exposed skin should be protected with insect repellents; the head and neck must be protected from direct exposure to the sun.",

External Respiration: External respiration refers to the gas exchange between the alveoli and blood capillaries of the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into the blood during external respiration. Carbon dioxide (by product - cells waste) diffuses out from the blood into the alveolar air during external respiration. The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate. If the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is too high, you will breth faster and deeper to eliminate CO2.",

Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible.

Diabetes, stress and alcohol are related to hypertension. Diabetes damages arteries and makes them targets for hardening, called atherosclerosis. That can cause high blood pressure. Your body produces a surge of hormones when you're in a stressful situation. These hormones temporarily increase your blood pressure by causing your heart to beat faster and your blood vessels to narrow. Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily raises your blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increases.",

The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly?",

            "explanation": "The four statements include aviation examples for four forms of hypoxia: “1. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolize oxygen.” CORRECT. This statement refers to histoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histoxic hypoxia. “2. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurization and supplemental oxygen.” CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"3. A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control. Body feedback will be wrong and only by reference to the aircraft instruments can safe control of the aircraft be maintained.",

This can lead the pilot to believe they are too high and result in a lower approach, potentially causing the aircraft to land before reaching the runway. To counter this illusion, pilots should be aware that when approaching an upsloping runway, they may feel higher than their actual altitude. Therefore, it is advisable to plan for a longer landing on the runway to compensate for this perception. A DOWNSLOPING RUNWAY can create the illusion that the aircraft is lower than it actually is, leading to a higher approach. This can cause the pilot to misjudge their altitude as too low and result in a higher approach, potentially overshooting the runway. To counter this illusion, pilots should anticipate the sensation of being too low when flying towards a downsloping runway. They should plan for a shorter landing, aiming to touch down before reaching the end of the runway. During an approach to an upsloping runway, the illusion of being too high is created and the pilot tends to fly lower. To avoid this error, the pilot should keep a higher visual glideslope than normal (he/she should feel higher) in order to fly on the correct actual glideslope. However, a student received the following answer from the authority: \"If your approach angle is meant to be 3, for example, and the runway is already sloping up by 1, you will think you are higher than you actually are and increase the rate of descent and land short. This can be corrected by flying lower at a shallower angle.\"",

This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Rods: They are found in the periphery of retina and they enable scotopic (low-light) vision. The rods can only create black and white images and are also responsible for peripheral vision. 2. Cones: The fovea, at the retina's center, contains only cones that enable photopic (bright-light) vision. The cones are responsible for direct vision and require bright light to function. They are used to detect colours. The cones are located at the center of the retina (fovea area). During daytime the light should focus there in order to receive clear images. Away from the fovea, the clarity of the images produced by the cones reduces rapidly. The cones do not provide peripheral vision capability. This means that in order to see a target clearly during daytime, the target has to be at the center of your field of vision. That is the reason why scanning of the sky is necessary. The recommended scanning technique is to divide the sky in sectors of 10 degrees each, and spend 1 second to scan each segment.",

It does this by controlling the size of the pupil - In low light, your pupils open up, or dilate, to let in more light. When it's bright, they get smaller, or constrict, to let in less light. After passing through the pupil, the light passes through a clear lens. Its shape is changed by the muscles (ciliary muscles) surrounding it which allow the final focusing onto the fovea - In order to focus clearly on a near object, the lens is thickened. To focus on a distant point, the lens is flattened. This focused light is directed onto the retina, a thin layer of light-sensitive nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye. Images are focused at its center (known as the macula) and converted into electrical impulses that are carried to the brain by the optic nerve, where they are translated into sight. The retina is composed of cones ans rods: CONES are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of colour vision and are responsible for high spatial acuity. The central fovea is populated exclusively by cones. RODS are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, being able to detect black and white only. The maximum density of rods is found about 10° from the fovea. Thus making them responsible for our peripheral vision. Rods are also sensitive to movement and the movement of an object to the side of us is quickly picked up.",

When taking off and flying with visual references, it is important to maintain a good view of the horizon, as this is how we set our attitude. In a snowstorm, the visibility can be massively reduced, but also, the human eyes struggle to look through the storm as well, as it is often very bright, and every snowflake is moving around, etc. White-out is more of a term used by helicopter pilots when landing or taking off in snow (or sometimes sand or dust), where they become encircled by the snow and lose visibility very quickly, but it can also be where the visibility drops in heavy snowfall. The only correct option here is that the pilot loses their horizon, and therefore does not know which way is up/down (sky/ground). This would be a major hazard, and is one of the reasons that VFR flight must never be made in IMC. The option about getting lost could be an issue during the flight, but not during take-off, and losing the horizon is a much worse scenario.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity.

The centre of the retina is called the fovea and the receptors in this area are all cones. Moving outwards, the cones become less dense and are gradually replaced by rods - in the periphery there are no cones. CONES. used for direct vision and are colour-sensitive; RODS. the maximum density of rods is found about 10º from the fovea - rods are responsible for our peripheral vision. The rods can only detect black and white but are much more sensitive at lower light levels. As light decreases, the sensing task is passed over from the cones to the rods. => In dim light it is easier to focus on an object if you look slightly away from it. As the fovea contains no rods, which would be required for vision is very low brightness levels, the centre part of the eye becomes blind to dim light. It is then necessary to look away from the visual target so that the peripherally located rods can perform their sensing task. To check the other options given: Peripheral Vision is vision far away from the centre, \"in the corner of your eye\", but is not changed significantly by the darkness adjustment process. Grey-out is a term used when a person is losing blood to their brain and eyes, during a sustained high positive G manouvre, their vision becomes grey, and forms a tunnel. Sensitivity is correct as that is what is changing to allow us to see in darker conditions, the sensitivity of our rods increase during this adjustment period to pick up low light levels, versus the cones which cannot see in the dark, so become less sensitive. Binocular cues are things within our visual range that allow us to judge depth perception, and have nothing to do with night vision adaptation.",

At this point, if you move your head, such as tilting your head down to change a fuel tank or pick up a pen, the fluid in your ears will be moving in an entirely different axis. This makes you feel like the airplane is maneuvering in a way that it isn't, an overwhelming sensation of rotating, turning, or accelerating along an entirely different plane. An attempt to stop the sensation by maneuvering the plane may put it into a dangerous attitude. Coriolis illusion can quickly disorient the pilot and cause dizziness and nausea, as well as complete spatial disorientation. To avoid this illusion, do not move your head too fast in limited visibility or darkness.",

They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher, the Valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

When decompression occurs, nitrogen and other inert gases that are normally dissolved in body tissue and fluid expand to form bubbles that rise out of solution, in the same way that dissolved CO2 appears as bubbles when you uncap a bottle of soda.

These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible.

Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular accelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

All other visual information that is not processed directly through the fovea will be of less detail. An aircraft at a distance of 7 miles which appears in sharp focus within the foveal center of vision would have to be as close as 7/10 of a mile in order to be recognized if it were outside of foveal vision. Because the eyes can focus only on this narrow viewing area, effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field. Each movement should not exceed 10 degrees, and each area should be observed for at least 1 second to enable detection.",

These are typically classified into binocular cues (based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes) and monocular cues (represented in just two dimensions and observed with just one eye). Binocular cues rely on the slight differences in the view seen by each eye to perceive objects. Therefore, binocular perception is only effective when the object is sufficiently close to cause noticeable differences in the viewing angle of both eyes. However, during flight, the distances outside the cockpit are generally vast, rendering binocular cues less useful. Compared to monocular cues, binocular cues operate at a subconscious level. Monocular cues include: Geometric perspective. Motion parallax. Retinal image size. Aerial perspective. An individual with one eye absolutely blind will not receive the binocular depth cues, but will receive the monocular depth cues (cues observed with one eye). Monocular cues will provide the individual with a partial understanding of depth perception.",

Ozone is a gas that is naturally present in our atmosphere. Each ozone molecule contains three atoms of oxygen and is denoted chemically as O3. Ozone is found primarily in two regions of the atmosphere. About 10% of atmospheric ozone is in the troposphere, the region closest to Earth (from the surface up to about 10–16 kilometres[FL320-FL520]). The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude. The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.” The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans, as is also detailed in the Meteorology learning objectives. Usually, for modern transport jets, the higher they climb, the higher the ozone exposure. Even though it is quoted as being hazardous to humans, in reality, the quantities at modern cruising altitudes are not enough to cause any real harm, especially as most aircraft are fitted with ozone filters that will remove the majority of it from the cabin air. This allows us to bring the ozone concentration that is breathed in down below the prescribed limits. The other options are wrong as it is nothing to do with clouds, it is not more concentrated at low levels, and solar flares actually remove ozone from the layer, instead of creating more.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected.

Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. Vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision. \"3. Acceleration\" CORRECT. As g-forces increase, visual effects include loss of colour vision (\"grey-out\"), followed by tunnel vision (where peripheral vision is lost, retaining only the centre vision). If g-forces increase further, complete loss of vision will occur, while consciousness remains. These effects are due to a reduction of blood flow to the eyes. The reverse effect is experienced under negative g-forces, where excess blood moves towards the brain and eyes \"red-out\". \"4. Toxic influence (alcohol, some medication)\" CORRECT. Drug and alcohol use impact the central nervous system. It can affect the way the brain processes images or affect the eye muscles themselves. Excessive drinking can lead to blurred vision and even damage to the optic nerves.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

When breathing 100% oxygen, the partial pressure of oxygen is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at that altitude. The difference between pressurized and non-pressurized aircraft in terms of oxygen partial pressure and altitude stems from how cabin pressure is managed. Pressurized aircraft maintain a higher cabin pressure, simulating a lower altitude (6000 - 8000 ft) up to approximately 35 000 ft, which makes it easier to achieve the MSL oxygen partial pressure at high altitudes. In non-pressurized aircraft, supplemental oxygen becomes necessary at much lower altitudes because the cabin pressure follows the external atmospheric pressure, leading to a lower partial pressure of oxygen. Breathing 100% oxygen at 8000 ft corresponds to the partial pressure of oxygen at MSL. For a pressurized aircraft: 34 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL 38 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 8000 ft 40 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 10 000 ft 45 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 20 000 ft For a non-pressurised aircraft: 8000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL",

Your body will also require more pressure to move this blood around. High blood pressure is also a common cause of heart attack, which are sadly more common for obese individuals. Obesity can lead to diabetes. Individuals with diabetes are said to be two to four times more likely to be at risk for heart disease. It can also lead to high levels of cholesterol. The main risk associated with high cholesterol is coronary heart disease. \"2. Chronic stress\" CORRECT. Your body’s response to stress is supposed to protect you. But, if it's constant, it can harm you. The hormone cortisol is released in response to stress. Studies suggest that the high levels of cortisol from long-term stress can increase blood cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar, and blood pressure. These are common risk factors for heart disease. This stress can also cause changes that promote the buildup of plaque deposits in the arteries. \"3. Low blood pressure\" INCORRECT. Coronary aretery disease are generally associated with high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop coronary artery disease, because high blood pressure puts added force against the artery walls. Over time, this extra pressure can damage the arteries, making them more vulnerable to the narrowing and plaque buildup. \"4. Family history\" CORRECT.

Using 2 eyes for sight is very beneficial, not only does it allow for removal of the blind spot of each eye (caused by the optical nerve), but it also provides us with binocular vision, which allows our brain to interpret depth perception at short to medium distances. Depth perception is the ability to see things in three dimensions (including length, width and depth), and to judge how far away an object is. Depth perception arises from a variety of depth cues. These are typically classified into binocular cues, based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes, and monocular cues, that can be represented in just two dimensions and observed with just one eye. Monocular cues include: relative size (distant objects subtend smaller visual angles than near objects); texture gradient; occlusion and obscuration; linear and aerial/atmospheric perspective; contrast differences; and motion parallax. Therefore, when someone loses their eyesight in a single eye (but the other remains serviceable), they will lose their binocular depth perception cues, but they will still have some depth perception cues, due to monocular cues.",

            "explanation": "This is a really lengthy question with lots of words to try and confuse you. We are currently unsure of the wording, so please let us know if you get this question in your exam and whatever you are able to remember about it, thank you! The question is referring to the coriolis illusion. This is what we feel when our semicircular canals all sense movement at once, which the brain cannot explain. It is quite a bit more complex than this, but for our purposes, it is what happens when a pilot bends down to pick up a pen during a turn. The pilot's vestibular senses have become accustomed to the turn, but when the pilot's head moves and rotates, the equilibrium in all the semicircular canals is disrupted immediately. This leads to dizziness, a tumbling sensation and significant disorientation, particularly if visual reference is lost. The best way to fix these symptoms is to minimise head movements and fixate on the external visual situation or the instruments to allow the brain to understand the situation. Let's go through each option: \"Without any outside visual references, the interaction between their individual senses becomes disturbed by nodding their head while the device is rotating.\" This is correct. \"the interaction between individual senses\" is referring to the different semicircular canals all getting simultaneous angular accelerations at once, which the brain cannot handle. It is important to notice also that this option mentions that nodding the head whilst the device is rotating causes this illusion, and this is because those rotations are occurring around different axes. Just one rotation would quickly get understood by the particular semicircular canal, but when equilibrium has been reached (device spinning), then a different rotation is introduced, all the canals experience new angular accelerations, and without visual reference, the brain gets immediately disorientated. \"The dizziness and disorientation is caused solely by the rotation of the device without external visual reference, the nodding of the head does not influence this effect.\" No. As mentioned above, the head nodding on a different axis to the device spinning causes the illusion, the spinning is not enough on its own. \"The process of interpreting vestibular sensations in the brain's cerebral cortex is adversely affected by the pilot nodding their head, leading to disorientation.\" The process of interpreting vestibular sensations does not occur in the cerebral cortex, and it is not the interpretation that is disrupted, it is the physical movements within the semicircular canals. \"The nodding of the head disturbs the equilibrium of all the sensory inputs. This can be compensated for by the brain for a certain time, after which, disorientation will begin.\" As far as we can tell, the brain cannot \"compensate\" for the coriolis illusion at all, the effects are immediate. We are also unsure about the wording of this option in the real exam, so it may be different than it is here.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

RODS are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, being able to detect black and white only. The maximum density of rods is found about 10° from the fovea. Thus making them responsible for our peripheral vision. Rods are also sensitive to movement and the movement of an object to the side of us is quickly picked up. Rods and cones are the nerve endings of the optic nerve. Thus, as an extension of the brain. Vision is therefore the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL.

The sleeper is in a very light sleep. It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

            "explanation": "ALCOHOL Alcohol is not digested in the body but is absorbed directly into the bloodstream, from the stomach and from the intestines. Once in the blood, it is transported throughout the body. The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour, though this can vary between individuals. One unit is equivalent to about half a pint of beer (0.2 liters), a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirits. On average, alcohol is eliminated from the blood at a rate of approximately 0.015% blood-alcohol concentration per hour. Drinking 1½ pints of beer or three shots of whiskey would raise the blood alcohol level to around 45-50 mg/100 ml, meaning it could take up to four hours for the alcohol to be fully metabolized. The rate of alcohol elimination can vary depending on factors like the type of alcohol consumed (fizzy drinks speed up absorption), body weight, food intake, and individual metabolic differences, with body weight being a particularly significant factor. Let's examine the options given: 'Male pilots can withstand better alcohol effect than female pilots due to an average higher body mass'. INCORRECT. Alcohol tolerance does not depend solely on body mass. Age, physical health, drinking habits and genetics are some other factors that could affect alcohol tolerance. 'Alcohol effects disappears completely when a pilot does not drink alcohol for more than 3 days'. INCORRECT. On average, the body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour. However, the effects of alcohol on the body may not completely disappear after metabolizing it. Factors like individual metabolism, hydration, and overall health play crucial roles in how long alcohol's effects linger. 'An average person of 75 kg will assimilate alcohol with a rate of 0.015% per hour, which is a 0.2 liter beer'. CORRECT. The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour, though this can vary between individuals. One unit is equivalent to about half a pint of beer (0.2 liters), a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirits. On average, alcohol is eliminated from the blood at a rate of approximately 0.015% blood-alcohol concentration per hour. 'No option is correct, everyone can drink as much alcohol as he/she can withstand'. INCORRECT. Alcohol affects judgment, coordination, and reaction times. Drinking large amounts of alcohol, even if someone feels they can \"withstand\" it, can lead to alcohol poisoning.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

Among healthy adults, the average lung capacity is about 4.2 l of air (women) and 6 l (men). However, the volume of air inhaled and exhaled (tidal volume) with each normal breath is only about 500 ml. Beyond the normal tidal volume, the extra amount of air which can be inhaled (Inspiratory Reserve Volume) is about 1900 ml/3000 ml. The Expiratory Reserve Volume is the amount of air that can be still exhaled by forceful expiration after the end of the normal tidal expiration and it is about 700 ml/1100 ml. The air that is always left in the lungs and can never be exhaled, even after the most forceful expiration, is about 1100 ml/1200 ml. Gas exchange takes place in the alveolis in the lungs and the capillaries that envelop them. Inhaled oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries, and carbon dioxide, that was produced by cells as a waste product, moves from the blood in the capillaries to the air in the alveoli to be exhaled. Thus, exhaled air contains more CO2 than inspired air (which contains more O2). This gas exchange is based on the law of diffusion. Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of gases, without the use of any energy or effort by the body, where the gases will move from the area of high pressure into the area of lower pressure. Thus, rate of diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2).",

Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high.

But there are a few things to consider: Aircrews spend much of their flying time at cabin altitudes of 8 000 ft. At these altitudes, substantially less oxygen is available relative to sea level. Since the amount of oxygen passing through a contact lens is directly related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding air (the cornea does not have its own blood supply), the amount of oxygen available under a contact lens will also diminish at higher altitudes. In addition, low cabin humidities may dehydrate soft lenses, inducing a further decrease in oxygen available beneath these lenses by as much as 15 percent. Such reductions in oxygen availability may result in hypoxia with consequent corneal edema and other stresses to ocular physiology.",

            "explanation": "Blind Spot Visual information from the retina is transported to the brain through the optic nerve. This is the point at the back of the eye where all the nerve fibres meet and form the nerve. This section of the retina does not contain photosensitive cells. Light that falls on the retina in this spot cannot be processed into visual impressions, so objects that are projected onto this area cannot be seen. This blind spot is most problematic when vision from the other eye is partially or fully obscured, as that extra eye is usually what would fill in the blank section of vision, hence the reason we do not notice our blind spot in everyday life. If a pilot is looking in one direction with one eye obscured, there is a good chance that they would not see an aircraft on a constant relative bearing (stationary in the windshield) if it happens to lie within the blind spot of the working eye, meaning that the pilot may not be aware of the problem until it has come so close that its depiction is larger than the blind spot – which will most likely be too late to avoid a collision. This could be avoided by using a constant scan, to make sure the blind spot area is not always in the same place. Therefore, in this question, there needs to be both an obscured view (so both eyes cannot see the approaching aircraft), and the aircraft must be in a constant place in the windshield, for the worst case scenario to be realised. The pilot must also have fixed vision (not scanning), as scanning would likely reveal the oncoming aircraft. This leads us to the correct answer.",

You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. The fewer points you have the readier you are to sleep.

(Sleep hours = half the time of being awake) If one has lost 4 h of sleep, he/she will need 4 h of sleep to balance. (Sleep hours missed = sleep hours needed)",

            "explanation": "SMOKING AND HYPOXIA Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

This part of the inner ear is responsible for sound reception. Vestibular Apparatus: The vestibular apparatus is the part of the inner ear responsible for balance-acceleration detection with a purpose to provide to the brain a model of spatial orientation and help it control other systems of the body. The vestibular apparatus consists of the following: Otoliths: The otoliths are tiny chalk-like particles embedded in a soft substance that contains hair cells. The otoliths consist of the utricles chambers that senses linear accelerations and the saccules chambers that sense gravity (vertical acceleration. Semicircular canals: The semicircular canals of the inner ear are three canals filled with fluid that are perpendicular to each other. Inside the canals there are fine hair-like cells which bend during angular accelerations. The superior canal senses acceleration in the pitch axis, the posterior canal measures acceleration in the roll axis and the horizontal canal measures acceleration in the roll axis. Vestibular Apparatus: Otoliths ⇒ Linear acceleration and gravity Semicircular canals ⇒ Angular acceleration (roll, pitch, yaw)",

Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing even if the patient appears to have recovered.",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.

The infection and the reaction of the body cause a swelling of the mucous membranes in the nasopharynx, including the Eustachian tube. This interferes with the process of pressure equalisation. During ascent and descent, gas flows freely out of and into the sinuses. In the presence of inflammation of the lining of these sinuses, as in sinusitis or with a severe head cold, swelling may obstruct the outlets. This will cause pain, which can be severe, during a descent. Furthermore, if one ear equalises but the other doesn't, a form of pressure vertigo may be experienced (i.e. dizziness).",

Hypertension adds to your heart's workload and damages your arteries and organs over time. Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure. Poor lifestyle habits, such as a lack of exercise, can lead to high blood pressure. Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. As a recommendation, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.",

When decompression occurs, nitrogen and other inert gases that are normally dissolved in body tissue and fluid expand to form bubbles that rise out of the solution, in the same way that dissolved CO2 appears as bubbles when you uncap a bottle of soda. These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness. These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. Bends. Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. (This will require the crew to declare a mayday in most cases). The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms.",

The most common causes of conductive deafness are temporary, as the blocking element can be removed. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex.

REM sleep is vital for maintaining emotional stability and a positive mood. Disruptions in sleep patterns that prevent adequate REM sleep can lead to irritability and emotional instability. REM sleep is also known as paradoxical sleep because brain activity during this stage resembles wakefulness (a paradox where the seemingly impossible happens). The body is effectively paralyzed during REM sleep, preventing any physical harm from acting out dreams and fantasies. Non-REM is crucial for physical restoration and tissue repair, particularly after intense physical exertion. During this stage, brain activity is minimal, but the body remains mobile.",

Equally, symptoms of colds, sore throats, diarrhoea and other abdominal upsets may cause little or no problem whilst on the ground but may distract the pilot or cabin crew member and degrade their performance whilst on duty. The in-flight environment may also increase the severity of symptoms which may only be minor whilst on the ground. Therefore, one issue with medication and performing aviation safety related duties is the underlying condition and, in addition, the symptoms may be compounded by the side effects of the medication prescribed or bought over the counter for treatment. The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly? \"2. Flight conditions may modify the reactions of the body to a treatment.\" CORRECT. The lower partial pressure of oxygen, along with the low humidity in an aircraft cabin (increase in water loss), have effects on the body metabolism. Therefore, medication may, for instance, be metabolised slower and accumulate in the blood, causing more severe side effects than on the ground. \"3. The licence holder is prohibited from flying when taking any prescribed medicine.\" INCORRECT. Not all prescribed medicine is incompatible with flying. However, you should seek expert aero-medical advice, especially if you believe that such medication may impair the safe performance of performing aviation safety related duties.",

HEARING LOSS Hearing loss can be broadly separated into two categories: conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss results when there is any problem in delivering sound energy from the sound waves in the ear canal to your cochlea, the hearing part in the inner ear. The natural movement of sound through the external ear or middle ear becomes blocked or dampened in some way, and the full sound does not reach the cochlea. Common reasons for conductive hearing loss are blockages in the outer ear (earwax or other), damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane), damage to (or displacement of) the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), and any other damage or foreign objects that reduce or distort the sound that passes through to the cochlea. The most common causes of conductive deafness are blockages, which can be removed (or will be removed over time with infections), and are therefore temporary. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex. These could be noise induced hearing loss, presbycusis, etc. Note: Cerumen is another term for earwax.",

Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. It is paramount that a person compensates for this very low humidity by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration - thrist is a late symptom of dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration may include headache, feeling dizzy or lightheaded and muscle cramps. Remember that even slight dehydration can cause a reduction in performance.

Proprioceptive sensory inputs give us a reference to posture and the relative position of our body in relation to our environment. A pilot relying on these inputs is sometimes referred to as flying by the “seat-of-the-pants”. Under VMC, the proprioceptive (seat-of-the-pants) sense can be quite helpful. Without ever noticing, we use our proprioceptive sense in everyday life to finetune our movements. In VMC, this sense can give us valuable additional information that can help us finetune our motor actions. But proprioception can only be helpful in combination with vision. Under IMC, the pilot loses vital visual input and the seat-of-pants is no longer able to tell the cause of a sensed pressure and will not provide any valuable data. For instance, if the aircraft goes into a descent it will accelerate and this acceleration, via the otoliths, will inform the pilot that the aircraft is in a climb. The proprioceptors will also detect a climb. Therefore, this system becomes unreliable for lack of visual support and must not be used for spatial orientation. Pilots must rely on the aircraft instruments to avoid disorientation.",

As your heart pumps, it forces blood out through arteries that carry the blood throughout your body. There are two types of blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure refers to the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping; diastolic pressure is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between beats. Blood pressure (BP) is recorded with the systolic number first, followed by the diastolic number. For example, a normal blood pressure would be recorded as something under 120/80 mm Hg.",

Being overweight is one of the common causes of back pain, especially in the lower back. However, this statement is referring to a \"normal weight\". \"2. different length of the lower extremities\" CORRECT. Those who suffer from functional leg length discrepancy are those who tend to suffer from lower back pain. The side that appears shorter often has a “lateral pelvic tilt and a shortening of the lateral flexor muscles.” This sideways pull increases compression on the facet joints for the short side and decreases the space between the vertebra which can lead to pinched nerves (sciatica). \"3. slipped intervertebral disc\" CORRECT. A slipped disc is when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out. It's painful if it presses on nerves. A 'slipped' (prolapsed) disc often causes sudden, severe lower back pain. \"4. muscular tension and fatigue of the back muscles.\" CORRECT. This statement is describing a muscular back pain. A person can treat muscle fatigue and reduce discomfort in the lower back with rest, hot or cold therapy, over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and naproxen and gentle exercises to stretch and loosen tight muscles.",

Auditory illusions are false perceptions of a real sound or outside stimulus.

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide. Carbon Monoxide is produced by incomplete combustion, so wherever there is fire, carbon monoxide will also be present, in some quantity or another. This is why it is particularly possible for Carbon Monoxide to enter the cockpits of light aircraft, which are located so close to aero piston engines, and heated using a heat exchanger with exhaust gasses.",

If you are hyperventilating, you might experience drowsiness, tingling sensation in the fingers and toes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, blurred vision and feelings of suffocation. In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

As a result, the recorded combination of 160/60 is classified as hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) is the force exerted by your blood against your arteries. As your heart pumps, it forces blood out through arteries that carry the blood throughout your body. There are two types of blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure refers to the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping; diastolic pressure is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between beats. Blood pressure (BP) is recorded with the systolic number first, followed by the diastolic number. For example, a normal blood pressure would be recorded as something under 120/80 mm Hg.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

            "explanation": "HYPOXIA Hypoxia is a medical condition where there is a deficiency of oxygen in the tissues and organs of the body. This can occur due to circulatory problems (i.e. anaemia, inadequate blood flow to some body parts), inability of the cells to utilize oxygen (i.e. poisoning) or insufficient oxygen pressure (i.e. exposure to high altitudes). Hypoxia can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, confusion, dizziness, headache, tingling, muscular impairment and visual disturbances. HYPERVENTILATION Hyperventilation is breathing at an abnormally rapid rate, leading to an abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood & changing the body’s acid-base balance. Hyperventilation can be caused due to stress or panic, motion sickness, high temperatures or hypoxia. The symptoms of hyperventilation include nausea, dizziness, tingling, muscular spasms, visual disturbances and feelings of suffocation. GASTROENTERITIS Gastroenteritis occurs due to food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. It is a common cause of illness for pilots. Symptoms appear suddenly and can lead to incapacitation during flight. The symptoms include nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and dehydration. DISENTERY Disentery is an infection transmitted through contaminated food or water. Amoebic dysentery is caused by a parasite called entamoeba histolytica. The symptoms include abdominal pain accompanied by diarrhoea with blood and mucus. In case of severe infection, it can affect the liver and the lungs. Typically, dizziness in not one of the main symptoms of disentery. PHYSICAL EXERTION Physical exertion refers to physical activities or exercise. During normal physical activities, the individual does not suffer from dizziness.",

            "explanation": "“1. regular drinking alone” Correct. There is nothing wrong with the occasional drink by oneself, problems may arise when this becomes a regular habit. Drinking alone is frequently mentioned as one of the common signs of alcoholism. When you start to drink alone on a more frequent basis, solitary drinking can quickly turn into an alcohol dependency or addiction “2. gulping the first drink” Correct. One of the common signs of alcohol use disorder include gulping drinks down in order to feel good. “3. improved memory” Incorrect. Alcohol abuse and addiction can negatively affect a person’s memory. The more a person abuses alcohol, the more likely he or she is to experience memory loss and other cognitive issues. “4. morning shakes” Correct. Alcohol is a depressant, slowing down part of the brain and interfering with mood-regulating chemicals. This means that heavy drinking gets the brain used to a reduced level of stimulation. As alcohol leaves the body of a heavy drinker, the brain is flooded with more activity, the nervous system becomes hyperactive, and you may experience alcohol tremors or shakes. The shakes can happen as quickly as eight hours after your last drink. “5. faster reaction times” Incorrect. Studies have shown that increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is also associated with a decreased reaction time. A blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% is generally associated with a clear loss of reaction time and control. “6. anger if one's drinking habits are criticized” Correct. Signs of a possible drinking problem include having friends or relatives express concern, being annoyed when people criticize your drinking, feeling guilty about your drinking and thinking that you should cut down but finding yourself unable to do so, or needing a morning drink to steady your nerves or relieve a hangover.",

During significant hypoxic stress, alcohol is accompanied by greater levels of oxygen desaturation. Even a small amount of oxygen will result in increased physiological altitude. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide. To cope with this extra demand, your breathing has to increase.

The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. The severity of otic barotrauma depends upon the rate of climb or descent. It occurs mainly at lower levels where pressure changes are the greatest. Normally, crew members may equalize pressure during descent by swallowing or yawing or by tensing the muscles of the throat. If such methods do not work, the Valsalva manoeuvre may be performed (pinch the nostrils, close the mouth, and breath out hard).",

Landing will also be hard in this case, because he/she will possibly flare late and touchdown with a large vertical speed.

He/she might then increase his/her rate of descent and land short of the runway.

Since the amount of oxygen passing through a contact lens is directly related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding air (the cornea does not have its own blood supply), the amount of oxygen available under a contact lens will also diminish at higher altitudes. In addition, low cabin humidities may dehydrate soft lenses, inducing a further decrease in oxygen available beneath these lenses by as much as 15 percent.

The earth's magnetic field deflects most of these particles and, additionally, stratospheric absorption gives considerable protection in equatorial regions but this effect declines to zero as the polar regions are approached. The effects of Galactic radiation increase with altitude. Solar Radiation / Solar Flares. This type of radiation is emitted by The Sun, and is variable based on \"solar flares\", which are also called solar storms, and are random, creating more solar radiation. It is quite similar to Galactic radiation in where it is highest, how it is absorbed, etc. One of the two other types of radiation mentioned are man-made sources, which consist of thinks like Nuclear power, weaponry, household items (Granite countertops, strangely) and more. Of course these are going to be low effect at high altitude, so that is why we think EASA are not including them in the correct answer. The other is \"naturally occurring elements\", which are exactly as they sound, elements such as uranium or plutonium, just to name 2, that exist naturally in the ground. Of course, the effect of these is going to be very low at high altitudes too, hence the reason they are not in the correct answer. Galactic radiation and solar flares are mostly absorbed by the Earth's magnetic field and the upper atmosphere, but at high latitudes and at high altitudes, they can be present in high amounts that affect flight crew quite significantly over the course of a career.",

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (radial/angular acceleration). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity.

However, if nitrogen comes out of solution in the form of small bubbles, it can lead to severe issues. This can be likened to the formation of bubbles in carbonated beverages when the bottle is opened and pressure decreases. If nitrogen bubbles form in the blood within the human body, it directly leads to a condition called Decompression Sickness (DCS). Exposure of the body to reduced pressure can result in DCS. When there is a sudden decrease in ambient pressure, some of the nitrogen comes, out of solution as bubbles. Ascending to cabin altitudes above 18,000 feet is commonly associated with DCS. In severe cases, individuals may experience collapse, and DCS may persist even after descending, potentially leading to death. Factors such as hypoxia, cold temperatures, age, and excess body mass/obesity increase the risk of DCS. DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS The bends: The main symptoms of DCS include joint pain known as \"the bends,\" primarily affecting the shoulders, wrists, knees, and ankles. The affected joints may worsen with movement or rubbing, but descending to lower altitudes usually resolves the issue. The creeps: The release of nitrogen bubbles under the skin causes a sensation known as \"the creeps,\" where the sufferer feels as though a compact colony of ants is crawling over or just beneath the skin. The chokes: In the respiratory system, DCS can lead to \"the chokes\" as nitrogen bubbles may block pulmonary blood flow by getting trapped in the lungs' capillaries. This results in severe shortness of breath accompanied by a burning, gnawing, and sometimes piercing pain. The staggers: The bubbles also impact the blood supply to the brain and the nervous system, leading to \"the staggers.\" This causes a loss of certain mental functions and impaired control of movement. In extreme cases, chronic paralysis or permanent mental disturbances may occur.",

HEARING LOSS Hearing loss can be broadly separated into two categories: conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss results when there is any problem in delivering sound energy from the sound waves in the ear canal to your cochlea, the hearing part in the inner ear. The natural movement of sound through the external ear or middle ear becomes blocked or dampened in some way, and the full sound does not reach the cochlea. Common reasons for conductive hearing loss are blockages in the outer ear (earwax or other), damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane), damage to (or displacement of) the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), and any other damage or foreign objects that reduce or distort the sound that passes through to the cochlea. The most common causes of conductive deafness are blockages, which can be removed (or will be removed over time with infections), and are therefore temporary. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex. These could be noise induced hearing loss, presbycusis, etc.",

            "explanation": "CONES AND RODS The cones are responsible for all color vision, from appreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle shades in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout the retina, but are concentrated toward the center of the field of vision at the back of the retina. There is a small pit called the fovea where almost all the light sensing cells are cones. This is the area where most “looking” occurs (the center of the visual field where detail, color sensitivity, and resolution are highest). While the cones and their associated nerves are well suited to detecting fine detail and color in high light levels, the rods are better able to detect movement and provide vision in dim light. The rods are unable to discern color but are very sensitive at low light levels. The trouble with rods is that a large amount of light overwhelms them, and they take a long time to “reset” and adapt to the dark again. There are so many cones in the fovea that the very center of the visual field hardly has virtually no rods at all. So in low light, the middle of the visual field is not very sensitive, but farther from the fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide the major portion of night vision.",

Both are refractive errors, or abnormalities of the eye that affect its ability to focus light on the retina. The medical term for short-sightedness is myopia. This occurs when light entering the eye does not focus properly on the retina, the membrane that lines the back of the eyeball. The eyeball is longer than normal and the image forms in front of the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry. Close-up vision, on the other hand, is not affected. Long-sightedness is somewhat the opposite of short sightedness. It usually is caused by an eyeball that's too short, which causes light to come to a focus behind the retina instead of directly on it.",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Nonetheless, the recent feedback indicated its presence in HPL, likely due to it's loose relation to visual processing and sight. The feedback was not too clear on the exact wording though, so please let us know if you see this in the exam, and whatever wording you can remember from the real question, thank you! Let's go through each option. \"Ground features that are located on nearby slopes within a valley will pass the aircraft quickly, and could be missed.\" This is correct. Flying down valleys at low level means that you are much closer to the ground (and particularly the slopes on either side) than most pilots will be accustomed to from standard flying. This feels a lot faster, due to the local terrain going past the aircraft at a visually faster rate. This is an illusion of course, as we are just closer to the terrain, we are not actually travelling any faster. Nonetheless, it leaves a lot less time for visual navigation features to be identified, so they could be missed. \"It is very hard to spot visual features on sloping ground.\" Not really; it obviously depends on the ground and the feature, but it is not inherently more difficult to spot features on sloping ground than flat ground. \"There are usually no suitable visual features for navigation in mountainous regions.\" Certainly not. Mountainous regions are often rich with features for visual navigation, both natural and man-made. The shape of the mountains themselves are often very useful for navigating around. \"Around midday, the direct sunlight will make seeing ground features very difficult.\" Incorrect, the direct sunlight should make things easier to see usually around midday. In the early morning or afternoon, the mountains may obscure The Sun from shining on some of the slopes, and this could be difficult for navigation, but not at midday.",

Many different factors can cause this state of oxygen deficiency. Hypoxia is actually divided into four types: hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, stagnant hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia. HYPEMIC HYPOXIA This type of hypoxia is caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. To the pilot, this means that, even though there is an adequate supply of oxygen to breathe, the blood's capacity to carry the oxygen to the cells has been impaired. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen. For instance, anemia, hemorrhage, hemoglobin abnormalities, and carbon monoxide interfere with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen the blood can carry to the cells. The most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen.",

Symptoms can include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting. Some of the causes of gastroenteritis include viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxins, parasites, particular chemicals and some drugs. Gastroenteritis is the commonest cause of pilot incapacitation whilst on duty. A study of over 5000 airline pilots discovered that 29% had at least one episode of incapacitation due to uncontrolled bowel actions. Gastroenteritis is, therefore, a threat to flight safety. \"Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways of preventing infection\" Correct. Hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infections. You can spread certain \"germs\" (a general term for pathogens like viruses and bacteria) casually by touching another person. You can also catch germs when you touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then you touch your face (mouth, eyes, and nose). \"3. Liquid intake should be reduced when suffering from gastroenteritis.\" Incorrect. The body is likely to lose a lot of water from diarrhoea. Therefore, when suffering from gastroenteritis, it is important to drink sufficient amount of water.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time which can be classified as acoustic trauma. Cabin noise settles at around 80 to 85 dB during cruise, which is sufficient to cause NIHL. Note: Noise is not a direct cause to conductive hearing loss.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate. THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid. Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time which can be classified as acoustic trauma. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears. In this question the problem is Barotrauma of the middle ear and it asks for the technique how to overcome it and the only way to do so is to allow for reduction of the pressure gradient via the tympanic membrane. The only provided option to achieve this is to stop descent and, if this is not sufficient, climb again to reduce outside air pressure.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration.

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Thereafter, body temperature tends to rise until late afternoon or early evening, at which point it starts a decline that continues until it reaches its low point in the early morning hours. The circadian variation in body temperature is virtually the same for active and non-active individuals.

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

The hormone called insulin is responsible for breaking down glucose (sugar) and insulin is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin at all (Type 1) or when the insulin produced does not work properly (Type 2). There are two main types of Diabetes: Type I. This happens when there is no insulin to break down sugar. It typically occurs in younger persons. The risk of developing this type of diabetes is usually related to one’s genes and ethnicity, which are factors that cannot be controlled Type II. This happens when the insulin produced by the pancreas does not work properly. It typically occurs in persons over the age of 40. The risk of developing this type of diabetes increases with a lack of regular exercise, weight gain and a poor diet amongst other factors such as genetics. Up to 80 per cent of cases of Type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by making simple changes in one’s lifestyle including adopting a healthy diet, undertaking regular exercise and controlling one’s weight.",

If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration.

The body can only cope with certain amount of G-force and tolerance to G forces is dependent on human physiology and the individual pilot. The physiological effects of G-force vary with the magnitude of acceleration, its duration and onset rate, the axis of the body upon which the G acts against and where on the body they are applied. Onset rate: when an acceleration sets on gradually, the body is capable of partially compensate for its effect, by vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure. However, when acceleration sets on rapidly, the body mechanisms for compensation will not be as effective. Thus acceleration will have a greater effect.",

            "explanation": "CARBON MONOXIDE Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gas. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

This effect is prevalent during high accelerations/deccelerations and it is the tendency – in the absence of visual references – to incorrectly perceive acceleration as an increase in pitch attitude and deceleration as a decrease in pitch attitude. This occurs because, for instance, during a sudden forward linear acceleration, the otoliths are moved backwards. This will give the signals to the brain that the head is tilting backwards. Thus the pilot feel that he/she is climbing. The pilot’s response to this illusion would be to push the yolk or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down.

The body’s circadian rhythms control the sleep-wake cycle. They play a role in sleep due to how the body and brain respond to darkness, which is when most humans feel tired and tend to sleep. As darkness sets in, the body’s biological clock instructs the cells to slow down. When the evening becomes dark, the hormone melatonin starts to rise and allows sleep to occur. Melatonin peaks around 2–4 A. M. and then reduces by morning, allowing wakefulness. There is also a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

            "explanation": "Spatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement of the airplane in space. The body uses three integrated systems working together to ascertain orientation and movement in space. • Vestibular system—organs found in the inner ear that sense position by the way we are balanced. • Somatosensory system—nerves in the skin, muscles, and joints, which, along with hearing, sense position based on gravity, feeling, and sound. • Visual system—eyes, which sense position based on what is seen. All this information comes together in the brain and, most of the time, the three streams of information agree, giving a clear idea of where and how the body is moving. Flying can sometimes cause these systems to supply conflicting information to the brain, which can lead to disorientation. During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), the eyes are the major orientation source and usually prevail over false sensations from other sensory systems. When these visual cues are removed, as they are in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), false sensations can cause a pilot to quickly become disoriented. Approaching over still water at night - with few external cues (other than runway lights) may lead to glidepath overestimation.",

Continue the approach and hope for the best (Incorrect): Continuing the approach without clear guidance or situational awareness is unsafe. \"Hoping for the best\" is not a professional or reliable strategy in aviation. It can lead to misalignment with the runway, potential collision with obstacles, or an unsafe landing. Ask ATC for vectors and prepare in case of a missed approach (Correct): This is the correct course of action. ATC can provide accurate guidance (heading instructions) to ensure you are correctly aligned with the runway. Preparing for a missed approach ensures you are ready to take corrective action if necessary. Try to visually locate the runway without contacting ATC (Incorrect): While it might be possible to locate the runway visually, relying solely on visual navigation when you are already confused can be risky. Not contacting ATC means missing out on their guidance and support, which is crucial in ensuring a safe approach. This could lead to further confusion or errors in judgment. Perform an immediate go-around without informing ATC: Performing a go-around is a viable option if you are unsure of your position, but it must be done while informing ATC. Not informing ATC can create a safety hazard, as ATC needs to know your intentions to manage air traffic and prevent conflicts with other aircraft. Communication with ATC ensures that they can provide instructions for a safe go-around and re-approach.",

Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. When the pilot realizes that he has just escaped a mid-air collision, he experiences symptoms of initial stress reaction: \"fight or flight\" response. The perception of threat activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body to fight or flee but may be experienced as uncomfortable when you do not know why they are happening. During the \"Fight or Flight\" response, your heart beats faster. A faster heart beat feeds more blood to the muscles and enhances your ability to run away or fight. Breathing becomes quicker and shallower. Quicker breathing takes in more oxygen to power the muscles. This makes the body more able to fight or run away.",

If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.03.03.01: State the role of the Eustachian tube in equalising pressure between the middle ear and the environment. Ear pain during descent is most often caused by the difference in air pressure between the cabin and a person's middle ear. The middle ear is a closed off environment, which is sealed off by the eustachian tube. As the aircraft climbs and descends (but the worst direction is descent, due to the way the eustachian tube opens outwards), the ear has more or less pressure inside than the ambient air, which feels like a dull pain within the ear, and sound becomes a little muffled. The eustachian tube can be opened by making large movements with the jaw, or by the action of swallowing. This will then equalise the middle ear pressure with that of the ambient air, removing the pain. This often occurs naturally when talking or eating, but is easy to induce manually. Another way of equalising pressure is the Valsalva manoeuvre (pinching the nose and blowing out through it), but this can be a bit harsher. People suffering from a cold or ear infection may struggle to equalise their ears at all due to a blocked eustachian tube, so may feel some discomfort for a while. Usually, this should clear over a few minutes/hours, but in extreme cases, could cause damage the eardrum due to the difference in pressure. This is very rare indeed, and unlikely to occur, especially when pain only begins on the approach. The problem is also that the aircraft has to land anyway, so cannot stop the descent, and it is not bad enough in this scenario to require a mayday call and emergency ambulance, so this is all the cabin crew can do to help.

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

The in-flight environment may also increase the severity of symptoms which may only be minor whilst on the ground. Therefore, one issue with medication and performing aviation safety related duties is the underlying condition and, in addition, the symptoms may be compounded by the side effects of the medication prescribed or bought over the counter for treatment. The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly? \"2. Conditions in flight may alter the body’s reaction to medication.\" CORRECT. The lower partial pressure of oxygen, along with the low humidity in an aircraft cabin (increase in water loss), have effects on the body metabolism. Therefore, medication may, for instance, be metabolised slower and accumulate in the blood, causing more severe side effects than on the ground. \"Flying under medication is prohibited by law.\" INCORRECT. Flying under medication, such as sedatives or antidepressants, may be completely prohibited by law but this is not a general rules and there are many medicines which can be taken by flight crew.",

            "explanation": "\"1. Hyperventilation\" CORRECT. Simply, hyperventilation is overbreathing. One of the symptoms of hyperventilation are visual disturbances - blurred, tunnelling and clouding vision. \"2. Hypoxia\" CORRECT. Hypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough oxygen.” Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. \"3. Hypertension\" If prolonged and severe enough, hypertension can cause visual disturbances. Compared to visual disturbances caused by hypoxia, fatigue or hyperventilation, the ones caused by hypertension are more of a long term character. It is possible that EASA meant visual disturbances of short term character, but we really don't know. If you encounter this question on your exam, we would advise you to contest it. \"4. Fatigue\" CORRECT. To be able to keep tracking a moving object, the eyes need to act in harmony with one another which means coordinated control of the muscles of the two eyes by the brain. In a fatigued person, this coordination sometimes fails and the result is that quite differing images are transmitted from each eye. Subsequently double vision occurs.",

Bacterial gastroenteritis happens when bacteria cause an infection in your gut. The infection leads to inflammation in your stomach and intestines. While viruses cause many gastrointestinal infections, bacterial infections are also common. Some people call these infections food poisoning. Moreover, flying to a number of different countries may cause the pilot to eat food that he/she is not used to. For example, in some countries, it is common to consume very spicy food. For those who are not used to, the consumption of spicy foods can trigger upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as indigestion. Drinking alcohol is associated with acid rising up from your stomach into your throat (known as acid reflux), or causing heartburn. Some evidence suggests alcoholic drinks can make your stomach produce more acid than usual, which can gradually wear away your stomach lining and make it inflamed and painful (gastritis).

The vestibular system, located in the inner ear, consists of the vestibule and three semicircular canals. The utricle and saccule organs are within the vestibule, and are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense angular accelerations in yaw, pitch and roll. This question mentions the \"anterior\" semicircular canal, which is also called the superior canal, and is the one which senses pitch (nodding ones head is felt by this canal). The exact canals and their names are above the syllabus, though, which does not stop you answering this question. They are extremely sensitive, and can be prone to errors such as \"the leans\", due to the way that they work, with fluid inside the canals that moves sensory hairs to detect the different accelerations. A common error is when a pilot has been turning for a while, and rolls out of the turn, their vestibular system has reset slightly in the turn, and now believes that they have banked the opposite direction, instead of being straight and level. The other options all exist within the ear, but are parts of the auditory system, which allows us to hear sounds. The ossicles are made up of the malleus, incus and stapes. Although both the vestibular system and the auditory system exist within the ear, they try and stay as isolated from each other as possible, although extremely loud noises can vibrate the vestibular apparatus, giving balance problems.",

The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Yellow, amber, and orange tints are not recommended as they eliminate short-wavelength light from reaching the wearer’s eyes and reportedly sharpen vision. In addition, these tints are known to distort colors, making it difficult to distinguish the color of navigation lights, signals, or color-coded maps and instrument displays. PHOTOCHROMIC. (automatically tinting glasses) These lenses react with UV radiation by darkening. As the cockpit windshield is designed to block the transmission of UV light, these lenses will not work as effectively in the cockpit environment. The use of these sunglasses is therefore discouraged. For flying, sunglass lenses should screen out only 70 - 85% of visible light and not appreciably distort color. Tints that block more than 85% of visible light are not recommended for flying due to the possibility of reduced visual acuity, resulting in difficulty seeing instruments and written material inside the cockpit.",

The leans/somatogyral illusion occur when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. If you make such a recovery, your semicircular canals sense a roll in the opposite direction. This may cause you to reenter the original attitude. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans. Note: Sensory adaptation is a reduction in sensitivity to a stimulus after constant exposure to it.",

These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness. These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. Bends. Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing even if the patient appears to have recovered.",

Although the symptoms are similar, vertigo is different from Coriolis illusion. Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. This question really asks for the Coriolis illusion. CORIOLIS ILLUSION Coriolis illusion happens when you're in a constant turn long enough for the fluid in your ears to stop moving. When the fluid in your ears stops moving, your brain thinks it is 'straight-and-level'. At this point, if you move your head too quickly, such as tilting your head down to change a fuel tank or pick up a pen, you can start the fluid in your ears moving in an entirely different axis. This makes you feel like the airplane is maneuvering in a way that it isn't, an overwhelming sensation of rotating, turning, or accelerating along an entirely different plane. An attempt to stop the sensation by maneuvering the plane may put it into a dangerous attitude. To avoid this illusion, do not move your head too fast in limited visibility or darkness.",

Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. When the pilot realizes that he has just escaped a mid-air collision, he experiences symptoms of initial stress reaction: \"fight or flight\" response. The perception of threat activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body to fight or flee but may be experienced as uncomfortable when you do not know why they are happening. During the \"Fight or Flight\" response, your heart beats faster. A faster heart beat feeds more blood to the muscles and enhances your ability to run away or fight. Breathing becomes quicker and shallower. Quicker breathing takes in more oxygen to power the muscles. This makes the body more able to fight or run away.",

The leans/somatogyral illusion occurs when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans. This kind of illusion can happen during VFR flight and the only remedy is to trust your instruments.",

Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen. \"2. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurisation and supplemental oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"3. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolise oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to histotoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histotoxic hypoxia. \"4. Blood pooling in the lower extremities due to inertia (+Gz).\" CORRECT. This statement refers to ischemic/stagnant hypoxia - Reduced brain oxygen is caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain. This can occur as a result of positive accelerations (+Gz) - lack of blood in the upper body parts because it is pulled down by gravity.",

The in-flight environment may also increase the severity of symptoms which may only be minor whilst on the ground. Therefore, it’s important to help improve awareness of the specific challenges of the use of medication in aviation. The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly?",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

            "explanation": "Sleep Regulation. How we sleep is regulated by two internal biological mechanisms. These two systems work together to regulate when we are awake and when we sleep. Sleep is regulated by two independent, yet interrelated processes. These two processes are: Homeostatic Sleep Drive Circadian Rhythm - Your circadian rhythm helps control your daily schedule for sleep and wakefulness. These processes play a role in sleep regulation with regards to: sleep timing sleep intensity sleep duration Elevated Sleep Drive. Pressure for sleep builds up in our body as our time awake increases. The pressure gets stronger the longer we stay awake and decreases during sleep, reaching a low after a full night of good-quality sleep. The homeostatic process begins to build again after we awaken. Homeostatic sleep drive - refers to the \"normal\" sleep drive, your usual, optimum, daily (or nightly) sleep drive. Whereas ELEVATED sleep drive => makes you more driven to sleep at times you wouldn't usually. Sleep Desynchronisation. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization between internal sleep-wake rhythms and the light-darkness cycle. Patients typically have insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or both, which typically resolve as the body clock realigns itself. Desynchronisation may result in symptoms such as sleep alteration, persistent fatigue, sleep medication dependence, and mood disturbances, including depression. Sleep inertia. Refers to the transitional state between sleep and wake, marked by impaired performance, reduced vigilance, and a desire to return to sleep. The intensity and duration of sleep inertia vary based on situational factors, but its effects may last minutes to several hours.",

Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure.

Fume events – abnormal odours, smoke, haze or fumes in the cabin – may arise from various internal or external sources, and some are due to contamination of the bleed air supply, for example as a result of a failure of an oil seal in the engine. In recent years concerns have been expressed about possible adverse health effects of exposure to contaminants in cabin air. More specifically, the term “fume event” is used to refer to a potentially toxic environment created by contaminated bleed air used to pressurize and ventilate aircraft cockpit and cabins. An oil spill in front of the landing gear may indicate a leak in the hydraulic system. This is hazardous as some of the fluid may enter the Bleed Air system, which may lead to a fume event. Purple trails of fluid from gaps in the wing or tail surfaces may indicate a leak in the hydraulic system. However, it is unlikely that, in this locations, the hydraulic fluid will contaminate the Bleed Air system. Black stain around the engine exhaust pipe is just water mixed with carbon in the exhaust pipe. Water usually comes out when the engine is not hot enough (i.e. when starting it). So the liquid water drips out of exhaust with the carbon mixed in it making it black.",

However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular acelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Internal Respiration: Internal respiration refers to the gas exchange between the blood capillaries and the tissue fluid around the cell. Oxygen diffuses out from the blood into tissue/cells during internal respiration. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood from the tissue during internal respiration. External Respiration: External respiration refers to the gas exchange between the alveoli and blood capillaries of the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into the blood during external respiration. Carbon dioxide (by product - cells waste) diffuses out from the blood into the alveolar air during external respiration. The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate. If the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is too high, you will breth faster and deeper to eliminate CO2.",

Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control. Body feedback will be wrong and only by reference to the aircraft instruments can safe control of the aircraft be maintained.",

Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later.

Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body breaks down sugars (glucose) and starches. Glucose is a vital source of energy for human cells and tissues, and its levels in the bloodstream need to be carefully controlled. This control is primarily managed by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes is categorised as type 1 and 2. Type 1 Diabetes This type is usually diagnosed in children and young adults but can occur at any age. In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As a result, the body doesn't produce insulin, and individuals with Type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump to regulate their blood sugar levels. Type 2 Diabetes This type usually effects adults. This is the most common form of diabetes and is often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity and lack of physical activity. In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas may not produce enough insulin or the body is unable to effectively use the insulin (insulin resistant). Treatment may involve lifestyle changes, oral medications and in some cases insulin therapy. EASA AIR CREW MED. B.025 Metabolic and Endocrine Systems (a) Applicants with metabolic, nutritional or endocrine dysfunction may be assessed as fit subject to demonstrated stability of the medical condition and satisfactory aero-medical evaluation. (b) Diabetes mellitus (1) Applicants with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit. (2) Applicants with diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit unless it can be demonstrated that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. (c) Aero-medical assessment (1) Applicants for a class 1 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be referred to the medical assessor of the licensing authority. (2) The fitness of applicants for a class 2 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be assessed in consultation with the medical assessor of the licensing authority. Diabetes Type 2 usually affects adults and it may not require insulin treatment. A pilot will be assessed as unfit to fly if it cannot be demonstrated that his/her blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. If it can be demonstrated that his/her blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable, the pilot will be assessed as fit to fly.

For comfort, human beings require a relative humidity of 40% to 60%, which corresponds to the normal humidity of the atmosphere. The humidity of the air in pressurised aircraft is typically only 5 to 15 %. Such difference results from the air conditioning system of modern aircraft drawing air from outside the aircraft - At airline operating altitudes, the air is very cold and can only hold very little amount of water vapour. Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. Newer aircraft built for passenger comfort have actually begun to add humidifiers to reduce this effect, but they are heavy to carry around. This very low humidity (very dry environment) should be compensated by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration, using eye drops and aqueous creams. A water based moisturizer is best for those with dehydrated skin that is in need of moisture, and oily moisturisers are not as good for this.",

This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision; Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.01.03.04: List the factors that affect the relative humidity of both the atmosphere and cabin air. Note: This question does mention humidity, but from the learning objectives, general understanding and other similar questions, we strongly believe that the examiner is referring to relative humidity in this question, a much more commonly used metric. Also, if they were referring to absolute humidity, only the outside air temperature would make a difference (within normal temperature ranges), which would make two answers equally correct. Relative humidity is a measure of how much water vapour is in the air as a percentage of how much water vapour the air can hold in total. Warm air can hold more water vapour than colder air, therefore, for the same amount of water, the relative humidity in warm air is lower. This means that the lowest relative humidity in the cabin will occur when the cabin is warm. In the same way, to have the lowest relative humidity in the cabin, there has to be a small amount of water in the air. The way to do this is to have a cold outside air temperature, because that causes the outside air to hold less water in the first place. Especially if the aircraft was flying through a cloud, which has 100% relative humidity, there would be less water in the air if the air was colder. This means that we require a very cold temperature outside and high temperature inside the cabin to get the lowest relative humidity. This is a practical subject for human performance and limitations as humidity is often very low on aircraft, which causes dryness effects, that need to be counteracted sometimes. In the past, humidifiers were removed from many aircraft for weight saving, making the relative humidity as low as 3-5% in some cases.",

We believe that this question could be asking about visual illusions. If you see a mountain, but do not check how big it is, then illusions can creep into your visual processing, and you might begin to believe you are an acceptable distance from it, when actually, you are much too low, or too close to the mountainside. It is a difficult question as it does not really specify what visual illusions we might expect whilst flying through valleys etc., and it is difficult to choose one based on this question wording alone. The other option is that the question is talking about the psychology/behaviour of the pilot. Not planning ahead, not keeping a good situational awareness, etc. When doing valley flying (low-level mountain flying), not being aware of the local terrain can be deadly, as you can get stuck in a tight valley (no turn around option) with rising terrain, and possibly even a downdraft wind, meaning that the aircraft's climb gradient may not be sufficient to outclimb the terrain. We can't quite tell what is being asked, but thankfully, the other options are incorrect. Judging speed should not really be an issue, it won't lead to close encounters with aircraft, and unless the aircraft is planning to land with very little fuel, the groundspeed is not a major hazard (as long as the airspeed is fine, of course). The question has not mentioned anything about haze, mist, any other visual obscurations, so atmospheric perspective is unlikely to be an issue.",

Two pathways come from the heart: The pulmonary circulation is a short loop from the heart to the lungs and back again. The systemic circulation carries blood from the heart to all the other parts of the body and back again. Deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a big artery that comes from the heart and brings blood from the heart to the lungs. At the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. The blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Next, blood that returns to the heart has picked up lots of oxygen from the lungs. So it can now go out to the body. The aorta is a big artery that leaves the heart carrying this oxygenated blood.",

This disturbance of the acid balance has a number of effects, the major one being that haemoglobin gives up its oxygen readily only in an acid medium. As a result, tissues suffer from lack of O2. Some causes of sudden hyperventilation include anxiety, fever, some medicines, intense exercise, and emotional stress. \"Poor saturation of oxygen\" Incorrect. Blood oxygen saturation can even be 100%, however this oxygen will not be of much use to the tissues because it is bonded to the haemoglobin more firmly than in an acidic medium and can only diffuse into the tissues very pooorly.",

While adding to the mystique of an aviator, sunglasses protect a pilot’s eyes from glare associated with bright sunlight and the harmful effects from exposure to solar radiation. The choice of tints for use in the aviation environment should be limited to those that optimize visual performance while minimizing color distortion, such as a neutral gray tint with 15 - 30% light transmittance.

As a result, conditions like carbon monoxide poisoning and even smoking can lead to this type of hypoxia. \"It results from a blood flow reduction through the tissues.\" ⇒ This describes Ischaemic hypoxia, which may be caused by, for example, obstruction of arterial supply by disease or trauma. \"It results from an interference with the tissues ability to utlize a normal oxygen supply for oxidative processes.\" ⇒ This describes Histotoxic hyoxia, which may be cause by certain biochemical disorders or poisoning resulting from, for instance, drug misuse, chronic alcohol abuse, poison.",

It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal sleep is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase. => During any normal night’s sleep, the pattern operates on an approximately 90 minutes cycle. Towards the end of the first 90 minutes od falling asleep, the first REM stage occurs, but this first REM experience lasts only 10 to 20 minutes before the person passes back into slow wave sleep. At the end of the second cycle of 90 min, the duration of REM sleep periods increases. During a 8 hour sleep period, an individual is likely to experience 4 to 5 REM sleep episodes.",

EASA distinguishes three physiological thresholds: Reaction threshold. The altitude of 7 000 ft is referred to as the reaction threshold. It is the altitude at which even a healthy person may start to experience symptoms of hypoxia. Above this limit, the body reacts to the decreasing oxygen supply by increasing the rate and depth of breathing as well as the stroke volume to ensure full performance. Disturbance threshold. The altitude band of 10 000 to 12 000 ft is called the disturbance threshold, because the compensatory mechanisms of the body are not powerful enoughto ensure full operation. Performance will be reduced and flight safety may be impaired. Critical threshold. The altitude of 22 000 ft is referred to as the critical threshold. The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is reduced to equal the minimum required blood partial pressure, no diffusion of oxygen into the blookd will be possible.",

They act outwards from the centre of rotation and are experienced whenever an aircraft changes direction (predominantly +Gz). This type of acceleration is the most significant to pilots. During radial accelerations, fluid and tissues are displaced downwards. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms.",

The centre of the retina is called the fovea and the receptors in this area are all cones. Moving outwards, the cones become less dense and are gradually replaced by rods - in the periphery there are no cones. CONES. used for direct vision and are colour-sensitive; RODS. the maximum density of rods is found about 10º from the fovea - rods are responsible for our peripheral vision. The rods can only detect black and white but are much more sensitive at lower llight levels. As light decreases, the sensing task is passed over from the cones to the rods. => In dim light it is easier to focus on an object if you look slightly away from it. As the fovea contains no rods, which would be required for vision is very low brightness levels, the centre part of the eye becomes blind to dim light. It is then necessary to look away from the visual target so that the peripherally located rods can perform their sensing task.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

Pilot eye height from the ground may be the source of misjudged speed. Pilots converting to an aircraft with an eye position that is higher than on their previous type will have their normal visual references at a greater distance, which will give the illusion of slower relative motion, and in the initial stages of training they may well taxi at excessive speeds as a result.

Yellow, amber, and orange tints are not recommended as they eliminate short-wavelength light from reaching the wearer’s eyes and reportedly sharpen vision. In addition, these tints are known to distort colors, making it difficult to distinguish the color of navigation lights, signals, or color-coded maps and instrument displays. PHOTOCHROMIC. (automatically tinting glasses) These lenses react with UV radiation by darkening. As the cockpit windshield is designed to block the transmission of UV light, these lenses will not work as effectively in the cockpit environment. The use of these sunglasses is therefore discouraged. For flying, sunglass lenses should screen out only 70 - 85% of visible light and not appreciably distort color. Tints that block more than 85% of visible light are not recommended for flying due to the possibility of reduced visual acuity, resulting in difficulty seeing instruments and written material inside the cockpit.",

            ],
            "explanation": "\"1. Nicotine increases the risk of lung cancer.\" Incorrect. Nicotine is the addictive chemical in cigarettes but it is the tar that is responsible for the biggest health risks, including many types of cancer. \"2. Smoking increases the physiological altitude by about 1 000 to 3 000 ft compared to non-smokers.\" Incorrect. Smoking cigarettes reduces the capability of the blood to carry oxygen because haemoglobin has a greater affinity for carbon monoxide than it has for oxygen => which results in an increase in physiological altitude. However, it is not possible to say by how much. \"3. Abstinence from tobacco can cause irritability and limited ability to concentrate in regular smokers.\" Correct. The withdrawal from cigarette smoking can be acutely unpleasant, to be sure. In a report on the withdrawal experiences of self-quitters, many unpleasant feelings and symptoms - such as irritability, concentration issues, cravings, and weight gain increased when the person quit were reported. \"4. Smokers have an increased risk to suffer from myocardial infarction and stroke.\" Correct. Smokers not only have increased risk of lung disease, including lung cancer and emphysema, but also have increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and oral cancer. \"5. Cancer of the urinary tract is more often found with smokers.\" Correct. A study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that 50% of all cases of bladder cancer are found in smokers. Former smokers are twice as likely to develop the disease as those who never smoked; current smokers are four times more likely. Correct option: 3, 4, 5",

From 34 000 ft to 40 000 ft, pilots must breathe 100% oxygen. Without pressurization, sufficient oxygen can be delivered up to an altitude of about 40 000 ft (12 000 m). At 40 000 ft, the ambient air pressure falls to about 0.2 bar, at which maintaining a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 bar requires breathing 100% oxygen under positive pressure. 34 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL 38 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 8 000 ft 40 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 10 000 ft 45 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 20 000 ft => Above 40 000 ft, breathing 100% oxygen without pressure is not sufficient.

Hypoxia is a condition characterized by an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body's tissues Three of the four statements include aviation examples for four forms of hypoxia: \"2. A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen. \"3. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurisation and supplemental oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"4. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolise oxygen.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to histotoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histotoxic hypoxia.",

This rapid decompression causes nitrogen and other inert gases, which are normally dissolved in body tissues and fluids, to form bubbles. This process is similar to how bubbles appear in a soda when it's opened. The bubbles can cause various symptoms, including pain in major joints like the elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees, and ankles, as well as more severe effects such as seizures and loss of consciousness. The severity of these symptoms depends on how quickly and how much the pressure changes. In extreme cases, DCS can be fatal. Symptoms Bends. Bubbles in the joints cause rheumatic-like pain. Movement or rubbing the affected areas worsens the pain, but descending usually alleviates the issue. This is the most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. (This will require the crew to declare a mayday in most cases). The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing.",

They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

Relative humidity is a measure of how much water vapour is in the air as a percentage of how much water vapour the air can hold in total. Warm air can hold more water vapour than colder air, therefore, for the same amount of water, the relative humidity in warm air is lower. This means that the lowest relative humidity in the cabin will occur when the cabin is warm. In the same way, to have the lowest relative humidity in the cabin, there has to be a small amount of water in the air. The way to do this is to have a cold outside air temperature, because that causes the outside air to hold less water in the first place. Especially if the arcraft was flying through a cloud, which has 100% relative humidity, there would be less water in the air if the air was colder. This means that we require a cold temperature outside to get the lowest relative humidity. This is a practical subject for human performance and limitations as humidity is often very low on aircraft, which causes dryness effects, that need to be counteracted sometimes.",

When decompression occurs, nitrogen and other inert gases that are normally dissolved in body tissue and fluid expand to form bubbles that rise out of the solution, in the same way that dissolved CO2 appears as bubbles when you uncap a bottle of soda. These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness. These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. Bends. Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

Presbyopia is a type of long sightedness that occurs usually over the age of 40 due to hardening of the lens. The vision deteriorates because the lens lose its elasticity with age and its ability to vary the focal length. The result is that close objects become blurred and the individuals find it difficult to read small print in poor lighting conditions.

But did you know that exercise has both short and long term effects on the cardiovascular system? The cardiovascular system delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body, and consists of the heart and the blood vessels. Short Term Effects of Exercise on the Cardiovascular System Many short-term effects take place during physical activity, including: Faster heart contractions. This leads to an increased heart rate and increased circulation, which gets oxygenated blood to your muscles quicker. More forceful heart contractions with each heartbeat, which leads to a greater amount of blood being pumped throughout the body. Long Term Effects of Exercise on the Cardiovascular System A fairly well conditioned athlete can see long term cardiovascular effects from exercising in as little as two weeks. People who are just beginning to exercise will see effects in up to four weeks. These effects include: The heart and lungs become more efficient as your cardiovascular training increases. Decreased resting heart rate, which means your heart doesn’t have to beat as often to circulate blood. Improved ability to draw in deeper and longer breaths, and take fewer breaths. Reduced risk of heart disease. \"3. it reduces the human susceptibility to hypoxia.\" Correct. Regular exercise conditions the individual's body to increase the number of red blood cells, which improves the oxygenation of the body - resulting in a higher tolerance to altitude hypoxia.",

This effect is prevalent during high accelerations/deccelerations and it is the tendency – in the absence of visual references – to incorrectly perceive acceleration as an increase in pitch attitude and deceleration as a decrease in pitch attitude. This occurs because, for instance, during a sudden forward linear acceleration, the otoliths are moved backwards. This will give the signals to the brain that the head is tilting backwards. Thus the pilot feel that he/she is climbing. The pilot’s response to this illusion would be to push the yolk or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down.

In this situation, in clear visibility conditions, the lack of haze can make objects appear closer than they actually are, leading to a risk of misjudging distance.

This blind spot is most problematic when vision from the other eye is partially or fully obscured, as that extra eye is usually what would fill in the blank section of vision, hence the reason we do not notice our blind spot in everyday life. If a pilot is looking in one direction with one eye obscured, there is a good chance that they would not see an aircraft on a constant relative bearing (stationary in the windshield) if it happens to lie within the blind spot of the working eye, meaning that the pilot may not be aware of the problem until it has come so close that its depiction is larger than the blind spot – which will most likely be too late to avoid a collision. This could be avoided by using a constant scan, to make sure the blind spot area is not always in the same place.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes and particular frequencies, especially 4000Hz, as these notes are normally detected by the cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it. As for the other options, presbycusis is a natural hearing loss that occurs with ageing, conductive hearing loss is anything to do with the failure of the sound conduction within the ear (usually infection or wax build-up) and temporary hearing loss is the short-term precursor to NIHL.",

EASA distinguishes three physiological thresholds: Reaction threshold. The altitude of 7 000 ft is referred to as the reaction threshold. It is the altitude at which even a healthy person may start to experience symptoms of hypoxia. Above this limit, the body reacts to the decreasing oxygen supply by increasing the rate and depth of breathing as well as the stroke volume to ensure full performance. One of the first things to deteriorate is night vision, and that is what we have seen in this question. Disturbance threshold. The altitude band of 10 000 to 12 000 ft is called the disturbance threshold, because the compensatory mechanisms of the body are not powerful enough to ensure full operation. Performance will be reduced and flight safety may be impaired. Critical threshold. The altitude of 22 000 ft is referred to as the critical threshold. The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is reduced to equal the minimum required blood partial pressure, no diffusion of oxygen into the blood will be possible. Of course, the thresholds are for information only, and are not legal thresholds (but EASA do quote them exactly, like in this question). The effects of hypoxia can vary quite a lot from person to person, especially in smokers, who can begin to feel the disturbance threshold effects as low as 5 000 ft sometimes.",

The instructions should be not less restrictive than the following: (a) no alcohol should be consumed less than 8 hours prior to the specified reporting time for a flight duty period or the commencement of standby; (b) the blood alcohol level should not exceed the lower of the national requirements or 0.2 per thousand at the start of a flight duty period; (c) no alcohol should be consumed during the flight duty period or whilst on standby. The law states the maximum blood alcohol level for a pilot starting their duty, and the minimum length of time between alcohol consumption and reporting for duty. The pilot also has to be \"fit to fly\", which is unfortunately subjective, and depends on many factors, none of which are easy to determine. This subjectivity is the difficult part of this question. The pilot has been drinking 8 units a day for 2 weeks, and the assumed metabolic rate for removing alcohol from the body is 1 unit per hour. Going a bit deeper than the syllabus does, this 1 unit per hour does not start immediately, and it can differ wildly between people, or even between the same person on different days, depending on food, fluid consumption, sleep, and most importantly, alcohol level in the blood in the first place. The average maths say that the pilot should have metabolised the alcohol out of their system every day before their next session of drinking, but actually, there is a good chance that this would not be the case, especially if their drinking sessions last a few hours, and if their metabolic rate is slow. Even if they can metabolise the alcohol in time to start drinking the next day, there are certain mental effects (and physiological effects on the liver) that will carry over onto the next day, and become cumulative over time. If this were 2 or 3 days of drinking 8 units a day, it would not make too much difference. The problem is that 2 weeks is long enough to carry quite some cumulative effect, even if the blood alcohol level is down to zero before the flight (which will probably be the case, or very close to zero). There are often some mental effects that continue well after the last drop of alcohol is metabolised, which are numerous and include the \"hangover\", amongst other detrimental effects. It is one of the major flaws in the regulations above. This question is obviously still quite subjective, but the pilot can decide that they are unfit themselves (does not have to be an aeromedical examiner) and so declaring themselves unfit for duty is acceptable, even though many pilots would probably not even think about this factor, given the time that has elapsed since their last alcoholic drink. Note: This question is still a difficult one, and any further feedback on it would be very useful to validate the answer that we have from feedback. Any such exam feedback can be emailed to info@atplquestions.com or put in the comments, thank you.",

May be due to a medical condition (anaemia - iron deficiency) or to carbon monoxide poisoning. HYPOXIC HYPOXIA is a situation where the partial pressure of oxygen within the lungs is not sufficient to oxygenate the arterial blood and fulfil the metabolic demand. It can be caused by a reduced rate of breathing, a lower percetage of oxygen in the air, or, more commonly in aviation, by a decreasing total air pressure with corresponding reduction is oxygen partial pressure. HISTOTOXIC HYPOXIA, also known as cytotoxic hypoxia - happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. This may occur in the case of poisoning by toxic fumes or liquids during an accident. However, it is more commonly observed in aviation with passengers due to excessive intake of alcohol or drugs and self-medication. STAGNANT HYPOXIA, also known as Ischemic hypoxia, is a condition where certain body parts or organs are not adequately supplied with blood. Even if the blood is sufficiently oxygenated. The main reason for the occurence of this type of hypoxia, in aviation, is positive acceleration along the vertical axis of the body. This makes the blood pool in the legs and restricts blood flow to the brain. Heart insufficiency may also cause stagnat hypoxia by reducing bloof perfusion throughout the body.",

The body’s circadian rhythms control the sleep-wake cycle. They play a role in sleep due to how the body and brain respond to darkness, which is when most humans feel tired and tend to sleep. As darkness sets in, the body’s biological clock instructs the cells to slow down. When the evening becomes dark, the hormone melatonin starts to rise and allows sleep to occur. Melatonin peaks around 2–4 A. M. and then reduces by morning, allowing wakefulness. There is also a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising.

After passing through the pupil, the light passes through a clear lens. Its shape is changed by the muscles (ciliary muscles) surrounding it which allow the final focusing onto the fovea - In order to focus clearly on a near object, the lens is thickened. To focus on a distant point, the lens is flattened. This focused light is directed onto the retina, a thin layer of light-sensitive nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye. Images are focused at its center (known as the macula) and converted into electrical impulses that are carried to the brain by the optic nerve, where they are translated into sight.",

The systemic circulation carries blood from the heart to all the other parts of the body and back again. Deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a big artery that comes from the heart and brings blood from the heart to the lungs. At the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. The blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Next, blood that returns to the heart has picked up lots of oxygen from the lungs. So it can now go out to the body.

MIDDLE EAR Attached to the ear drum there are three tiny bones called ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes or hammer, anvil and stirrup). Their purpose is to act as a bridge and transfer the sound vibrations from the outer to the inner ear. Part of the middle ear is the Eustachian tube which is connected to the back of the throat and equalizes the pressure between the middle ear and the environment. INNER EAR Attached to the stapes there is the oval window, which causes the fluid inside the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. These hail-like cells movement depends on the frequency and loudness of the sound received. Their movement is detected by the auditory nerve and is transfered to the cortex of the brain, where it will be decoded into sound. Consequently, the part of the inner ear responsible for sound perception is the fluid-filled cochlea. There is another part of the inner ear called vestibular system, which is responsible for balance-acceleration detection.",

Considering the mentioned rate of elimination, you will sober up after 4 to 6 hours.

Therefore, even if he/she is completely sober by then, he/she may still be affected by the adverse effects of drinking. Furthermore, the effects of a specific blood alcohol concentration can be more pronounced in flight than on the ground, due to the reduced oxygen partial pressure.

There is a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

Not all eyes form perfectly, and many people require some visual enhancement, such as in the cases of long-sightedness, short-sightedness and astigmatism: Long-sightedness (Hypermetropia). This is where the eyeball is slightly too short to correctly focus light on the retina at the back of the eye. Close-in objects become blurry, but far objects are much less effected. Spectacles have a converging lens to enhance the focusing effect of the cornea, fixing this. Short-sightedness (Myopia). The exact opposite, the eyeball is too long in this case, and far away objects are blurry, with closer objects less affected. Spectacles have diverging lens to reduce the focusing effect of the cornea, fixing this. Astigmatism. This is where the cornea is not spheroidal in shape, instead, it is not evenly shaped, and shapes can appear wrong. Cylindrical lenses can fix this, but surgery to the cornea can also be used to fix these abnormalities. The other option, presbyopia, is where the eyes become less elastic with aging, and become less able to accommodate, which becomes a weak form of long-sightedness, hence the need for many older people to use reading glasses.",

It is also where the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) transfers from our cells to the blood capillaries, as it is a waste product of the energy creation process. External respiration is the name of a process by the lungs, where fresh oxygen diffuses into the capillaries of the bloodstream from the alveoli in the lungs. The opposite process also occurs in the same place, where carbon dioxide diffuses from the bloodstream to the air in the lungs.

This learning objective outlines what we can expect to see in the exam, and it is debatable as whether obesity weakens the immune system, but it seems that EASA believe that it does not.

This lack of vestibular input leads to a false perception that the aircraft is straight and level, when in fact it is not. Although the semicircular canals provide accurate information about angular movements of the head in the natural environment, difficulties arise when the speed of rotation is held steady for several seconds, or when the rate of turn increases or decreases at a steady rate (constant angular acceleration).",

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint. You may also break out into a cold sweat.

Burning food with visible smoke are classified as a fumes event and a report must be filed. Discharging a fire extinguisher in itself is not a fume event. But i tis true that BCFs contain Halon so are damaging to the environment (ozone layer). Note: This question is based on new 2020 examination student feedback.

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

This is because the runway does not match previous experience. It is unfamiliar. In an attempt to make the narrower runway look normal, the pilot is likely to descend too early and too low. The approach appears to be too high, resulting in a low and flat approach and a late flare. A pilot approaching a wider runway is likely to feel too low due to the unfamiliarity of the scene.

Ozone (O3) is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms bonded together. It is a pale blue gas with a distinct, slightly sweet smell when present in low concentrations. Ozone plays a crucial role in the Earth's atmosphere, particularly in the ozone layer, which is a region of the stratosphere situated approximately 16 to 48 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Ozone is a highly toxic gas. In small amounts, it is an irritant to the lungs. Inhaling large amounts is deadly. Small ozone concentrations exist near the Earth's surface, in the troposphere. Ozone is a major component of smog and is formed through chemical reactions involving pollutants from various sources, including vehicle emissions and industrial processes. High concentrations of tropospheric ozone can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The ozone layer in the stratosphere is of utmost importance because it absorbs and filters out a significant portion of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Stratospheric ozone forms due to the action of ultraviolet light on oxygen. Ozone is most abundant at approximately 115,000 feet above sea level, with its concentration decreasing as altitude decreases. Below 40,000 feet, the presence of free ozone in the atmosphere is minimal or virtually nonexistent. Ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans. The higher the aircraft climbs, the higher the ozone exposure. Ozone quantities at modern cruising altitudes are not enough to cause any real harm, especially as most aircraft are fitted with ozone filters that will remove the majority of it from the cabin air. This allows us to bring the ozone concentration that is breathed in down below the prescribed limits.",

They act outwards from the centre of rotation and are experienced whenever an aircraft changes direction (predominantly +Gz). This type of acceleration is the most significant to pilots. During radial accelerations, fluid and tissues are displaced downwards. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms.",

The tympanum is connected to a chain of three small bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). The ossicles are parts of the middle ear which transmit sound vibrations through the middle ear (filled with air) to the inner ear (filled with fluid). The ossicles act as a bridge between the outer and the inner ear. The stapes, the last bone in the chain of the ossicles, is attached to the oval window, which is the beginning of the inner ear. In other words, the middle ear consists of the ossicles that connect the tympanum (outer ear) to the oval window (inner ear). The eustachian tube is a narrow tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat (pharynx). The primary function of the eustachian tube is to regulate the pressure in the middle ear. It does this by opening and closing to allow air to flow in and out of the middle ear. When we swallow, yawn, or chew, the muscles around the eustachian tube contract, which helps to open the tube and allow air to enter or exit the middle ear. This equalizes the pressure either side of the eardrum, between the middle ear and the environment. The eustachian tube is part of the middle ear and is responsible to equalize pressure either side of the eardrum, which is located between the outer and middle ear.",

PRESBYCUSIS Presbycusis is the loss of hearing that gradually occurs in most individuals as they grow older. The loss associated with presbycusis is usually greater for high-pitched sounds. For example, it may be difficult for someone to hear the nearby chirping of a bird or the ringing of a telephone. However, the same person may be able to hear clearly the low-pitched sound of a truck rumbling down the street. There are many causes of presbycusis. Most commonly it arises from changes in the inner ear of a person as he or she ages, but presbycusis can also result from changes in the middle ear or from complex changes along the nerve pathways leading to the brain. Presbycusis most often occurs in both ears, affecting them equally. Because the process of loss is gradual, people who have presbycusis may not realize that their hearing is diminishing.",

There is a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

Furthermore, it was reported in AGK of all subjects (we believe incorrectly), so we have placed it here, but do not know exactly where it may have come from. The normal glideslope angle should be flown to this runway. This will look different to normal (a flat runway on flat terrain), but can be judged by rate of descent and the relative movement of the visual picture if necessary, but a normal approach glideslope should be followed. The visual picture in this situation will make you think that you are too high, as both the upsloping terrain and runway make you think you are approaching the ground steeper than usual, when in fact the ground is rising to meet you. Your visual picture will feel \"too high\" on a normal glideslope, but that is what you must follow. The 15 degree offset is a silly idea as it provides further complication with no real benefit.",

It typically occurs at night with an overcast sky when flying over uninhabited areas with no ground lights, but also at daytime in absolutely clear skies over featureless terrain such as sea, a snow-covered landscape or a desert. This causes the pilot to overestimate his/her height above the ground. FLIGHT OVER ROCKS BEFORE THE RUNWAY As the aircraft approaches the rocky terrain, the ground suddenly appears to be too close to the aircraft. This creates the sensation to the pilot that the aircraft is flying too low. In reality, the aircraft may be at a safe altitude above the ground. This visual illusion causes the pilot to underestimate his/her height above the ground, and can lead to a climb and a high approach towards the runway.",

Your brain’s confused reaction makes you feel sick. \"Similarity between sensory inputs and terrestrial experiences.\" and \"Reduced sensitivity of the semicircular canal.\" Incorrect. Motion sickness is caused by the difference between sensory inputs and terrestrial experiences. A reduced sensitivity of the semicircular canal would lead to reduced symptoms. \"Anxiety and hyperventilation.\" Correct. Anxiety is a known trigger of and contributor to issues like motion sickness, so some people with anxiety tend to have worse nausea during car rides and similar movement. - Student pilots are frequently surprised by an uneasiness described as motion sickness which is probably a result of combining anxiety and unfamiliarity.",

If the autonomic nervous system (ANS) decides that the body needs more blood, due to any reason, then it will make the heart beat more frequently to increase the flow. There are a few main factors that increase the required blood flow, and therefore the heart rate: Adrenalin - the \"fight or flight\" response to stressors is extremely powerful in humans, and the corresponding response is an increase in heart rate - amongst other things - to be able to deal with the expected fighting, or running, etc. Physical exercise - the extra blood required to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells when the body is exercising means that the heart will have to work harder, with a higher heart rate. Obesity - The physical change in body size means that, the larger one's body becomes, the more pressure the blood will need to get around all the various blood vessels, requiring more pumping from the heart. There also can be some artery clogging which makes it harder for blood to flow, which can lead to heart attacks. High heat conditions - When in high heat conditions, the body needs to remove heat faster, by radiating it outwards from the skin. One of the best ways to do this is by sending more blood to the capillaries in the skin, which involved dilating (widening) the main arteries of the body. this decreases the blood pressure and therefore requires more beating from the heart to maintain an acceptable blood pressure. Dehydration - If you are dehydrated, the amount of blood circulating through your body decreases. Your heart will try to compensate by beating faster, increasing your heart rate. There are many more factors which affect the heart rate, and can even overpower the effects listed above sometimes.",

            "explanation": "One of the expectations a pilot has on final approach is the size of the runway in front of them. Deviations from a familiar runway size/slope can cause them to misjudge the remaining distance along the glide path. A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is higher than it actually is. If the pilot believes this illusion, they might pitch the aircraft’s nose down to lose altitude. Landing will also be hard in this case, because they will possibly flare late, expecting the runway to be larger in their windows, touching down with a large vertical speed. Furthermore, when approaching a runway with an upslope, the pilot views it at an increased angle, causing him to assume that he/she is higher above the runway than they actually are. The angle looks the same as being too high to a flat runway. The pilot might then increase their rate of descent and land short of the runway. As a result, the combination of a narrower runway with an upslope can easily make the pilot believe that they are actually high on approach. To correct this perception, they may descent too low, with the risk of landing short of the runway. Trusting their flight instruments should counteract this illusion.",

Poor lifestyle habits, such as a lack of exercise, can lead to high blood pressure. Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. As a recommendation, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week. This is not a lot of exercise, of course, so we would agree that it is only \"mild\".",

If the autonomic nervous system (ANS) decides that the body needs more blood, due to any reason, then it will make the heart beat more frequently to increase the flow. There are a few main factors that increase the required blood flow, and therefore the heart rate: Adrenalin - the \"fight or flight\" response to stressors is extremely powerful in humans, and the corresponding response is an increase in heart rate - amongst other things - to be able to deal with the expected fighting, or running, etc. Physical exercise - the extra blood required to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells when the body is exercising means that the heart will have to work harder, with a higher heart rate. Obesity - The physical change in body size means that, the larger one's body becomes, the more pressure the blood will need to get around all the various blood vessels, requiring more pumping from the heart. There also can be some artery clogging which makes it harder for blood to flow, which can lead to heart attacks. High heat conditions - When in high heat conditions, the body needs to remove heat faster, by radiating it outwards from the skin. One of the best ways to do this is by sending more blood to the capillaries in the skin, which involved dilating (widening) the main arteries of the body. this decreases the blood pressure and therefore requires more beating from the heart to maintain an acceptable blood pressure. Dehydration - If you are dehydrated, the amount of blood circulating through your body decreases. Your heart will try to compensate by beating faster, increasing your heart rate. Stress - A stressful situation sets off a chain of events. Your body releases adrenaline which causes your breathing and heart rate to speed up. There are many more factors which affect the heart rate, and can even overpower the effects listed above sometimes.",

In this system the individual is given two points for every hour spent asleep and has one point deducted for every hour spent awake. This is only a rough measure, as individuals vary considerably in the amount of sleep they require. The maximum credit available is 16 points. You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. When a person is required to be awake longer than the credit situation allows, a sleep debit situation will develop. If possible, the following sleep cycle will then be longer than 8 hours to rebuild the full 16 hours of sleep credit. While a short sleep debit will usually not cause any remarkable effects in healthy persons, sleep debit can become cumulative and result in reduced vigilance and performance, with an increased susceptibility to sensory illusions. This problem is very common when forced to work days (or nights) in a row with little time in between that to be used for building up sleep credit. Jet lag/circadian disrhythmia - occurs when conducting transmeridian long-distance flights where shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. Most likely, this question does not refer to long-haul flights but rather short-haul operations, where the crew always returns to base and no shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. The question possibly describes a situation of situational insomnia (inability to sleep due to disrupted work/rest patterns, or circadian dysrhythmia) rather than chronic insomnia (long-term pattern of difficulty sleeping).",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.",

Somatogravic illusion is one of the most common forms of vestibular or false sensation illusion which may be encountered when no clear horizon is present and flying wholly or partly by visual external reference is attempted. This effect is prevalent during high accelerations/deccelerations and it is the tendency – in the absence of visual references – to incorrectly perceive acceleration as an increase in pitch attitude and deceleration as a decrease in pitch attitude. This occurs because, for instance, during a sudden forward linear acceleration, the otoliths are moved backwards. This will give the signals to the brain that the head is tilting backwards. Thus the pilot feel that he/she is climbing. The pilot’s response to this illusion would be to push the yolk or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down.

Consequently, this may create an illusion of obtaining greater height above the trees (the pilot will assume that the aircraft has climbed away from them).",

Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. It can stem from different factors. Social factors can contribute to a person’s views of drinking. Your culture, religion, family and work influence many of your behaviors, including drinking. Family plays the biggest role in a person’s likelihood of developing alcoholism. Children who are exposed to alcohol abuse from an early age are more at risk of falling into a dangerous drinking pattern. Researchers have examined whether or not a person’s proximity to alcohol retail stores or bars affect their chances of alcoholism. People who live closer to alcohol establishments are said to have a more positive outlook on drinking and are more likely to participate in the activity. Different psychological factors may increase the chances of heavy drinking. Every person handles situations in their own unique way. However, how you cope with these feelings can impact certain behavioral traits. For example, people with high stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions are more vulnerable to developing alcoholism. In these types of circumstances, alcohol is often used to suppress feelings and relieve the symptoms of psychological disorders.",

The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude.

Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

An effective method to reduce the chances of developing coronary artery disease is to eliminate risk factors. For instance, quitting smoking is considered the most effective step and the consumption of alcohol should be kept to a minimum. Another powerful measure is to reach and maintain a healthy body weight. This should be achieved by a good diet and physical activity. One of the benefits of exercise is the economisation of the cardiovascular activity. A strong heart can pump more blood around your body with less effort. Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy. To be effective in reducing coronary artery disease, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.",

This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

Such difference results from the air conditioning system of modern aircraft drawing air from outside the aircraft - At airline operating altitudes, the air is very cold and can only hold very little amount of water vapour. Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. It is paramount that a person compensates for this very low humidity by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration - thrist is a late symptom of dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration may include headache, feeling dizzy or lightheaded and muscle cramps. Remember that even slight dehydration can cause a reduction in performance.

From the aavailable options, the following factors can contribute to anemia: 1. Iron deficit: Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A deficiency in iron is one of the most common causes of anemia, known as iron-deficiency anemia. Without adequate iron, the body cannot produce enough healthy red blood cells. 2. Malaria: Malaria is a parasitic infection that destroys red blood cells. The parasite Plasmodium, which causes malaria, infects red blood cells and causes them to rupture. This destruction of red blood cells leads to anemia. 4. Smoking: Smoking can contribute to anemia by causing chronic inflammation and reducing the absorption of nutrients essential for red blood cell production, such as iron and folate. Additionally, the carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke binds to hemoglobin more readily than oxygen, which can reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. The incorrect option is: 3. Potassium deficit: Potassium is an essential mineral for various bodily functions, including maintaining proper muscle function and heart rhythm. However, a deficiency in potassium does not directly cause anemia.",

Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system and maintain the seals according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Ideal properties of a hydraulic fluid: Low compressibility: to ensure instantaneous operation; Good lubrication and anti-corrision properties: hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system; High flash point and low flammability: fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components; Low volatility: be resistant to evaporation; Adequate viscosity: the fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures.

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

There is a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Sleep is most restful when going to sleep while the temperature is falling. The best physical and mental performance, on the other hand, is achieved during times of rising or high body temperature, whereat mental or intellectual performance is better in the morning. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle.

The main role of plasma is to transfer its components around the body (i.e. proteins and hormones) and help carry the waste products away. 2) BLOOD CELLS i) Red blood cells (RBCs): The RBCs transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs. They contain a protein called hemoglobin which binds oxygen in the lungs and release it in tissues, facilitating cellular respiration. ii) White blood cells: White blood cells are integral to the immune system and play an essential role in defending the body against infections and foreign invaders. iii) Platelets: Platelets are critical for preventing excessive bleeding and facilitating wound healing. Their role in hemostasis ensures that blood clots form appropriately in response to injury.

A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

The upper value signifies the systolic pressure, representing the pressure produced by the heart when it contracts to circulate blood throughout the body. The lower value is the diastolic pressure, denoting the constant pressure within the arterial system. These pressures are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The normal range of blood pressure fluctuates with age, but a young and fit adult usually exhibits a systolic pressure of around 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of about 80 mm Hg (120/80). Hypertension or high blood pressure is blood pressure of 140/95 or higher. Hypertension can be a factor in cardiovascular failure and it might be caused due to stress, age, obesity, narrowing of the arteries or lack of exercise. Hypotension or low blood pressure typically doesn't pose a significant threat. Nonetheless, if the pressure diminishes excessively, resulting in insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues, it can give rise to various symptoms. Hypotension is generally diagnosed when systolic pressure falls below 90 mm Hg or diastolic pressure falls below 60 mm Hg (90/60). The systolic pressure of 160 is very high. The diastolic pressure of 95 is hypertension starting point. As a result, the recorded combination of 160/95 is classified as hypertension.",

Preventive measures include: Learning that sensory illusions (visual and vestibular) are common inflight occurrences that represent normal human responses to unusual sensor stimulations. Pilots should also learn to not trust their sensory perceptions under various circumstances that promote illusions, and to avoid sudden intuitive control manipulations based on these innacurate orientational perceptions. Understanding the nature of various illusions and their contributing factors to be aware of inflight conditions that are likely to promote the occurrence of such illusions. Learn to utilize and rely on orientational information available from non-sensory sources such as attitude instrument displays, radar, radar altimeter, navigation instrumentation, visual glideslope aids and other instruments.
