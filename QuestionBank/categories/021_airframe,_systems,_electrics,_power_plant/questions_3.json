There are many potential weak points in this, including windows, hatches, and doors. Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage. They can be manually operated, and often are.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds (it is therefore used on a continuous basis during the entire flight). If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance. Another rationale for the constant operation of the window heating system is the mitigation of thermal gradients. When the window heating system is activated, it ensures that the window pane remains at a consistent temperature throughout the entirety of the flight.",

As for the other options: Engine driven pumps require the engines to be on, and that would be very hazardous for ground crew trying to open the cargo doors, so is not feasible. A ram air turbine is a small wind turbine that drops from the underside of an aircraft to provide power/hydraulic pressure to important controls in flight. It is not used on the ground, nor would it be useful without any airflow through it. A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc.",

Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, mineral-based and synthetic-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids.

The RAT generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump. Consequently, more power is generated when the aircraft is operating at a higher speed and less is generated when operating at lower speeds.",

They also act as a lubricating medium, thereby reducing the friction between moving parts and carrying away some of the heat. Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. In aviation, mainly mineral or synthetic based oil are used: DTD 585: a refined mineral based oil. Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system and maintain the seals according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Ideal properties of a hydraulic fluid: Low compressibility: to ensure instantaneous operation; Good lubrication and anti-corrision properties: hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system; High flash point and low flammability: fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components; Low volatility: be resistant to evaporation; Adequate viscosity: the fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures. The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability.",

Whilst this is an awful question, which pilots would usually have no business dealing with, it can still be worked out with the normal knowledge from the syllabus. A hydraulic accumulator is a device used to store hydraulic pressure, for the purposes of smoothing out hydraulic pressure changes, and storing the pressure in case there is a loss of hydraulic pump, so a finite amount of pressure remains for further uses. It works by compressing nitrogen inside the accumulator with the force of the hydraulic fluid, and then the high pressure nitrogen is where the energy is stored. There are a few different ways to do this, via diaphragm, with a moving piston between the fluid and the nitrogen, and with no separation at all, just gravity. These are the types of gas charged accumulators, but there are also spring accumulators and even weighted accumulators that can be used. We do not normally look into these though. If an accumulator was mounted horizontally, the gravity option would not keep the fluid in the lines, so would not work. Therefore only a diaphragm or (more likely) a moving piston would be used in this orientation. This should mean that there is no cross-contamination of nitrogen and hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid stays on one side of the piston/diaphragm, the nitrogen stays on the other side. If, as in this scenario, there is an amount of hydraulic fluid leaving the nitrogen release valve, then there must have been some sort of leak between the two, for hydraulic fluid to enter the nitrogen section.",

In this case, hydraulic pressure is a gauge pressure, and is therefore measured against atmospheric pressure. We can also work this out by thinking about what happens when you de-pressurise a hydraulic system completely. The hydraulic pressure will read 0 PSI, as the fluid is exerting the same amount of pressure on its surroundings as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 PSI greater than a vacuum (i.e. its absolute pressure is 14.7 PSI, or 1013 hPa). For instance, manifold pressure gauges read out MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure), so show the absolute ambient pressure when the engine is off. Other systems rarely read out absolute pressure.",

This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. Note: The wording is unconfirmed on this question as it came from limited feedback, but we don't expect any significant differences to the real exam, certainly nothing that will change the answer.",

The harder the brake pedal is pushed, the more friction the brakes make. This is known as a \"passive\" hydraulic system, as it does not have any other source of hydraulic pressure like a hydraulic pump. The energy comes only from the person pressing the brake pedal(s). An active hydraulic system is used for braking (and many other things) on large aircraft, where a system is constantly pressurised and the brakes are operated by action on the brake pedals effectively turning a valve to allow more or less of that pressure to work on the brakes. This allows much stronger braking action than a human could possibly produce.",

Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids.

There are quite a few different ways of creating a constant delivery pump, primarily for the ATPLs we usually think of a gear style pump for this purpose, but for context we have attached an image that shows some possible pump designs. Bear in mind that constant pressure pumps have less options for how they can be constructed (usually an axial piston pump design with a control piston).",

On some large aircraft (such as the Airbus A320 family), the cargo doors are very heavy and are therefore lifted by hydraulics. They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc. Power transfer units are used to transfer hydraulic pressure (not fluid) from one system to another, but one system has to be pressurised for this to work, and that is not the case in this scenario. External hydraulic power units do not exist for this kind of scenario. That is a fake option, playing on the fact that external air carts and external ground power units can feed the aircraft pneumatic systems and electrical systems, but not hydraulics.",

Only the simplest hydraulic systems, such as the brake circuit on a light aircraft, are powered by human effort. All advanced hydraulic systems use some form of pump to increase hydraulic pressure and facilitate fluid flow under pressure. Hydraulic systems can be classified as either: Low-pressure systems: Typically operating up to 2000 PSI. High-pressure systems: Typically operating at 3000 PSI, though some aircraft may use hydraulic pressures of 4000 to 5000 PSI. High pressure reduces fluid volume and component mass. However, even at higher pressures, hydraulic fluid is considered incompressible. Very high pressures can induce shear stresses in the fluid, leading to adverse hydraulic effects. Additionally, there is a slightly increased risk of fluid leaks at joints in the lines. Properties High Pressure Low Pressure Weight (similar size aircraft) Lighter due to smaller actuators Higher Force Able to apply extremely large forces Unable to apply larger forces Construction Complex Simple Pressure Yes No",

Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, mineral-based and synthetic-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system as breakdown of the seals is likely which will cause fluid leakage.",

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It runs at a constant RPM and modulates its volumetric flow output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. In terms of hydraulic pressures, most large transport aircraft have hydraulic pressures in the range of 3000 - 5000 psi as this is a good amount to power heavy control surfaces and landing gear systems, etc. Larger aircraft tend to have higher pressures in general, and the Airbus A380 runs hydraulic pressures of 5000 psi, whereas Boeing 737s run at 3000 psi.",

Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. In aviation, mainly mineral or synthetic based oil are used: DTD 585: a refined mineral based oil. Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, mineral-based and synthetic-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system as breakdown of the seals is likely which will cause fluid leakage.",

The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability. Hydraulic fluids are also \"irritating to skin and eyes\" according to the Learning Objectives. This is another reason that we believe that the corrosion answer is most correct. The internal workings of the hydraulic system will be metal, perhaps with special coatings, but certainly not paint. The aircraft is covered with paint though, and anyone who has carelessly bled brakes before will know that brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) is corrosive to paintwork. Whether it will harm the bodywork underneath would depend on the material and the individual fluid. Whilst it should have good anti-corrosion properties, who knows how good those are, especially against different materials. Important Note: We have received conflicting feedback about this question. Any further exam feedback would therefore be very useful to help us verify this question, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments.

This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure.",

The gas side of the accumulator is charged to a predetermined pressure with air or nitrogen. As the accumulator is fitted and the hydraulic pressure in the system builds up, the gas in the accumulator will be compressed until fluid and gas pressures equalise at normal system pressure. That is why the accumulator gauge will read the same as the hydraulic system is pressurised to. The correct answer mentions that it provides \"hydraulic power\" in the event of a system failure or emergency, which is correct, as the gas is compressed to store energy which keeps the fluid pressurised in order to provide power onto hydraulic actuators if the pumps fail.

The cylinder and the drive-shaft are coaxial and rotate taking the pistons which can move up and down in the cylinder. The pistons are a connected to shoes to the non-rotating yoke or swash plate. The angle of the swash-plate and thus the piston stroke is varied by the position of the control piston. This piston is controlled by the outlet pressure on one side of it and a spring on the other. If the pump is stationary there will be no hydraulic pressure and so the spring will push the control piston to the right and the swash-plate angle will be maximum. As the pump begins to rotate the pistons will start moving up and down because of the angle of the swash-plate. If the required operating pressure is reached, the control piston will be pushed back to the left causing the swash-plate to be almost vertical and therefore the pistons’ stroke will be minimal. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 2 shows the pump at maximum stroke and picture 3 shows the pump at minimum stroke.",

Larger aircraft with multiple main gear wheels often mount the main landing gear on bogie beams, which are excellent for absorbing direct impacts during landing, but can suffer from very high sideways loads during tight turns whilst taxiing. These sideways loads also put a lot of sideways stress on the tyres, which can only rotate forwards and backwards, of course, so will get unnecessarily \"scrubbed\" during tight turns. This effect can be reduced somewhat by giving the main gear bogie beams a small amount of available steering angle, which is only used in slow speed tight turns, turning the opposite direction of the nose wheel to turn sideways forces into longitudinal forces on the main gear assemblies, thereby reducing stress on the torsional links and reducing tyre abrasion.

INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never ensure the required stopping distance – take-off has to be avoided. INCORRECT, while manual braking significantly increases the braking distance (50%) this doesn’t mean the stopping distance available isn’t long enough. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. Manual braking When the anti-skid is inoperative the braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition.

The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper.

Please do let us know if you see this question in the real exam and anything you can remember about it, thank you. Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.06: Describe the various protection devices to avoid inadvertent gear retraction on the ground and explain the implications of taking off with one or more protection devices in place: ground lock (pins); protection devices in the gear retraction mechanism. Let's go through the options: \"Insert the ground lock pins.\" Correct. Ground lock pins are for the landing gear when an aircraft has a retractable undercarriage, and they slot into the gear downlock system to make sure that the gear cannot retract whilst on the ground, no matter what happens to the hydraulics or external conditions. For long term storage, they must be fitted. They are part of the pilot's checks before flight, also, as leaving them in will not allow the landing gear to be raised. \"Leave the parking brakes on.\" Incorrect. The parking brakes of an aircraft are just sealed off hydraulic fluid, and leaving them on for extended periods of time can lead to seizing of the brakes, or potentially a leak of the hydraulic fluid through small imperfections in the system, allowing the brakes to gradually release. Aircraft are chocked or tied down for long term storage. \"Leave the flaps in the extended position to release the hydraulic pressure.\" Incorrect. Flaps should be up for long term storage, to avoid wind damage, damage to the mechanism, keep birds from nesting in the flap tracks, etc. The hydraulic pressure has nothing to do with it. \"Always park the aircraft facing upwind.\" Whilst this is best practice, it cannot always be done, and even if you park into wind one day, for long periods of parking, the wind will change and the aircraft will no longer be into wind all the time.",

            "explanation": "Refer to the figure Large aircraft have Oleo-Struts as shock absorbers, an example in the picture attached. An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

Correct, tiller nose wheel steering has a deflection up to 78 degrees where rudder pedal steering has a maximum of 7 degrees. When performing a rudder check during taxiing there is no need for additional pilot action to avoid deflection of the nose wheel. Incorrect, there is a need for additional pilot action to avoid deflection of the nose wheel.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to just drop naturally under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversible operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through a mechanical linkage. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. The weight of the gear will also push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical downlocks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. There are other systems available for emergency gear extension, such as electrical or pneumatic, but gravity free-fall is so much more common due to its simplicity and lack of potential failure points. It is often aided by pneumatic pressure or a similar system to release the uplocks though.",

As previously discussed, RTO does NOT provide a predetermined fixed braking force. Instead, it always ensures the maximum available braking power. “Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft.” INCORRECT. As discussed, the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft is by using the autobrakes which will reduce the pilot’s workload and allow them to focus on other tasks, i.e. directional control. “Without pilot input, the RTO mode will automatically brake the aircraft to a full stop.” This one is ambiguous and unfortunately, we have to assume that the pilot has not yet taken the decision to abort take off – meaning that he hasn’t retarded the power levers. As you know, in order to activate the RTO mode, some conditions must be met - One of those conditions is that the pilot has to bring the power levers to the idle position. Only then the RTO will brake the aircraft to a full stop. Even though, this statement isn’t completely wrong, it isn’t completely accurate either.",

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

On the majority of cars, this means the force you apply to the brake pedal pressurises the brake fluid (hydraulic fluid), and this pressure is used to push a piston (actuator) to force brake pads (stators) into brake discs (rotors) connected to each wheel. The harder you push the pedal, the harder the brake pads contact the discs, the more friction is caused, and the harder you decelerate. This is a manual braking system. In light aircraft, the same system is present, but in large aircraft, many thousands of times more braking force is needed, requiring large multi-disk brakes on many more wheels, and your feet are just not able to provide enough force to apply these brakes, no matter how much you go to the gym. This means that the brakes run off the normal hydraulic system, and your feet (or the autobrake - if fitted) are now simply moving a valve to provide more or less hydraulic pressure to the brake actuators. This means that, given large aircraft hydraulic systems can run from 3000 to 5000 psi, these can provide much more braking force, and the power comes from hydraulic pumps, not your feet. PARKING BRAKES Parking brakes operate the same in almost all aircraft, no matter whether you are using manual brakes or a hydraulically assisted system. They use a simple shut-off valve upstream of the brake actuators, and whilst the brakes are being applied, with the pads pushed into the disks, the valve is closed to trap that hydraulic pressure inside the braking system and keep those wheels stopped. The only difference is how much pressure is trapped within the brakes when you set it on. In a light aircraft, you need to push the brakes hard enough when setting the parking brake, or they might not be fully set on. Most large aircraft will not let you make this mistake. If you do leave parking brakes set on for a long time, small leaks within the system may slowly allow the pressure to drop and the brakes might slowly release, or the brakes could go the other way and seize in place, so aircraft should not have them set for too long, and instead chocks and tie-downs should be used to secure aircraft for long periods.",

When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. This mode uses maximum braking, which will either be limited by the anti-skid system on poor traction surfaces, tyre limitations, or by the maximum brake pressure. The use of reverse thrust is beneficial for stopping distance, but in RTO mode the autobrake will continue to apply maximum braking until disarmed or stopped, irrespective of the deceleration rate.

The most common kinds you will see are the hand crank, hand pump hydraulic, free fall and pressurized nitrogen bottle systems. These systems are designed for emergency gear extension - not retraction. Failure of gear to retract is not an emergency unless it retracts partially and cannot be extended again A hand crank system is often found on aeroplanes with electric gear systems. The crank is employed to turn the gears that operate the actuators manually instead of through the electric motor. If you fly an aeroplane with a hydraulic system, you might use a hydraulic hand pump system to extend the gear when the primary pump fails. You do so by supplying the necessary hydraulic fluid pressure to the actuator cylinders by pumping a hand pump. A freefall system is another method of gear extension used on aeroplanes that have hydraulic gear systems. A control lever is used to open a valve that releases the system pressure. Hydraulic pressure equalizes on both sides of the gear actuators and allow the landing gear to fall into position through the force of gravity and aerodynamic loads. In the pressurized nitrogen bottle system, the nitrogen is not directly used to actuate the landing gear actuators or brake units but, instead, it applies the pressurized nitrogen to move hydraulic fluid to the actuator.",

This pin is inserted into the landing gear mechanism during ground operations, typically as part of the aircraft's parking procedures, maintenance, or pre-flight checks. The primary function of the landing gear anti-retract pin is to prevent the landing gear from retracting while the aircraft is on the ground.

Therefore, it does not provide a predetermined fixed braking force. “Manual braking is always the best stopping technique for a rejected take-off.” INCORRECT. Especially when conditions are less than ideal (shorter and wet runways), or rejected take off, many flight crews prefer to use the autobrake rather than use manual braking, and devote their attention to the use of rudder for directional control => “the machine does the braking and I maintain directional control”. Autobrake reduces pilots’ workload and allows them to channel their attention to other important duties. Furthermore, with autobrake, the human’s reaction time on pressing the brakes is eliminated – therefore, it is more efficient. “When the RTO mode is armed, the system will operate at any speed when the take-off is aborted.” INCORRECT. The wheel speed must be at least (around) 90 kts and the thrust levers must be moved to idle position. In case of an aborted take off below wheel speed of 90 kts, the autobrake system will not activate. “Without pilot interference an auto-brake system continues to operate until standstill.” CORRECT. Unless the system is disarmed by flight crew pressing the pushbutton switch or applying enough deflection to at least one brake pedal – the autobrake will bring the aircraft to a complete stop.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "Anti-skid systems have several functions, but most importantly, they help braking by maintaining an optimum wheel-slip value. Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance. In addition to the main optimised braking function, anti-skid systems offer other functions including: The ASU prevents brake application before touchdown on landing. It will prevent any brake pressure even if brake pedals are pressed before touchdown to allow the stationary wheels to spin-up to speed on contact. Only after spin-up does the ASU allow brake preassure application. The ASU protects against the locking of any wheel during the braking process by avoiding excessive wheel-slip values. The ASU protects against the effects of hydroplanning.",

            "explanation": "Brakes on a car are operated by the driver pushing on the brake pedal, which uses a piston to squeeze hydraulic fluid into the brake lines, which then applies a force on the brake pads, pressing the pads onto the spinning disks to create friction, which gives braking action. This is, of course, a hydraulic system. Hydraulic systems are an excellent way to transfer forces around a vehicle like a car or an aircraft. The main benefit of hydraulics is that the fluid is not compressible, so the force from the brake pedal piston is immediately (and completely) transferred onto the brake pads. This applies to an aircraft as well, as the only difference is that large aircraft brakes use multiple brake pads (stators) and brake disks (rotors), and the braking systems are usually supplemented by the high pressure hydraulic systems that run the rest of the aircraft's systems to gain higher forces than just the pilot's feet can produce. The emergency braking system that is mentioned in this question is to be used in the case of a loss of hydraulic pressure, and extra pressure can be gained by firing a single burst of high pressure gas into the brake lines, which then allow the brakes to be used (not nicely, but better than nothing). Because of the gas (most likely Nitrogen to reduce fire risk) now inside the hydraulic brake lines, the force applied to the pedals is not going to be completely applied to the brakes, as some of the pressure is absorbed by the compression of the gas in the lines. This makes the brakes feel \"soft\" or \"spongy\" underfoot, and not nearly as reactive or sensitive. After this is used, the brake lines will have to be bled again to remove the remaining air in the system, and replace it completely with hydraulic fluid. The gas canister will be replaced for emergency brake system use in the future. Mention of the anti-skid system is there to throw you off. Anti-skid improves braking by stopping the wheels from locking up, so actually increases brake temperature (or does not affect it, depending on the conditions).",

Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.08: Describe the sequence for emergency gear extension: unlocking; operating; down-locking. All aircraft are different in their emergency gear extension, but on the whole, the concept is the same. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. Many system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. We are assuming that \"activating the uplocks\" in this sense refers to the mechanical unlocking process of the gear uplocks. This is usually a cable that is pulled from the flight deck by some means, which overcomes the spring tension on the uplock, releasing the gear (and/or gear doors) to extend by gravity. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure (not the selector valves, they are different) Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

AUTOBRAKE SYSTEM The autobrake system uses hydraulic system pressure to provide maximum braking in the event of a rejected take-off and automatic braking at preselected deceleration rates immediately after touchdown on landing. REJECTED TAKEOFF (RTO) The RTO mode can be selected (armed) only when on the ground. The RTO mode will engage when a few conditions are met, such as being above 88kts and setting the thrust levers to idle (B737). The airbus A320 doesn't have a named RTO mode, but MAX is only ever used for RTOs and it engages when the ground spoilers deploy, which is at or above 72 kt and with thrust levers set to idle. They are all very similar systems, with small variations. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually. It does not provide a constant rate of deceleration as the landing autobrake modes attempt to do. You could argue that it \"applies the anti-skid maximum braking\" as anti-skid would reduce the brake pressure if the traction is not good enough, but this is not mentioned and we would consider this a less correct answer, particularly after looking at the learning objectives and previous questions.",

The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). Autobrakes have quite a simple logic system, depending on their mode of operation, they use the wheel brakes to slow down the aircraft at a pre-determined, constant rate of deceleration (you can think of it as a constant G-force, or a constant amount of knots lost per second). This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

For example, on the Boeing 737, upon selection, the AUTOBRAKE DISARM light illuminates for one to two seconds and then extinguishes, indicating that an automatic self-test has been successfully accomplished. To arm the RTO mode prior to take-off, the following conditions must exist: airplane on the ground antiskid and autobrake systems operational AUTO BRAKE select switch positioned to RTO wheel speed less than 60 kt forward thrust levers positioned to IDLE With RTO selected, if the take-off is rejected prior to wheel speed reaching 90 knots autobraking is not initiated, the AUTOBRAKE DISARM light does not illuminate and the RTO autobrake function remains armed. If the take-off is rejected after reaching a wheel speed of 90 knots, maximum braking is applied automatically when the forward thrust levers are retarded to IDLE. Please note that the above example is true for the Boeing 737. The Rejected Take-off Mode (RTO) varies from one aircraft type to another, however the concept remains the same. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually.",

As bad as the wording in this question is, the first part is simple. In all aircraft, the landing gear is an active system, in that it requires a power source to function, in this case it is hydraulic pressure that powers it. The landing gear in some aircraft can be lowered passively (gravity extension), but cannot be raised passively. So now for the second part of the question. The power for the hydraulic system in all large aircraft comes from engine driven pumps. These pumps are driven by the auxiliary gearbox connected to one of the engine shafts. Electric hydraulic pumps are also present, and provide the same amount of pressure, but have a much lower displacement as they are much smaller, weaker pumps. Therefore, when landing gear is raised, the vast majority of the load is placed on the engine driven pumps, and is therefore fed by power from the auxiliary gearbox.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objectives 021.04.03.04.04: Describe how an autobrake system setting will either apply maximum braking (RTO or MAX) or result in a given rate of deceleration, where the amount of braking applied may be affected by: the use of reverse thrust; slippery runway. While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

The torsion link provides that mechanical connection between the inner and the outer cylinder (the wheel and the aircraft) in only one direction, preventing sideways movement, whilst still allowing shock absorption by the oleo in the up and down direction, as it moves in and out due to its \"scissor link\" design. The torsion link does carry lots of stress, therefore, when the aircraft wants to turn and the wheel does not. For example, a main wheel (without steering capability) going round a tight corner where the aircraft wants to twist sideways but the wheel does not.

            "explanation": "Pre-flight inspections must confirm whether the condition of the tyre is suitable for operation. Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Note: If you find cuts in the tire, it’s important to make sure that they haven’t cut into the ply of the tire. Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. \"5. Oil contamination on the tyre surface\" Correct. Oil contamination (i.e. brake oil, fuel, tar oil, solvents, chemicals) can degrade the rubber of the tire. Typically, the standard approach involves cleaning the tire with Isopropyl Alcohol. However, if the tire becomes sticky, it becomes necessary to replace the wheel. Hydrocarbons have a detrimental effect on rubber, causing it to lose its essential properties, thereby reducing tire performance.",

            "explanation": "“When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides the capability to select a fixed landing distance” INCORRECT. Only a few aircraft do that, I believe the A350 and A380 – where you can actually go into the computer and say “this is the runway we are landing on, and I actually want to vacate at this specific exit” because it has the runway in the database and all the different taxiways off the runway and, therefore, you can use the autobrake and select to vacate at a certain exit and it will make sure you have the right speed to vacate => but that is not the majority of the aeroplanes. Ultimately, it is not very practical because there are a lot of different factors. On most aircrafts, it just provides a fixed deceleration rate but not a fixed landing distance (seen it is subjected to wind as well). You can never say it will precisely take this xxx amount of distance. Hopefully, this makes sense. “The achievable deceleration levels of full manual braking and the auto-brake RTO mode are the same” CORRECT. So if you press on the pedals as hard as you possibly can, it’s going to give you a maximum deceleration rate and it will also ensure that the wheels don’t lock up – which is exactly the same as autobrake max/RTO. If you look at the pushbutton, it says MAX - maximum amount of braking so it is the same as if you push on the pedals as hard as you can. (Don’t forget that you’ve got antiskid which works in conjunction with autobrake as well) => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. But the thing with the autobrake is that, as soon as the pilot decides to reject the take off and closes the thrust levers, then the maximum braking pressure gets applied immediately. Whereas, if you were to take off without autobrake, and then decided to abort the take-off, you’d first think about “right, I have got to close the thrust levers” and then you’ve got to think to press on the brake pedals => so, there’s obviously an element of delay in that. And that is why the stopping distance in the event of a manual rejected take off would be greater, even though the brake pressure on the brakes, would be exactly the same under both circumstances. Hopefully that kind of makes sense. Video Explanation:",

All the tire needs is a new tread. Airplane tires can be expensive: there is no logical reason to scrap a tire for an aircraft when it can be safely and economically reconditioned with a new tread. This is why retreading has been standard practice in the aviation industry for decades. The maximum retread level for the part number is set only after extensive testing and analysis. Some airplane tyres can be safely retreaded up to seven or more times, but there is always a limit and the limit is always set with an abundance of caution. The retread process is easy to understand. A worn tyre is removed from an aircraft. It is sent back to a retreading firm, often a manufacturer of airplane tires. When the firm receives a tire for retreading it is carefully inspected to ensure that it is safe and economical to retread. The tyre is scrapped if technicians consider there to be doubt about its airworthiness.",

Conventional brake discs are typically fashioned from steel, boasting durability, cost-efficiency, and consistent braking performance. Carbon is also harnessed in brake assembly due to its superior heat absorption and dissipation characteristics. Carbon brakes exhibit notably lighter weight compared to their steel counterparts.

A skid not corrected can quickly lead to a tire blowout, possible damage to the aircraft, and control of the aircraft may be lost. One of the important issues to realize is that the anti-skid system greatly increases the effectiveness of braking. In very simplified terms, the anti-skid system provides the greatest possible brake pressure while not allowing the wheels to lock due to an excessive brake pressure being applied. Without the anti-skid system (manual braking) the braking effectiveness is reduced. \"The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed to provide a slip ratio for maximum braking performance.\" Correct. These systems use a computer that, during ground movement when braking, which constantly compares the measured values of individual wheels (actual rotational speed) with the desired optimum parameters, providing a slip ratio for maximum braking performance. \"If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will be able to achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with anti-skid.\" Incorrect. A pilot will never reach the same performance as a properly functioning anti-skid system. The anti-skid system senses when a brake starts to skid and will reduce braking pressure to avoid the wheels from skidding, a pilot won’t come close to the same performance.",

            "explanation": "“When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm.” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides a constant deceleration during landing on a dry runway. (ignoring possible transition effects when the system begins to function)” CORRECT. The autobrake system varies the brake pressure to achieve a deceleration rate (about 1.7 m/sec2 on the A320 in low autobrake mode). So, when you select “low” autobrake mode in flight, on the landing roll out – it varies the brake pressure to achieve that deceleration rate always. If it is a contaminated runway and it can’t achieve that rate, fundamentally, it will just achieve what it can achieve. “When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed, because maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in the RTO mode.” INCORRECT. I would say that this is a bit type specific. However, saying that the maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in RTO IS NOT CORRECT. => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. The same amount of pressure is accomplished, the only benefit of autobrake is that the braking happens immediately, you do not have to wait for a pilot to respond to it. And, therefore, the braking distance without an autobrake is longer => because of the reaction time. BOTTOM LINE: same deceleration is accomplished, stopping distance in manual braking is greater due to the reaction time.",

The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main hydraulic system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. This is common for large aircraft as their gear are very heavy. Unfortunately, in light aircraft, the gear components are not as heavy, so can get jammed in place with not very much force. This includes the \"blowdown\" system using compressed gasses. The action of emergency gear extension is often a one-way movement, and cannot be reversed. In order to activate the system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through one of the following systems. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. Some emergency extension systems (as mentioned above) use bottles of compressed air or compressed nitrogen to extend the gear, thereby overcoming any small jams that would otherwise keep the gear in the up position. Nitrogen is better as it is non-flammable, and air contains oxygen, which will feed a potential fire. Compressed air is easier (and cheaper) to bottle though. The gear will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical down locks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. The shuttle valve mentioned in this question is a way to feed one actuator with two different pressure sources. When one pressure source loses pressure, the piston can slide across from blocking the emergency source to blocking the usual source, allowing out the emergency pressure to feed the actuator. This can be automatic or manually controlled. A diagram of the shuttle valve is shown in the annex above.",

            "explanation": "Autobrake is a system where the pilots do not press the aircraft brakes at all, the aircraft instead modulates its own brake pressure to maintain a selected rate of deceleration. There are multiple levels of braking available, for progressively shorter runways, requiring a progressively higher rate of deceleration. Anti-skid must be operative for autobrake to work. The autobrake cannot control the aircraft laterally, so it would be really bad if the wheels locked up (on a wet runway without anti-skid), and therefore it cannot be used at all if anti-skid is not available. Autobrakes will be disarmed during use by any of the following conditions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. Otherwise, the autobrake system will continue meeting a selected rate of deceleration until making a complete stop. Whilst one of the other options mentions setting a fixed stopping distance, this is a lot more complex than it sounds, but a system like this has been implemented on newer Airbus A380 and A350 aircraft called BTV (Brake to Vacate). EASA are not yet including this in the learning objectives or questions, so assume it does not exist for the ATPL exams.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. The sidewall is the bit on the side of the tyre that connects the tread to the \"bead\", which is fitted to the wheel rim, it is a very vulnerable section of the tyre, with less protection. Objects embedded in the tyre cause obvious damage to the structural integrity, which could lead to blow outs or slow punctures, both of which are very bad for any ground movements, take off and landing. Note: We are well aware that the pilot should check for both embedded objects and tyre creep when performing their walk around, so would be inclined to appeal this question if it came up in this format. We believe that embedded items are worse than tyre creep, but they should certainly both be checked. Any further exam feedback about this question would be useful to check what EASA are choosing as correct, as well as their choice of options in the future.",

Therefore, We chose to compare them to single disc carbon brakes. The only difference in answer can occur if they compare multi-disc steel brakes to multi-disc carbon brakes directly, in which case the carbon brakes have higher braking strength usually. Please let us know what was actually on the exam if you do see this, and we can adjust it as necessary, thanks! The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them many times, but softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible, and because their wear is more linked to amount of applications, rather than total heat input. In most transport aircraft, the brakes need to absorb vast amounts of heat during landings, rejected take-offs and taxiing, much more than could be absorbed by a single disk and pair of brake pads. Therefore, their brakes are usually made up of multiple (spinning) brake discs separated by multiple (static) rings of brake pads. These multiple rings of stators and rotors can provide much stronger braking and absorb far more heat than a single disc and pair of pads alone, steel or carbon.",

Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe or lead to a ground collision/runway excursion. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. A check of the ply/speed rating, tread depth measurement, and tyre pressure measurement is usually the job of an engineer, and is not required before every single flight, however checking tyre creep and embedded objects are quick enough, and important enough tasks to require a check of every tyre before flight.",

Statement 2: when reverse thrust is activated. Incorrect, the autobrake remains active also when reverse thrust is activated. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Please let us know if you see either in the exam, and whatever you can remember about them, thank you! FLY-BY-WIRE In a Fly-By-Wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, moving the flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which significantly enhances safety. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft can change the effect of control inputs to make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. For instance, in the Airbus A320, above 33°, force is needed to maintain the bank angle. The aircraft will not allow bank angles past 67° in normal law. In this question the bank angle protections have activated improperly at 30° AoB, so more force will be required to maintain or increase the angle of bank.",

            "explanation": "As a fully manual flight control system is reversible the pilot feels all forces acting on the control surfaces in the controls. So the pilot must be able to exert sufficient force to overcome the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This means that flight envelope protection is degraded as avionics no longer limit the pilot input to avoid stall. Should failure conditions prevent operation in Alternate Law, an even more basic Direct Law is available. Autopilot functions are lost, along with flight envelope protection. As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power.

The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting.

Thankfully, this topic is not particularly complicated so the more questions about this, the better. In a fly-by-wire system such as the Airbus A320, amongst others, both pilots have a sidestick which is a major input into the fly-by-wire control system. As these sidesticks are not mechanically linked like other, there needs to be a way for both pilots to make inputs at once. The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own priority button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

            "explanation": "Fly-By-Wire systems A Fly-By-Wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of a late go-around like this one, the recommended way to go around remains the same amongst all aircraft, apply TOGA thrust (or sometimes less if full TOGA thrust is not required), pitch up to a suitable go-around attitude (somewhere around 15° initially), retract flaps if necessary, and begin climbing, then \"clean up\" the rest of the aircraft (gain speed, gear up, retract flaps further, etc.). For that initial reaction though, Fly-By-Wire flight envelope protections could perhaps be useful. Because of the stall protection of a fly-by-wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply TO/GA thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will likely go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), so the aircraft will climb, but the system will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: This would be a very aggressive manoeuvre, and similar to terrain or windshear escape manoeuvres, which would cause the pilots far more issues later on than if they just performed a normal go-around, so this is not the way a pilot should actually fly a go-around in a fly-by-wire aircraft, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing Fly-By-Wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems. Whilst pulling back on the stick with caution is quite advisable (as per one of the other options), it does not need to be gentle, particularly for a late go-around, and it is not to stop the aircraft stalling really, as the Fly-By-Wire stops that.",

Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits.

If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system reduces the rudder deflection for a given rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Incorrect. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced.

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim.

The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own prioirty button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick. Fly-by-wire systems often include safeguards to prevent excessive control inputs that could potentially overstress the aircraft or exceed its performance limits. In the case of dual control inputs, the resulting control input is indeed electronically limited to prevent exceeding the maximum deflection limit of one sidestick.",

            "explanation": "\"I. A gust lock can be used in flight to reduce the effects of turbulence.\" Incorrect. A gust lock is essentially a device which limits the movement of a control surface while the aeroplane is parked, preventing damage when it is unattended. It stops aicraft's surfaces from being slammed back and forth in a strong wind/gusts. Typically it is the ailerons, the elevator and the rudder that are of concern. In many aircraft, the control column that supports the yoke can be immobilized in the cockpit with a heavy pin that slides through aligned holes in the column itself, thereby restarting the elevator and ailerons from moving at all. There is also a style of gust lock that attaches directly to the base of the rudder and holds it immobile. It is clearly essential that all flight control locks are removed/disengaged before flight. \"II. Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock.\" Correct. A reversible control system is a power assisted system in which the pilot is connected directly to the controls, feeling part of the load. It is called \"reversible\" because if someone moves the external surfaces, the stick (or control column) and the peddals move inside the cockpit. Control surfaces move freely and in case of strong wind, for example, they may be slammed back and forth, which may cause aircraft damage. For that reason, a gust lock system should be used, inside the aircraft and/or outside.",

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. This means that flap asymmetry will roll the aircraft towards the cleaner wing (fewer flaps), as the wing with flaps down is producing much more lift than it. It also means that the aircraft will have asymmetric drag, and will want to yaw towards the wing with flaps down, as the flaps are causing extra drag that the clean wing is not producing. This means that the yaw is in the opposite direction from the roll.",

This is to allow for redundancy in the system, and no \"one point of failure\".

Fly-By-Wire is the control system that connects the pilots inputs to the aircraft control surfaces via computers, giving no direct physical connection, but providing benefits such as flight envelope protection and reduced weight of control systems. Flight envelope protection is what is being discussed in this question. An aircraft with fly-by-wire operating in normal law will have a full suite of stall protections. These mean that the system will not let the pilot stall the aircraft by pulling back too hard or too far with the sidestick. It also protects the aircraft from pulling more than the limit load factor. This means that during a terrain escape manoeuvre, when the aim is to gain as much altitude as possible in the shortest distance, the pilot can just pull back on the sidestick to full deflection, and the fly-by-wire system will ensure a controlled pitch up to a high (but safe) pitch angle, allowing the speed to reduce to the point where the aircraft reaches \"max alpha\", and then the aircraft will pitch down to maintain that angle of attack. Whether this is an approved way of performing a terrain escape manoeuvre is irrelevant to the question, which is simply testing your technical knowledge of fly-by-wire systems.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer.",

Secondary flight controls such as flaps, slats, and spoilers often contain maximum speed limits for their use, due to the fact that they stick into the airflow, which will exert significant force on them due to dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure exerted is proportional to the square of the air velocity, so for a doubling of speed, the dynamic pressure increases by x4. If the secondary flight controls were extended past their maximum speed, the devices and the mechanisms keeping them in place could be overpowered or may be permanently damaged. For spoilers, they are subject to huge amounts of dynamic pressure as part of their job \"spoiling\" the airflow over the wing, so are particularly susceptible to this. Note: The spoilers/speedbrakes on an aircraft wing are usually secondary flight controls, but when roll spoilers are active, the roll spoilers are actually classed as primary flight controls because they are acting as ailerons.",

A full stabilizer deflection could prevent the aircraft from returning to a safe landing. A Runaway Pitch Trim can be fatal in flight because it would run the horizontal stabilizer either up or down to its mechanical stops, and the use of the elevators would not be sufficient to overcome this force. In most Electrical Trim systems, two toggle switches are required for a stabilizer trim system, where one of them releases the trim brake and the other one drives the motor. You must use both to activate the stabilizer trim - they are designed in such a way on the control column that if you trim, you will always push them together. The reason you need double trim switches is primarily to prevent Trim Runaway on the stabilizer, if one switch runs away then the other can be used to stop it.",

CORRECT: The zero force position will not change when using pitch (elevator) trim Statement 2: The zero force position of the control wheel does not change when using the aileron trim. INCORRECT: The zero force position will change when using the aileron trim. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Flight controls Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trim wheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Boeing and Airbus call these a bit different but the principle stays the same. Airbus has the following laws: Normal law Flight control Normal Law provides three axis control, flight envelope protection and manoeuver load alleviation. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode, Flight Mode, Flare Mode Alternate law Alternate Law 1 (ALT1) combines Normal Law lateral mode with Alternate Law pitch modes. Low Energy Protection is replaced by Low Speed Stability meaning that the aircraft no longer has automatic stall protection. At low speed, a nose down demand is introduced based on IAS (instead of AOA) and Alternate Law changes to Direct Law. In addition, an audio \"STALL\" warning is introduced. α-Floor protection is not available so conventional pilot stall recovery action is required. Load Factor and Bank Angle Protections are retained. High Speed and High Angle of Attack Protections enter Alternate Law mode. Pitch Attitude Protection is lost. ALT1 control law degradation will result from some faults in the horizontal stabilizer, a single elevator fault, loss of a yaw-damper actuator, loss of slat or flap position sensors or a single air data reference fault. Dependent upon the failure, autopilot may not be available. In Alternate Law 2 (ALT2), Normal Law lateral mode is lost and is replaced by roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch mode is in Alternate Law. Load factor protection is retained. In addition to those protections lost in ALT1 (Pitch Attitude and Low Energy Protection), Bank Angle Protection is also lost. In some failure cases, High Angle of Attack and High Speed Protections will also be lost. As is the case with ALT1, some failure cases that result in ALT2 will also cause the autopilot to disconnect. ALT2 is entered when both engines flame out, with faults in two inertial or two air-data reference units, with faults to all spoilers, certain aileron faults or with a pedal transducers fault Direct law In Direct Law (DIR), lateral modes are the same as ALT2; that is roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch control degrades to Direct Law and automatic trim is inoperative requiring stab trim to be adjusted manually by the pilot. Control surface motion is directly related to the sidestick motion. ALL protections are lost. In Direct Law, autopilot function is always lost. DIR is entered if there is failure of all three inertial reference units or all three primary flight computers, faults in both elevators or flame out of both engines concurrent with loss of PRIM 1. Boeing uses: Normal mode In Normal mode during manual flight, the ACEs receive pilot control inputs and send these signals to the three PFCs. The PFCs verify these signals and utilise information from other airplane systems in order to compute control surface commands. These commands are then sent back to the ACEs which then send the enhanced signals to the flight control surface actuators which convert them into analog servo commands. Full functionality is provided including all enhanced performance, envelope protection and ride quality features. When the autopilot is engaged, the autopilot system sends commands to the PFCs. The PFCs generate control surface commands which are sent to the ACEs in the same manner as pilot control inputs. The autopilot commands move the flight deck controls to provide autopilot feedback to the pilots. If a pilot overrides the autopilot with control inputs, the PFCs will disengage the autopilot and utilise the pilot control inputs. Note that the autopilot is not available should reversion to Secondary or Direct mode occur. Secondary mode Boeing Secondary mode is somewhat similar to the Airbus Alternate Law. When the PFCs cannot support Normal mode operation due to internal faults or to loss of information from other aircraft systems, they automatically revert to Secondary mode. Reversion to Secondary mode results in the loss of the autopilot and the pilots must control the aircraft manually. The ACEs still receive pilot control inputs and send the appropriate signals to the PFCs. However, due to the degraded mode of operation, the PFCs use \"simplified\" computations to generate the flight control surface commands. These commands are sent back to the ACEs from where they are sent to the flight control surfaces in the same manner as during Normal mode operations. Aircraft handling qualities are affected by the simplified computations or PFC control laws that are utilised in Secondary mode. While all flight control surfaces remain operative, the elevator and rudder are more sensitive at some airspeeds. The following functions are inoperative or degraded during Secondary mode operations: autopilot auto speedbrakes envelope protection gust suppression tail strike protection thrust asymmetry compensation yaw damping Direct mode The ACEs automatically revert to Direct mode when they detect the failure of all three PFCs or when they are unable to communicate with the PFCs. Direct mode can also be manually selected by selecting the DISC position on the Primary Flight Computers Disconnect switch. In Direct mode, the PFCs no longer generate control surface commands. Pilot inputs are received by the ACEs and sent directly to the flight control surface actuators. Direct mode allows for full aircraft control while in flight and during the landing phase. Aircraft handling characteristics are very similar to those encountered while in Secondary mode. In addition to those functions lost during Secondary mode operations (as listed previously) the manual rudder trim cancel switch is inoperative.",

Provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, this significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus A320 (the fly-by-wire aircraft most often referenced by EASA), the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, Fly-By-Wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, Their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, Alpha prot. = the aircraft pitch is set so that speed remains at or above this speed, unless the stick is manually pulled back, hence it will automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed if necessary Alpha floor = automatically applies TOGA (full) thrust Alpha max = In normal law, this cannot be exceeded even by maximum stick deflection aft, to avoid a full stall.",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control).

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with even a medium sized flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps/slats from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, which will hydraulically deflect a flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to FBW systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW also enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which, provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft has the ability to change the control inputs to keep the aircraft within its safe flight envelope, and can therefore make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. The system would not override the pilot too much, and in dire situations the pilot may require high bank angles, which would still be possible in a FBW aircraft, as not to degrade safety.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-By-Wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: There is no need for a gust lock on a fully manual flight control system. INCORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power.

They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and Fly-By-Wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals. That would be the case for any irreversible control system, but the rudder pedals would also move if the system were reversible.",

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with a large flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. The figure above shows the allowed deflection of a particular aircraft. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer. The reason that statement 2 is incorrect is that it says the limitations to rudder/rudder pedal deflection occur with decreasing airspeed, but actually it is with increasing airspeed.",

The A320 is a typical example of an aircraft with a FBW system in which all surfaces are actuated hydraulically and are electrically or mechanically controlled. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY (figure 2) Safeguards to eliminate the possibility of loss of control in the event of hydraulic or electrical failure must be provided on modern transport aircraft. This is generally achieved by building some form of redundancy into the control system. Splitting the control surfaces into two or three sections, each powered by separate actuators and hydraulic systems is the usual method. The A320 (EASA's usual favourite aircraft) has 2 actuators per aileron aswell, an active and a \"damping\", which can be used in the event of the failure of the active. Important Note: This question is far too ambiguous about the aircraft in question and the fault that has occured. We have to go to the level of the learning objectives, and try to see what the examiner wants from us. They want us to know that there are multiple computers for each system, so in this event, the system can switch computers, and redundancy in the rest of the system allows us to use a different actuator aswell. This is not true for all FBW aircraft, but going off the feedback, this is what EASA want from us.",

FBW systems can be lighter than a conventional system as FBW does not require the heavy control cables. Including FBW provides a significant reduction in fuel consumption. The FBW systems also provide flight envelope protection by preventing the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack.

Fly-By-Wire flight controls offer many benefits to an aircraft, one of the largest being the addition of flight envelope protection. Provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, this significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, Fly-By-Wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, from automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed (alpha prot.) all the way up to alpha max, which the pilots cannot physically exceed (whilst in normal law). These protections reduce pilot workload, by allowing the pilots to think about things other than flying the aircraft near the stall. This could allow the pilots to complete checks or drills and secure the situation.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-by-wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted (partially powered) control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

            "explanation": "A fully manual flight control system would be a reversible control system, meaning the forces applied on the controls are the forces moving the control surfaces and vice versa. This are connected by mechanical links only and aren’t powered in any way. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Flight spoilers Flight spoilers are fitted on the upper side of the surface of the wing which can be raised. They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

This computer’s output will be the input for an electrically controlled hydro-mechanical unit, a hydraulic motor, which drive the transmission which moves the flaps. The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting. If the main hydraulic system fails, the emergency operation might be via an alternate hydraulic system or an electric motor which operates the same gear train as the normal operating system.",

The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own prioirty button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: A fully manual flight control system should have a gust lock. CORRECT: fully manual flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed.

Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft. Note: Type related questions are out of the scope of ATPL learning objectives.

This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This is the correct answer and to reply to the comments, some aircraft have gust locks in place which prevent the movement of the throttle. So this is what’s meant with take-off is prevented. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls.

Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed inscreases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder peddals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system limits both rudder and rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Correct. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted.",

Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (the same as powered steering in a car). The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals. That would be the case for any irreversible control system, but the rudder pedals would also move if the system were reversible. Therefore, the flight controls on the aircraft described must be fully powered, out of that selection of options.",

Each flap setting has a VFE speed, which is the maximum flaps extended speed. Above this speed, the flaps will take too much load, and could be damaged. Modern jet transport aircraft often have a flap load relief system, which detects flap overspeed, and can disengage the flap lock, allowing the airflow to push the flaps to a lower setting, or some intermediate value, so that the flaps do not get damaged.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.05.05: Explain the concept of a rudder deflection limitation (rudder limiter) system and the various means of implementation (rudder ratio changer, variable stops, blow-back). One of the problems with rudders is that they need to be very large and have a large maximum deflection for adequate directional control in the case of an engine failure during take-off or at low speeds, when there is very little airflow, but if this large rudder had a large deflection at the high cruise speeds of a jet aircraft, it could easily break the tail of the aircraft off with the extreme forces. There are a few methods to remove this problem, rudder ratio changers, variable stops, and blow-back. Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. This rudder ratio changer can be continuous, as described above, or can be a discreet change at a certain airspeed, like changing gears in a car. If this automatic reduction in rudder authority is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Conversely, if the rudder remains in the high-speed, low deflection mode, then there will be insufficient rudder authority to handle engine failures and crosswind landings at low speeds. This means that the approach will have added limitations, such as a higher minimum approach speed and a reduced crosswind limit. The annex above is an extract from the ATR 72 FCOM, an aircraft which does have a discreet rudder ratio changer (called a TLU - Travel Limiting Unit - in the manual) that changes rudder deflection at 180 kts, and the procedure for if a fault occurs. Notice that within the area of the red box, the procedure for if the fault is not resolved (or unsure if resolved) is to increase the VAPP (approach speed) by 10 kt (with associated increased landing distance) and land at an airport with the lowest crosswind, max demonstrated crosswind is 15 kt. To address the other options: The maximum operating speed will not increase, only the minimum. The rudder authority will be less than usual. The flap setting would not need to be greater, as the approach will be faster, so if anything, less flaps may be needed.",

            "explanation": "This question is quite shocking to be honest. The examiner is mixing Boeing and Airbus philosophy. Definitely teaching the wrong thing. But here we go, statement 1 is definitely incorrect: \"1) disengage FBW.\" INCORRECT. FBW describes those flight control systems which use computers to process the flight control inputs made by the pilot or autopilot, and send corresponding electrical signals to the flight control surface actuators. It is definitely not possible to disengage the FBW. \"2) press and hold priority button.\" CORRECT. The sidestick priority logic is only valid when the autopilot is disconnected as it manages who has control when sidestick inputs are made on both sidesticks at the same time. If you press that button at any time it disconnects the autopilot. Press and hold it you have priority. Computers will disregard the other sidestick’s inputs. Press it continuously for 40 secs and it permanently locks the other sidestick out unless the other pilot presses his button. \"3) disengage on MCP.\" CORRECT. I believe they might be referring to the A/P disengage bar which is found on the MCP of Boeing airplanes. If you press this bar down, the A/P disengages. \"4) forcefully move the control column.\" CORRECT. This is known as column or wheel force override and is present in some aircraft, especially small aircraft.",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trim wheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

In a Fly-By-Wire system such as the Airbus A320, amongst others, both pilots have a sidestick which is a major input into the Fly-By-Wire control system. As these sidesticks are not mechanically linked like others, there needs to be a known output for if both pilots make inputs at once. The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, and a lasting visual indication of some kind (in this case, a red arrow on the sidestick priority light) indicating the active sidestick.",

They stop the flight control surfaces from being moved at all, and are meant for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds. The wind could move the control surfaces all the way to their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit controls they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed, to avoid the chance of taking off with control locks engaged.

Usually this autoslat function has some conditions before it will function which can be airspeed, flaps and slats settings. When the stall condition ceases the autoslat system will retract the slats.

When using the elevator (pitch) trim, the entire horizontal tail moves and therefore the zero force point will stay the same. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Note: We think that the different authorities have different versions of this question. Some mention that it is a Fly By Wire aircraft, some saying Airbus, and some saying specifically A320. It is the same answer for all these, and EASA are usually talking about A320s when they mention Fly By Wire anyway. We think the questions are similar enough to warrant only this one in the bank, but if further feedback says otherwise, we will add separate questions. Fly By Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of Fly By Wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. This question used to be very ambiguous, but over the past year it has changed a few times, and now we know it is an Airbus (we believe it says A320 in some exam authorities) and it is flying at the critical angle of attack. As it is at its critical angle of attack, pulling back on the sidestick would make it initially attempt to climb, but as this would further increase the angle of attack and slow the aircraft, the flight envelope protections would step in and stop this pitching backwards. Therefore the only thing that can save us from this scenario is actually adding thrust. This will allow us to increase our speed, decreasing our AoA, and subsequently, the flight controls will allow us to begin a climb. This is the only way to induce any sort of climb from the very low energy state of the question. In fact, the Airbus A320 actually has a set of limiting angles of attack, where different measures will be taken one by one to stop an impending stall. One of those measures is automatically applying TO/GA (Take off/Go around) thrust. You are not expected to know this for the question, so do not assume that the aircraft will automatically do this if you keep pulling back. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.03.05: Explain the operating principle of rudder and aileron trim in a fully powered control system. There are two basic types of flight controls, reversible and irreversible. Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor is that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against, the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. There are pros and cons to both, but one benefit of irreversible controls such as fly by wire, is that trimming can be made easier. All a simple trim system needs to do is adjust where the system considers the \"zero\" point to be. Therefore the rudder (in this case) will sit naturally at the new \"zero\" point, which will produce a constant trim in a particular direction. Pitch trim can differ from this method though, and some manufacturers take their own stance on trimming, such as if the rudder pedals are supposed to move with the trim or not, etc.",

These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of severe windshear, the recommended way to gain altitude and escape the windshear is to apply maximum thrust and pitch up to a high attitude until reaching near the stall speed, then maintain that speed. In theory, a Fly-By-Wire aircraft can actually perform some of that for the pilot. Because of the stall protection of a Fly-By-Wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply full thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), but will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: this is not the way an Airbus pilot should actually fly a windshear escape manoeuvre, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing fly-by-wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems.",

CORRECT: If an aircraft would take off with a gust lock engaged one or more flight controls would not work. Statement 2: Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock. CORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

The answer to this question does seem a little counter-intuitive initially, but remember that the question is really asking about the advantages of fly-by-wire aircraft's redundancy elements. As Fly-By-Wire control systems have no manual back-up systems, and flight controls can be lost due to loss of power, loss of computers, loss of hydraulics, etc., they have multiple redundant systems to prevent this. In reality, they end up having more redundancy than some simpler systems, in the amount of separate systems that can be used as backups. For this question then, the correct answer is actually that FBW aircraft benefit from increased damage tolerance. Now we strongly believe that it very much depends on the type of damage and its location, but when you consider that FBW aircraft usually have 3 hydraulic systems and 3-4 flight control computers, you can see where the examiner is coming from. That is more redundant systems than simpler aircraft would usually have.",

Keep in mind that the stall speed grows proportionally to the square root of the load factor. Thus, in this situation, there is a heightened risk of stalling (and entering a spin) if prompt action is not taken, given the diminishing margin to the stall speed. In all cases of asymmetric flap, the wing with the greater amount of flap extended is producing a substantially higher amount of lift. At the same time, increased drag on the flaps-down side creates a pronounced adverse yaw situation, with the nose swinging toward the wing with most flaps deflected.",

Slats Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed-wing aircraft which, when deployed, allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack. At high angles of attack they allow the air over the wing to have much greater energy, allowing the aircraft to fly at much higher angles of attack without stalling. This allows the wing to produce a higher maximum coefficient of lift, and can therefore fly slower whilst still balancing the weight force with lift. Slats, like flaps, are therefore used for take-off, landing and slow flight, thereby reducing take-off and landing distances. Slats are still retracted for normal flight as they increase drag, similar to flaps. They are hydraulically powered, just like the flaps and other flight controls on large aircraft. Some aircrafts are equipped with an Auto-Slat System. This system enhances the airplane stalling characteristics. Upon receiving a signal from the stall warning system that the aircraft is close to the stall (high AoA), the auto-slat system automatically operates the slats, extending them from the midrange position to the fully extended landing position. The slats retract a few seconds after the signal is removed. This is a bit like a \"get out of jail free\" card, and allows a few extra degrees angle of attack before the wing completely stalls.",

Some aircraft have a ditching mode which will close all valves to avoid water flowing into the cabin in the event of a forced landing on water. The outflow valves are fitted with two AC motors, these are used with automatic control, and one DC motor for manual or emergency operation. When the pressure is controlled manually all automatic functions will be disabled and enables the outflow valves to be positioned with the DC motor. So manual mode has a separate circuit for the operation.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

The valve being open is as if you have a broken window, and losing your cabin pressurisation (basically decompression is taking place). Eventually, the cabin pressure will end up equalising the ambient pressure. At this point, the cabin rate of descent will equal the rate of descent of the aircraft. Differential pressure: Decreases The difference between the cabin pressure and the outside pressure at high altitude is getting closer towards equalising, if it is not to be stoped. Eventually, the differential pressure will be 0. Cabin Pressure - Ambient Outside Pressure = Differential Pressure",

Pressurization System control methods The way the pressure in the aircraft is controlled is by having a constant mass of air entering the cabin through the airconditioning system. This mass of air is kept constant by the mass flow controller. The pressure is regulated by the amount of air which is discharged back to the atmosphere by the outflow valves. So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential. These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed.",

The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control.

These usually use bleed air that has been taken from that side engine's compressor, thereby having a left pack which runs from left engine bleed air, and a right pack which runs off air from the right hand engine(s). The APU also feeds bleed air into the pneumatic system (usually to the left side). In the air, the system should operate normally with no interaction between the left and right side. There is an isolation valve between the two systems to either make them interconnected or completely separate. This is usually open on the ground when the engines are off to provide APU bleed air to both packs for cooling and to both engines for starting. It is closed in the air for split operation, unless an abnormal situation occurs, such as a loss of engine bleed air, pack failure, etc., when the isolation valve will either automatically be opened or the flight crew will open it to balance the load within the system. A significant pressure difference between the two sides of an isolation valve in the air is likely to mean that one of the sides has an issue that the other does not have. In the case of the Boeing 737 specifically (image shown above), the isolation valve opens automatically if any of the pack or engine bleed switches are NOT in their normal locations (bleeds on, packs auto) as the system knows that the pneumatics will become unbalanced in that case (bleed off, pack off, or pack set to high flow, etc.). It can be manually forced open or closed though by positioning the switch each side of the \"AUTO\" position. It is not good to feed bleed air into a leaky duct, though, so that is something to be careful of with pressure differentials. As for the other options: \"They close when the system pressure equals the environmental pressure.\" This is talking roughly about the pressurisation outflow valve. That is what controls the pressure in the cabin. \"They open when there is a leak in one of the systems.\" This is a bad thing, as we do not want to feed hot bleed air into a leaky air duct, due to overheating and potential loss of pressurisation. \"They close when the engines are at maximum thrust.\" Engines at high thrust produce more bleed air, but they will produce it to both sides of the pneumatic manifold, so isolation valve open or closed, it shouldn't make too much difference.",

            "explanation": "There are two types of air conditioning systems commonly used on aircraft. Air cycle air conditioning is used on most turbine-powered aircraft. It makes use of engine bleed air or APU pneumatic air during the conditioning process. Another system is electrically powered air conditioning which can be found in Boeing 787. Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Reduced fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no guidance on whether the initial cost of the electric-pneumatic system is cheaper than similar bleed air systems, and any engine system that reduced the take off distance would increase (not reduce) the climb gradient. The change in de-icing capabilities depends on the system. Ease of use also depends on the system. Bleed air pneumatic systems are quite easy to use so the difference will be minimal if there is one.",

Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft).

The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

These gauges are often combined in some way to take up less space and be easier to read by pilots. In additional to these parameters there should be a visual and aural warning when the cabin exceeds an altitude of 10 000 ft.",

Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 and 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude. Control. Achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

So as in the atmosphere the pressure drops with altitude, an increase in cabin altitude means a drop in cabin pressure. The differential pressure equals: cabin pressure – ambient pressure. So the difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure. Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10 000 ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000 ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500 ft/min for the climb and 300 ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

In piston engine aircraft, different sources of air supply can be used, such as compressors, blowers or vacuum pumps. Those devices are driven by small electrical motors or directly by the engine and provide air for some instruments, de-icing and cabin. Compressors are able to handle more air while blowers and vacuum systems are used for lower demands. Ram air turbine may be used on larger aircraft as a backup hydraulic power source. Bleed air provides air supply for a gas turbine engine. Turbocharger is not necessarily running all the time and therefore would be of no use as air supply. Note: Superchargers can be used to provide pneumatic pressure, as they are effectively the same thing as an air compressor, just one that is usually used to provide extra Manifold Pressure to the engine intake air. This is why some textbooks and questions do refer to them as possible pneumatic pressure sources, but compressor pump is much more correct than turbocharger here, as turbochargers are not always working in an engine.",

Locate the value of 38 000 ft in the first column on the left => continue horizontally to the right and read the corresponding pressure 2.99 PSI. The maximum allowed pressure differential is 8.17 PSI - that means that the cabin pressure is \"outside air pressure (2.99) + differential pressure (8.17)= 11.16 PSI\" Cabin altitude corresponding to 11.16 psi is found by interpolating 7000-8000 ft and 11.34-10.92 PSI. For the 0.42 PSI change between 11.34 PSI (7000 ft) and 10.92 (8000 ft) PSI, the change in altitude is 1000 ft in total. So each 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft. We can calculate 11.16 PSI cabin pressure based on 11.34 PSI or 10.92 PSI. Let's base it on 11.34 PSI. The difference between this and the cabin pressure we calculated is 0.18 (11.34 - 11.16) PSI. Since every 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft, a change of 0.18 PSI causes an altitude change of 429 ft (23.81 x 18). If we add this value to our base altitude (7000 ft), the result is 7429 ft. (We added it because the altitude increases as the PSI decreases) The closest answer is 7430 ft.",

As both would actually be covered by the same correct answer, there is no problem. We strongly believe that it is talking about pressure control, but we can cover all bases here anyway. Temperature control of the air conditioning system in a jet transport aircraft comes from controlling the mixing of two streams of air - hot and cold - whch come from different stages of the bleed air conditioning packs. Some aircraft have automatic valves to control the internal temperature of the air, if this does not work, the valve can sometimes be manually controlled from the flight deck. This all depends on the aircraft type of course. PRESSURISATION SYSTEMS Cabin pressurization is achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. The operation of the outflow valves is governed by the pressure controller when in automatic control => as the cabin pressure changes, the controller automatically transmits a signal to the outflow valves. If the automatic control fails, the position of the outflow valve can be controlled by the flight crew in manual mode => the outflow valve position can be varied by means of the main outflow valve control and with reference to the cabin altitude gauge and the valve position indicator.",

            "explanation": "Be aware of wat the terms mean, cabin altitude means the pressure inside the aircraft equivalent to an altitude. So as in the atmosphere the pressure drops with altitude, an increase in cabin altitude means a drop in cabin pressure. The differential pressure equals: cabin pressure – ambient pressure. So the difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure. With a drop in cabin pressure the difference between the cabin pressure and ambient pressure will decrease. Pressurization As modern aircraft operate more efficiently at high altitudes, it is necessary to pressurize the cabin to allow the crew and passengers to function normally without the need for additional oxygen. Up to an altitude of 10000ft the air pressure is sufficient for humans to operate without any issues. Above this altitude the lack of oxygen can become an issue for the performance of the crew and the wellbeing of the passengers. Most commercial air transport aircraft have the cabin pressurized to an equivalent of 8000ft or less. Because the pressurization of the aircraft it is also possible to perform high rates of descent while the change in pressure in the cabin is a lot lower. Cabin rates of climb and descent should be monitored and should normally not exceed 500ft/min for the climb and 300ft/min for the descent. Typical maximum pressure differential for commercial aircraft are between 8 and 9 psi.",

            "explanation": "This is sneaky, they are asking about the indication in the cabin of a bleed air duct leak. Therefore, the usual (and very easy) answer of the bleed air duct leak indicator light is no longer correct, because there is no such light in the cabin, only in the flight deck. The bleed air in the pneumatic system is usually fed from a \"bleed air source\" in a gas turbine engine, which is effectively just air that has already gone through some of the compressor stages and is siphoned off to pressurise the system (not burnt). It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. Thankfully, it is usually kept far away from passengers, for just this reason, so the first sign of a duct leak in the cabin would likely be reduction in airflow coming through the vents. This is because less air is fed into the air conditioning packs (as some of it has leaked out), so less air is able to be cooled and sent to the cabin vents. The cabin pressure will not drop rapidly as the loss of pressurisation is small, depending on the location of the duct leak, and the outflow valve will close naturally to keep the remaining pressure inside. It could be argued that the cabin temperature could rise above normal limits, but this is highly dependent on the location of the leak. The majority of the bleed air lines exist in the wings and underbelly of the aircraft (mostly unpressurised areas) so the chance of the passenger cabin being heated by this is quite slim, but some aircraft equipment could certainly be damaged.",

Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 an 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude. According to the table provided, at 41 000 ft the pressure is approx 2.59 psi.

Most aircraft are equipped with a defroster consisting of vents that direct heated air across the windshield on the inside of the cabin. To prevent ice formation, most windshields are electrically heated: small wires or electrically conductive materials are embedded in the windshield or in a panel of glass installed over the exterior of the windshield. By passing electric current through the windshield or panel, sufficient heat is produced to prevent ice formation. OTHER ICE CONTROL SYSTEMS.

Hot air anti-ice systems are installed on most turbojet and some turboprop aeroplanes.

This is \"bleed\" air, which is taken from the high pressure, hot air in the engine compressors.

Wing leading edges: These can be fed by hot bleed air, but require much greater volumes of bleed air than the engine cowlings, so are more commonly used as a \"de-icing\" system, where ice that has already formed can be removed.",

On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft.

Some airplanes don't need the horizontal stabilizer to have anti-ice because it was shown during flight testing that there were no adverse effects from having ice on the tail. This is mainly because the horizontal stabilizer/elevator has been designed so that even with a degradation of lift due to the ice, it still produces a sufficient tail down force to maintain control, even when approaching the stall speed.",

On some airframes it is better to anti-ice the wing leading edges aswell, especially if using a weeping wing design like on many light aircraft. As for this question, the answers beginning with \"prevents\" are correct (anti-icing rather than de-icing), and the ice does not form on the trailing edge of a wing (it can flow over the trailing edge in extreme cases but does not \"form\" there), so therefore the correct answer has to be that it \"prevents the formation of ice on engine inlets.\"",

Some aircraft are fitted with ice detection systems which show the pilots a warning when ice acccumulation has been detected, often on a small probe. Some aircraft rely simply on visual references, such as the buildup of ice on the windshield wipers, or other items within view of the pilots. This is a design consideration of the aircraft, and the pilots must be able to see indications of ice accretion as they occur, particularly in large jet aircraft where the pilot cannot see the wing easily.

The detector monitors pressure differential between the two edges. In flight under normal conditions, the holes remain open and, consequently, the pressure differential is zero. In icing conditions, holes in the leading edge rapidly become blocked by ice. This causes a change in the pressure differential - a decrease in dynamic pressure is sensed, causing the relay unit to give a warning. A heater element is fitted around the tube to dissipate accumulated ice, which heats up the small holes first causing the indications to turn off.",

On many reciprocating-engine and turboprop airplanes, de-icing boots are pneumatically inflated for a few seconds to break the ice, which allows it to be carried away by the airstream. A high-pressure de-icing boot is a fabric-reinforced rubber sheet that contains built in inflation tubes. The boots are installed in sections along each leading-edge surface. This system can be triggered from the flight deck. In another system, primarily used by turbine-powered aeroplanes, heated air is directed through ducting in the aerofoil leading edge, to thermally prevent ice from forming. This is referred to as thermal anti-ice system. Note: Pneumatic de-icing boots do not prevent ice formation, these are de-icing systems only.",

Applying similar liquids to airframe surfaces in flight can have comparable benefits. These systems are usually called weeping wings and typically protect wings, tail surfaces, propellers and windshields. Modern systems use leading edge panels that are either laser drilled with thousands of small holes, or fitted with fine stainless steel mesh. In operation, a pump forces a mixture of ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and water through the holes. This fluid runs back over the surface, forming a thin liquid film that prevents structural ice from forming. The anti-icing fluid is stored in a reservoir that holds enough fluid to provide two or more hours of ice protection when flying in moderate icing conditions.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap. It is incorrect because flaps can be made as strong as you like. They could manage up to +15G if the manufacturer wants to. There are minimum values to their strength though, defined in the certification specifications.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate.

Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

They keep track of all the maintenance work that has been done on the plane, including any repairs or inspections related to its structure. By looking at these documents, the pilot can see if everything has been properly taken care of according to the rules and guidelines. One of these documents is the aircraft's tech log, which is used to record the operational status of an aircraft. It serves as a detailed record of the aircraft's flights, maintenance activities, and any reported issues or discrepancies. \"Speak to a maintenance engineer\" Incorrect: While speaking to a maintenance engineer can provide valuable insights and guidance regarding the aircraft's condition, it may not always be feasible or practical for a pilot to consult with an engineer directly, especially in time-sensitive situations. Additionally, relying solely on verbal communication may not offer the comprehensive documentation and verification needed to ensure the integrity of the aircraft's structure. \"Review the flight crew's credentials\" Incorrect: Reviewing the flight crew's credentials is essential for ensuring that qualified personnel are operating the aircraft. However, it doesn't directly address the structural integrity of the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.01.02.01.01: Explain how stress and strain are always present in an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times.",

The life of such a structure can be defined in different ways, cycles, flight hours, pressurization events or calendar time. After this interval has been reached the structure should be replaced, inspected or overhauled per manufacturers recommendations. Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulphur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. The salt from the oceans is a large factor in this. Flying close to warm oceanic surfaces (low level over the tropical seas) is probably the worst possible environment for corrosion, due to the warm, humid, salty air.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The rate of corrosion is the speed at which any given metal deteriorates in a specific environment. The performance of atmospherically exposed metals depends on five main factors: temperature, humidity, rainfall, Sulphur dioxide (pollution) concentration in the air, and air salinity. Temperature - an increase in temperature will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. A rule of thumb is that temperature increases of 10°C will double the corrosion rate. Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulphur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. Redundancy means that there are more than one systems which can do the same task in case one or more fail. That’s why modern aircraft usually have 2 or even 3 hydraulic systems which can take over the functions of the other in case it fails.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan. This question simply wants you to know that there are constantly loads of all types occuring on an aircraft at all times. static loads also occur whilst in flight, and dynamic loads occur on the ground, even when parked (wind, boarding, etc.), so the two statements are both incorrect.",

Unfortunately, the wording makes this question rather difficult to answer at all, and the answer we evaluated as \"most correct\" is not correct in the exams. Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

Strain: This is an external force which acts on a structure of sufficient magnitude that the structural dimensions change.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",
