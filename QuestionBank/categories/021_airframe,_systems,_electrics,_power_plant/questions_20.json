The aim of FADEC computer controls the engines by reading all input and output parameters of engines themselves and the required performance requested by flight crew. It controls the engine to run efficiently with full control of the system. It also reduces pilot workload by making the engine control and monitoring much easier. Since the authority of FADEC is very extensive, losing the correct operation may cause loss of engine control, therefore to ensure sufficient redundancy, each engine is normally equipped with two FADEC computers, and two of any essential components or sensors, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. As a result, the engines will continue to operate normally should a single component from one of the FADEC systems fail in flight. Therefore, FADEC engines are \"single-fault tolerant\".",

To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic.

To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link.

It captures the required air mass flow and delivers it to the compressor at the correct design speed. That’s why the intake is slightly divergent in order to reduce the airflow’s velocity (=dynamic pressure) and increase the static pressure and temperature just before the fan and compressor’s first stages. Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers.",

Therefore, there is no change in speed or pressure across them, only a change in direction. Therefore, correct option: CORRECT, INCORRECT IMPORTANT NOTE: These questions have led to a lot of confusion over the years. Please note that we received initial feedback from students confirming that the correct answer was \"incorrect, incorrect.\" Based on this, we had believed that according to EASA, nozzle guide vanes formed slightly convergent ducts, resulting in pressure drops. However, we have received more recent feedback from Hungary and Slovakia, confirming that the correct answer is \"correct, incorrect.\" It appears that EASA may have recently rectified this question to align with what we now believe to be the correct answer.",

The feedback wasn't exact about the wording either, so please do let us know if you see this in the exam, and anything you can remember for it, as it could be quite differently worded there, thank you! HALON Halon is the substance which is still most widely used agent for aviation purposes, being the most effective fire extinguishing agent. Halon compounds (such as BCF and BTM) are the most widely used for engine fire fighting. Halon variants work by a combination of chemical and physical effects. The chemical effects, which are dominant in their overall effect, are achieved by the atoms in the gas directly inhibiting combustion. These fire extinguishers release bromine radicals when heated, which bind to the burning substance instead of oxygen, interrupting the process of combustion. An advantage of Halon is that it is not corrosive on aluminium. Halon is also good because it can be used in enclosed spaces without severely harming anyone present. Whilst it is best to don protective breathing equipment when fighting a fire or using an extinguisher, halon is very low toxicity, so not very harmful to humans.",

They are inherently more reliable than single indication fire detection systems, as the loops run together, and if both of them indicate a fire, the indication is much more likely to be correct. They operate using an AND logic gate, so both have to indicate a fire to be taken as a fire warning. This avoids quite common false positive indications that could happen on single loop systems. If a loop is crushed during operation, then - depending very slightly on the type of loop - the system will likely register a fire/overheat/error on that loop, but that makes no difference as the other loop (Loop B) is not registering a fire. Therefore, there will be no indication at the time (not even a fault indication), and the system automatically acts as a single loop system, based on whether loop B detects a fire or not. That is what the correct answer means about the system \"operating as normal\", but we would say it's not exactly normal, as it's a single loop system now. Depending on the MEL (Minimum Equipment List) of the aircraft/operator, flights can be undertaken with one loop broken before flight, as the system can change its logic from requiring both indications to just one (it can run as a single loop system). This is effectively the same as if a loop fails in flight, and does obviously reduce the reliability of the system though, so the crew must be careful in doing this.",

Therefore, if loop B was crushed, upon testing it, no fire indication would be given, and this is the primary indication that loop B is inoperative. In this case, most aircraft can still be dispatched with just loop A operative, but the dual loop system becomes a single loop system and could give false indications if loop A also becomes faulty. The \"test warning light\" mentioned in the question either indicates that the test is taking place or that the test has failed, unfortunately, that would be far too type specific and with this wording, we can't say which is correct, either way it would show in this case. Another minor problem with this question is that fire detection systems act differently after being crushed, dependent on the type used, but nevertheless, the fire test should be able to detect the issue and not provide the fire bell/warning upon test of a faulty loop.",

The question is quite vague about the engine fire notification, it could be anything from a passenger seeing some flames to a fire warning bell in the flight deck. Nonetheless, the first thing to do is remain calm and identify the malfunction methodically to make sure the indication is correct and agree the problem, whilst making sure to fly the aircraft as number 1 priority (aviate, navigate, communicate). The worst case scenario here is that either of the pilots rush and shut down/extinguish the wrong engine, so it is important to both agree on which engine has a problem, and what that problem is. Then the relevant memory items and checklist can be performed (which will include shutting down the engine and discharging the fire extinguisher).",

The sensing element is a thermistor device. It is a small diameter tube filled with a thermistor material in which is embedded a wire running the full length. The thermistor changes electrical resistance with temperature – as the temperature goes up, the resistance goes down; and the current flow/leakage will increase along the loop. The resistance is measured between the wire and the tube by means of an electrical connector at each end. After the temperature drops (fire is extinguished) the wire will stop conducting and the system is reset and can be used again. In today’s transport, dual loop systems are generally employed to engine fire zones, both loops must be triggered to activate the fire warning. The system is AC supplied and has the ability to continue functioning with a single wire break. If the two loops of an engine fire detection system detect a low resistance and a low capacity, the loops are faulty.",

Double-loop fire detection systems can either be the capacitance/resistance type, or the gas filled detector type.

Depending on the MEL (Minimum Equipment List) of the aircraft/operator, flights can be undertaken with one loop broken, as the system can change its logic from requiring both indications to just one (it can run as a single loop system).

The sensing element is a thermistor device. It is a small diameter tube filled with a thermistor material in which is embedded a wire running the full length. The thermistor changes electrical resistance with temperature – as the temperature goes up, the resistance goes down; and the current flow/leakage will increase along the loop. The resistance is measured between the wire and the tube by means of an electrical connector at each end. After the temperature drops (fire is extinguished) the wire will stop conducting and the system is reset and can be used again. In today’s transport, dual loop systems are generally employed to engine fire zones, both loops must be triggered to activate the fire warning. The system is AC supplied and has the ability to continue functioning with a single wire break. If the two loops of an engine fire detection system detect a low resistance and a low capacity, the loops are faulty.",

The sensing element consists of a stainless steel tube that is filled with an inert gas and a gas absorbing material. The gas filled tube reacts to the heat during a fire. The built up pressure, due to the fire making the gas expand, activates the detector when a predetermined value is reached. A leak in the system causes the gas pressure to drop, resulting in a fault alert. An advantage of this system is that a leak will not trigger a false fire warning. Testing of the gas-filled loop system involves heating up the gas-fille container to the predetermined temperature at which gas pressure will trigger the fire warning.

            "explanation": "Hydrophobic seal coatings serve as an alternative to chemical repellents, also providing the ability to ensure that rain beads up and falls off naturally, providing the pilots with enhanced visibility during wet conditions. Such systems are common to modern aircraft, as their treatment lasts for a long period of time and is quite effective at liquid removal. The manufacturer’s coating process deeply penetrates the windshield surface providing hydrophobic action for a relative long period of time. Despite its longevity, hydrophobic rain repellent systems take more time and effort to restore when their effectiveness begins to decline. The effect is similar to the chemical repellent, the differences being that hydrophobic coating last longer (while repellents usually need to be applied more than once during a flight) but coating restoration requires more effort (compared to refilling the repellent tanks). The hydrophobic windshield coating reduces the need for wipers but it is not an alternative to the use of windshield wipers. The hydrophobic seal is not heat activated.",

The sensing element is a thermistor device. It is a small diameter tube filled with a thermistor material in which is embedded a wire running the full length. The thermistor changes electrical resistance with temperature – as the temperature goes up, the resistance goes down; and the current flow/leakage will increase along the loop. The resistance is measured between the wire and the tube by means of an electrical connector at each end. After the temperature drops (fire is extinguished) the wire will stop conducting and the system is reset and can be used again. In today’s transport, dual loop systems are generally employed to engine fire zones, both loops must be triggered to activate the fire warning. The system is AC supplied and has the ability to continue functioning with a single wire break. If the two loops of an engine fire detection system detect a low resistance and a low capacity, the loops are faulty.",
