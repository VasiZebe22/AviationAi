It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. RA is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of this system despite possible conflicting ATC instructions. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, nonetheless pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology.",

Each circling situation is different because of variables such as runway layout, final approach track, wind velocity and meteorological conditions. Therefore, there can be no single procedure designed that will cater for conducting a circling approach in every situation. 7.2.2 After initial visual contact, the basic assumption is that the runway environment should be kept in sight while at minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) for circling.

When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane.

            "explanation": "The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) or Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) was developed in order to reduce the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft. It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the ACAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during an ACAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. When there is a collision danger between two aircraft, the ACAS systems of these aircraft will inform the pilots in the form of Resolution Advisory (RA) giving them instructions to follow. The ACAS systems of the two aircraft are communicating with each other in order to provide the pilots with non-contradicting instructions (i.e. one aircraft may instructed to climb and the other to descend). The ATC is usually unaware of the onset of a Resolution Advisory (RA) and the respective instructions given to the pilots. That is the reason why after following the Resolution Advisory (RA), the pilot shall notify the ATC as soon as possible. Note: After the response to an ACAS RA is completed, a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated. (ICAO Doc 4444)",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The regulation does not refer to “heights”, only “altitudes” and “flight levels” altitudes, for flights at or below the transition altitude. - CORRECT. See regulation below. altitudes, for flights at or below the lowest usable flight level. - WRONG. What makes this option incorrect is the fact that it states “AT OR below”, when the regulation only says “BELOW”. flight levels, for flights in and above the transition layer. - WRONG. See regulation below. Rules of the air, annex 2 CHAPTER 3. GENERAL RULES 3.1.3 Cruising levels The cruising levels at which a flight or a portion of a flight is to be conducted shall be in terms of: a) flight levels, for flights at or above the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, above the transition altitude; b) altitudes, for flights below the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, at or below the transition altitude. Note.— The system of flight levels is prescribed in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services — Aircraft Operations (Doc 8168). ICAO Doc 4444 1- For flights in the vicinity of aerodromes and within terminal control areas the vertical position of aircraft shall, except as provided for in 4.10.1.2, be expressed in terms of altitudes at or below the transition altitude and in terms of flight levels at or above the transition level. While passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when climbing and in terms of altitudes when descending. Note: We are aware that some databases may have a different correct option, which is as follows: “altitudes, for flights below the lowest usable flight level”. We do not have that option, instead we have one which states: “AT OR Below” => making it incorrect. Note: We suggest appealing this question if you come across it because one could argue that there are 2 possible correct answers. If you come see it in your official exams, further feedback would be highly appreciated.",

Different modes of operation are applicable for parallel runways, and they are defined by a mode number that specifies the type of operation being carried out. Mode 1: Independent Parallel Approaches Independent parallel approaches involve simultaneous adjacent approaches to parallel instrument runways. ATS surveillance system separation minima between aircraft using adjacent published instrument approach procedures are not applied on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 1 is labeled as independent and indicates that the operations on one runway are completely unrelated to those on the other. Mode 2: Dependent Parallel Approaches Dependent parallel approaches involve adjacent aircraft making simultaneous instrument approaches to parallel runways, with radar separation applied longitudinally and laterally between the aircraft on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 2 (dependent) functions similarly, but with the inclusion of radar separation, resulting in operations on one runway being reliant on those on the other. Mode 3: Independent Parallel Departures Aircraft depart from the parallel runways at the same time. Mode 4: Segregated Parallel Operations One runway is used for departures while the other is used for approaches.

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. Resolution Advisory (RA) means a warning to the flight crew of an imminent collision threat, combined with commands for the crew to use in avoiding an airborne collision. It will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane. Pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls, using the standard phraseology (refer to the attached figure).",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The aircraft is executing an approach to runway 22 followed by a visual manoeuvering (circling) to runway 04. When visual reference is lost, the pilot should initially make a climbing turn towards the landing runway, which is runway 04.

Aviation regulations and best practices always prioritize the safety of the aircraft, crew, and passengers over other considerations, including noise abatement (safety first). When a pilot communicates a safety concern, such as needing a longer runway for takeoff in adverse weather conditions, ATC will typically accommodate this request if it is operationally feasible. While noise abatement procedures are important for minimizing the impact of aircraft noise on surrounding communities, they are secondary to ensuring the safety of flight operations. Therefore, ATC is expected to provide a clearance for the safer option, which in this case is runway 24, as safety considerations take precedence over noise abatement procedures.",

Aircraft flying in the same region are using the same QNH (given by ATC) as an altimeter setting when flying below the transition altitude. This allows the pilots to report their altitude based on the same reference pressure point, and also allows the ATC to provide separation between them. When flying above the transition altitude, all aircraft are using the standard pressure setting of 1013.2 hPa. Below the transition altitude, vertical separation is provided by assigning different altitudes to the aircraft.

ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS-ATM) 4.11.2 Contents of voice position reports 4.11.2.1 The position reports required by 4.11.1.1 and 4.11.1.2 shall contain the following elements of information, except that elements d), e) and f) may be omitted from position reports transmitted by radiotelephony, when so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements: a) aircraft identification; b) position; c) time; d) flight level or altitude, including passing level and cleared level if not maintaining the cleared level; e) next position and time over; and f) ensuing significant point. 4.11.2.1.1 Element d), flight level or altitude, shall, however, be included in the initial call after a change of air-ground voice communication channel. 4.11.2.2 When assigned a speed to maintain, the flight crew shall include this speed in their position reports. The assigned speed shall also be included in the initial call after a change of air-ground voice communication channel, whether or not a full position report is required. Note.— Omission of element d) may be possible when flight level or altitude, as appropriate, derived from pressure-altitude information can be made continuously available to controllers in labels associated with the position indication of aircraft and when adequate procedures have been developed to guarantee the safe and efficient use of this altitude information. This last note tells us that we can omit the aircraft level from the position report if Mode C is serviceable and in use (with a suitable controller who has access to the SSR display, of course, but this can be assumed based on the other answers). Therefore, the position report of: Bigjet 337, MAVEK 47, FL280, ATTEK 57 Can become: Bigjet 337, MAVEK 47, ATTEK 57",

The least accurate of these specifications is RNAV 10 (RNP 10), as the number in the specification refers to the minimum accuracy over 95% of the time of operation. RNAV 10 and RNP 10 are the same thing, in case you have not already studied RNAV. NAT Doc. 007 16.5.5 - For flights which intend to operate through the New York Oceanic East or West, or Santa Maria Oceanic FIRs, RNAV 10 (RNP 10) or RNP- 4 approval is required in order to benefit from the reduced lateral separations employed here. Any NAT HLA aircraft intending to fly within these airspaces should ensure that its RNP approval status is also included in the flight plan. Specifically such operators should annotate ICAO flight plan Item 10 (Equipment) with the letter “R” and annotate Item 18 (Other Information) with, as appropriate, “PBN/A1 (for RNAV 10 (RNP 10) approval) or PBN/L1 (for RNP 4 approval)” (see Chapter 4).

Conditions applicable to the use of this procedure are contained in Section 5.9. Looking at the options above and the annex, it is clear that VFR flights are not legally required to be separated from other VFR flights in any airspace. Therefore, at all times, the pilot in command of a VFR flight is responsible for their own traffic separation. Whilst you could argue that some scenarios would make ATC also responsible for traffic separation, that is only with aircraft under certain flight rules, not all aircraft, and certainly not in all VFR approach scenarios.

Note.— See Chapter 11, 11.4.3.2.1. 4.8.4 An ATC unit receiving notification of an aircraft’s intention to change from IFR to VFR flight shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, so inform all other ATS units to whom the IFR flight plan was addressed, except those units through whose regions or areas the flight has already passed.",

ATC clearances do not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations for promoting the safety of flight operations or for any other purpose; neither do clearances relieve a pilot-in-command of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations. 4.5.1.4 - ATC units shall issue such ATC clearances as are necessary to prevent collisions and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. 4.5.1.5 - ATC clearances must be issued early enough to ensure that they are transmitted to the aircraft in sufficient time for it to comply with them.",

Furthermore, ICAO doc. 9643 contains the table in the above annex for the specific approaches that can be carried out during dependent parallel approaches. Mode 1 means independent, mode 2 means dependent. Before the invention of APV approaches (approaches with vertical guidance) and GLS (GBAS Landing Systems), ILS and MLS were the only available 3D approaches, known as precision approaches. The vast majority of parallel approaches still occur using ILS/MLS (but MLS is very rare). Dependent parallel approaches occur with radar separation, whereas independent parallel approaches do not need to be radar spaced, only monitored to make sure no aircraft enters the no-transgression zone (NTZ). Even though an aircraft could partake in dependent parallel approaches without ILS/MLS capabilities, this answer is still far more correct than the other available answers, which are not capable of performing such approaches (RNP APCH could technically manage for some approaches, but would need a specific individual assessment).",

This includes responsibility for obstacle clearance, except when an IFR flight is being vectored by radar. ICAO Doc 4444 8.6.5 Vectoring 8.6.5.2 When vectoring an IFR flight and when giving an IFR flight a direct routing which takes the aircraft off an ATS route, the controller shall issue clearances such that the prescribed obstacle clearance will exist at all times until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. When necessary, the relevant minimum vectoring altitude shall include a correction for low temperature effect. In this situation, both the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) play a joint role in ensuring terrain clearance. The PIC bears the responsibility of operating the aircraft safely and maintaining sufficient separation from terrain. Simultaneously, ATC is accountable for providing necessary guidance and issuing instructions to facilitate proper terrain clearance, as they guide the aircraft through radar vectoring. This collaborative effort between the PIC and ATC is crucial in guaranteeing the safety of the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight, especially in mountainous regions.",

Furthermore, ICAO doc. 9643 contains the table in the above annex for the specific approaches that can be carried out during dependent parallel approaches. Mode 1 means independent, mode 2 means dependent. Before the invention of APV approaches (approaches with vertical guidance) and GLS (GBAS Landing Systems), ILS and MLS were the only available 3D approaches, known as precision approaches. The vast majority of parallel approaches still occur using ILS/MLS (but MLS is very rare). Dependent parallel approaches occur with radar separation, whereas independent parallel approaches do not need to be radar spaced, only monitored to make sure no aircraft enters the no-transgression zone (NTZ). Even though an aircraft could partake in dependent parallel approaches without ILS/MLS capabilities, this answer is still far more correct than the other available answers, which are not capable of performing such approaches (RNP APCH could technically manage for some approaches, but would need a specific individual assessment).",

In this case, the two aircraft have very similar callsigns, only separated by \"Tango\" vs \"Bravo\", which are both similar sounding words. In this case, much confusion could be had when conversing with those aircraft, and it is therefore best to ask one to change their call sign. It is usually up to the controller to choose a different call sign, and in this case, they could change \"AT139\" to \"Helicopter 139\", for instance. The messages to change (and then later on revert) call sign from the controller would be: CHANGE YOUR CALL SIGN TO (new call sign) [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED] REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALL SIGN (call sign) [AT (significant point)]",

The controller has the power to give aircraft warning if they might be drifting towards the NTZ. If an aircraft does penetrate the NTZ, then the controller must order the other aircraft on the adjacent approach to make an immediate climb and turn onto a suitable heading. This procedure is in place as the controller would have already notified the transgressing aircraft, and they have still entered the NTZ, for some reason. The primary goal is the provide the other aircraft on the parallel approach with adequate separation, so that aircraft is ordered to climb and turn away as a priority.

For two aircraft using the same navigational aid: For VORs, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 15° and one aircraft must be at least 15 nm away from the VOR, to provide adequate separation. For NDBs, which are less accurate, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 30° and one aircraft must be at least 15 nm away from the NDB, to provide adequate separation.

Lateral separation between two aircraft exists when: a) VOR: both aircraft are established on radials diverging by at least 15 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; b) NDB: both aircraft are established on tracks to or from the NDB which are diverging by at least 30 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; (.) According to ICAO Doc 4444, different navaid specifies different lateral separation minima (i.e. VOR 15 degrees at 15 NM, NDB 30 degrees at 15 NM). Consequently, the lateral separation required for two aircraft converging on the same navaid radial depends on the navaid they use as a reference.",

It consists primarily of vortices generated by the wingtips of the aircraft. Wake turbulence is generated by particularly larger or heavier aircraft, as they pass through the air. This turbulence can create dangerous conditions for following aircraft, especially those flying at lower altitudes. By instructing a VFR flight to climb, ATC might be aiming to position the aircraft in a safer altitude band away from the wake turbulence generated by other aircraft. Let's examine the option 'To prevent an aircraft collision.' In a Class B airspace, separation is provided between VFR flights. However, in VFR flights the pilot is responsible to prevent collisions. Because the ATC instructs the aircraft to climb, we consider that the option 'To avoid wake turbulence.' is the most probable scenario.",

Source: ICAO Annex 11, Chapter 2, 2.11 Specifications for flight information regions, control areas and control zones ICAO Annex 11 - Chapter 2 2.11.4 Flight information regions or control areas in the upper airspace Recommendation.— Where it is desirable to limit the number of flight information regions or control areas through which high flying aircraft would otherwise have to operate, a flight information region or control area, as appropriate, should be delineated to include the upper airspace within the lateral limits of a number of lower flight information regions or control areas. Although the recommendation from Annex 11 above is worded in quite a complex way, it is not as complex as it looks. As high flying aircraft are moving fast and going long distances, and it is unnecessary for them to fly through many different FIRs or control areas, upper FIRs (UIRs) should be made, which encompass the upper airspace of multiple lower level FIRs. Therefore, upper FIRs are much larger than standard FIRs, so the faster aircraft at high levels are not constantly changing from one FIR to the next. See the annex above, France have multiple FIRs at lower levels, but only a single \"France UIR\" for high levels. In terms of answering this question, the correct answer is stated almost exactly in the recommendation above, the purpose of having larger upper FIRs are \"To limit the amount of FIRs a high-flying aircraft must operate in\".",

Source: ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 4, 4.5 Air traffic control clearances, 4.5.1 Scope and purpose ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS-ATM) 4.5 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCES 4.5.1 Scope and Purpose 4.5.1.1 Clearances are issued solely for expediting and separating air traffic and are based on known traffic conditions which affect safety in aircraft operation. Such traffic conditions include not only aircraft in the air and on the manoeuvring area over which control is being exercised, but also any vehicular traffic or other obstructions not permanently installed on the manoeuvring area in use. 4.5.1.2 If an air traffic control clearance is not suitable to the pilot-in-command of an aircraft, the flight crew may request and, if practicable, obtain an amended clearance. 4.5.1.3 The issuance of air traffic control clearances by air traffic control units constitutes authority for an aircraft to proceed only in so far as known air traffic is concerned. ATC clearances do not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations for promoting the safety of flight operations or for any other purpose; neither do clearances relieve a pilot-in-command of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations. 4.5.1.4 ATC units shall issue such ATC clearances as are necessary to prevent collisions and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. 4.5.1.5 ATC clearances must be issued early enough to ensure that they are transmitted to the aircraft in sufficient time for it to comply with them. Note: You could consider the answer about separation to also be correct, as clearances are issued for the separation of traffic, so that will always be their base function, but that would be quite a reach. The question directly refers to the regulation in bold above (via the LO above), that the clearances must be issued early enough to allow the pilots to comply with it, so we see that as the most correct answer by far.",

ALERTING SERVICE 5.1.1 Alerting service shall be provided: a) for all aircraft provided with air traffic control service; b) in so far as practicable, to all other aircraft having filed a flight plan or otherwise known to the air traffic services; and c) to any aircraft known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference. 5.1.2 Flight information centres or area control centres shall serve as the central point for collecting all information relevant to a state of emergency of an aircraft operating within the flight information region or control area concerned and for forwarding such information to the appropriate rescue coordination centre. 5.1.3 In the event of a state of emergency arising to an aircraft while it is under the control of an aerodrome control tower or approach control unit, such unit shall notify immediately the flight information centre or area control centre responsible which shall in turn notify the rescue coordination centre, except that notification of the area control centre, flight information centre, or rescue coordination centre shall not be required when the nature of the emergency is such that the notification would be superfluous. 5.1.3.1 Nevertheless, whenever the urgency of the situation so requires, the aerodrome control tower or approach control unit responsible shall first alert and take other necessary steps to set in motion all appropriate local rescue and emergency organizations which can give the immediate assistance required. This says that Air Traffic Service Units are the ones which initiate the appropriate emergency phase relevant to that aircraft. If the aircraft is being handled by a particular ATS unit, they will be the ones to initiate the emergency phase.",

The ATC unit should then coordinate with the flight crew the following: a) the route to be flown, which, if possible, should be clear of cities and towns, preferably over water and away from areas where thunderstorms have been reported or are expected; b) the level to be used, which should be not less than 1800 m (6000 ft); and c) the duration of the fuel dumping. During flight planning the pilot takes into account the maximum take off and landing mass of the aircraft to determine the maximum cargo and fuel load applicable. In case of an emergency, the fuel burnt might not be enough to allow the aircraft to land with a mass less than the maximum landing mass, and fuel dumping may be the solution to reduce the mass. Fuel dumping must take place above 6000 ft.",

Upon concluding radar service, the pilot is advised to resume their own navigation, reinstating their responsibility for guiding the aircraft. Subsequently, if the aircraft had been deviated from its original course due to vectoring, the controller furnishes the aircraft's position along with suitable instructions. This positional information is conveyed using various methods: • A recognised geographic position • Track and distance (magnetic) to some significant point or navigation aid • Direction and distance from a well-known position • Touchdown distance (for aircraft on finals) • Proximity to an ATS route centreline Position of aircraft ⇒ heading 150, distance to the point 60 NM Specific instructions ⇒ direct to (name of the point) Note: Providing only the distance from some point is not enough to indicate the position of the aircraft.",

We have therefore created our own correct answer, so this is unlikely to be what you see in the exam! Therefore, please send any further exam feedback you have about this one to us in the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. As this is a new question to us, we would prefer to give you an idea of what they may ask, rather than wait for further feedback. ICAO Annex 11 - Chapter 4 4.3.4 Voice-automatic terminal information service (Voice-ATIS) broadcasts 4.3.4.1 Voice-automatic terminal information service (Voice-ATIS) broadcasts shall be provided at aerodromes where there is a requirement to reduce the communication load on the ATS VHF air-ground communication channels. When provided, they shall comprise: a) one broadcast serving arriving aircraft; or b) one broadcast serving departing aircraft; or c) one broadcast serving both arriving and departing aircraft; or d) two broadcasts serving arriving and departing aircraft respectively at those aerodromes where the length of a broadcast serving both arriving and departing aircraft would be excessively long. 4.3.4.2 A discrete VHF frequency shall, whenever practicable, be used for Voice-ATIS broadcasts. If a discrete frequency is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel(s) of the most appropriate terminal navigation aid(s), preferably a VOR, provided the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the navigation aid is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated. 4.3.4.3 Voice-ATIS broadcasts shall not be transmitted on the voice channel of an ILS. 4.3.4.4 Whenever Voice-ATIS is provided, the broadcast shall be continuous and repetitive. 4.3.4.5 The information contained in the current broadcast shall immediately be made known to the ATS unit(s) concerned with the provision to aircraft of information relating to approach, landing and takeoff, whenever the message has not been prepared by that (those) unit(s). 4.3.4.6 Voice-ATIS broadcasts provided at designated aerodromes for use by international air services shall be available in the English language as a minimum. 4.3.4.7 Recommendation.— Where Voice-ATIS broadcasts are available in more than one language, a discrete channel should be used for each language. 4.3.4.8 Recommendation.— The Voice-ATIS broadcast message should, whenever practicable, not exceed 30 seconds, care being taken that the readability of the ATIS message is not impaired by the speed of the transmission or by the identification signal of a navigation aid used for transmission of ATIS. The ATIS broadcast message should take into consideration human performance. To go through the options: \"in English only, for departure and arrival traffic, lasting one minute.\" Incorrect. 4.3.4.6 above dictates the rules for languages, and it is not \"English only\". They should also not exceed 30 seconds where practical, as per recommendation 4.3.4.8. \"for arrival traffic only, on the ILS localiser frequency.\" Incorrect. They can be broadcast to arrival and departure aircraft, and NEVER using the ILS frequency. \"for arrival traffic only, preferably on the VOR frequency.\" Incorrect. They can be broadcast to arrival and departure aircraft, on a discreet VHF requency if available, but if they have to be used on a radio aid frequency, then it should preferably be a VOR. There is a little more truth in this one than the above options, but we still consider it to be incorrect. \"for arrival and departure traffic, preferably on a discreet VHF frequency.\" Correct, but we made it up due to a gap in feedback, so it is not what you will see in the exam.",

A generic term meaning variously, flight information service, alerting service, air traffic advisory service, air traffic control service (area control service, approach control service or aerodrome control service). The band normally used for voice communication is defined between 118.000 and 136.975 MHz, which covers its use for commercial and general aviation, air traffic control and other uses. This band is a sub-part of the VHF frequency band. The VHF propagation is practically straight-line propagation (similar to light waves). Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band.

An aircraft which has deviated significantly from its intended track or which reports that it is lost. Unidentified aircraft. An aircraft which has been observed or reported to be operating in a given area but whose identity has not been established.

Also, noise abatement may be a factor for the choice of runway, however this must always come secondarily to safety factors. Thankfully, this scenario is quite easy, as the pilot's aircraft does not have the required take-off performance to depart on Runway 22, so they must request a departure from Runway 04 instead (assuming there is only a single runway). ATC may not be able to accommodate this request, but they should attempt to do so. The options are therefore no departure or a departure from Runway 04, as the pilot cannot depart from Runway 22. This would be a cleared departure from Runway 04, the option including the incident report is ridiculous.",

Any further exam feedback, as always, is very useful! When aircraft are navigating via the same navigational aid and also require lateral separation from each other, they are required to fly certain tracks (often diverging by no less than a particular angle) as well as a distance away from a common nav-aid (to make sure they are not too close together. For VORs, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 15° and one aircraft must be at least 15 NM away from the VOR, to provide adequate separation. For NDBs, which are less accurate, they must fly diverging tracks of no less than 30° and one aircraft must be at least 15 NM away from the NDB, to provide adequate separation. This does mean that there is no set separation for all nav-aids (and when GNSS is used it is different again), so we must answer that it is \"according to the navigational aid in use\". Again, this may not be the exact wording in the exam.",

Source: ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 8, 8.6.2.3 SSR and/or MLAT identification procedures and Chapter 8, 8.6.2.4 PSR identification procedures ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS ATM) - (Notes removed) 8.6.2.3 SSR and/or MLAT IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES 8.6.2.3.1 Where SSR and/or MLAT is used for identification, aircraft may be identified by one or more of the following procedures: a) recognition of the aircraft identification in an SSR and/or MLAT label; b) recognition of an assigned discrete code, the setting of which has been verified, in an SSR and/or MLAT label; and c) direct recognition of the aircraft identification of a Mode S-equipped aircraft in an SSR and/or MLAT label; d) by transfer of identification (see 8.6.3); e) observation of compliance with an instruction to set a specific code; f) observation of compliance with an instruction to squawk IDENT. 8.6.2.3.2 When a discrete code has been assigned to an aircraft, a check shall be made at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the code set by the pilot is identical to that assigned for the flight. Only after this check has been made shall the discrete code be used as a basis for identification. 8.6.2.4 PSR IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES 8.6.2.4.1 Where PSR is used for identification, aircraft may be identified by one or more of the following procedures: a) by correlating a particular radar position indication with an aircraft reporting its position over, or as bearing and distance from, a point shown on the situation display, and by ascertaining that the track of the particular radar position is consistent with the aircraft path or reported heading; b) by correlating an observed radar position indication with an aircraft which is known to have just departed, provided that the identification is established within 2 km (1 NM) from the end of the runway used. Particular care should be taken to avoid confusion with aircraft holding over or overflying the aerodrome, or with aircraft departing from or making a missed approach over adjacent runways; c) by transfer of identification (see 8.6.3); d) by ascertaining the aircraft heading, if circumstances require, and following a period of track observation: — instructing the pilot to execute one or more changes of heading of 30 degrees or more and correlating the movements of one particular radar position indication with the aircraft’s acknowledged execution of the instructions given; or — correlating the movements of a particular radar position indication with manoeuvres currently executed by an aircraft having so reported. When using these methods, the controller shall: i) verify that the movements of not more than one radar position indication correspond with those of the aircraft; and ii) ensure that the manoeuvre(s) will not carry the aircraft outside the coverage of the radar or the situation display. 8.6.2.4.2 Use may be made of direction-finding bearings to assist in identification of an aircraft. This method, however, shall not be used as the sole means of establishing identification, unless so prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority for particular cases under specified conditions. From the above document, we can see that both Primary (PSR) and Secondary (SSR) surveillance radar can be used to identify an aircraft on the radar screen. For SSR, squawking a specific code/ident are both good ways of identifying an aircraft, but using PSR only, the controller may have to ask the pilot to do a series of specific turns and track their position to positively identify the aircraft. In both these cases, an aircraft would not be asked to set an emergency squawk code (unless actually in an emergency situation of course), and whilst climbing and descending could provide a little identification in SSR, it is not an approved method.",

The other scenario that needs to be covered is LIGHT following MEDIUM, which is easy to remember, as it is just 1NM knocked off the LIGHT following HEAVY separation above, so 6 NM - 1 NM = 5 NM. Given the easy layout of the table, it is usually either best to memorise some of these numbers and the pattern they fall in, or just memorise the whole table. \"SUPER\" heavy aircraft are not covered in this table.",

Source: ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 4, 4.10.4 Provision of altimeter setting information ICAO Doc 4444 4.10.4 Provision of altimeter setting information 4.10.4.3 The flight crew shall be provided with the transition level in due time prior to reaching it during descent. This may be accomplished by voice communications, ATIS broadcast or data link. 4.10.4.4 The transition level shall be included in approach clearances when so prescribed by the appropriate authority or requested by the pilot. 4.10.4.5 A QNH altimeter setting shall be included in the descent clearance when first cleared to an altitude below the transition level, in approach clearances or clearances to enter the traffic circuit, and in taxi clearances for departing aircraft, except when it is known that the aircraft has already received the information. The transition level is the top of the transition layer, where aircraft go from flying using altitudes to using flight levels. The transition level is only really important during descent as the crew of an aircraft must go from using 1013 hPa to using QNH or RPS at the transition level in the descent. This question is quite badly made, but is easy enough to answer, as there is only one possible answer (although it is still not a good answer in our opinion). \"In approach and landing clearances.\" Correct (mostly). As per the information above, the approach clearance may include the transition level if requested by the pilot or so prescribed by the authority (some approaches will begin above the transition levels to some airports). We are not sure of the use of \"landing clearance\" here, as there is no mention of it in the landing clearance, and the vast majority of aircraft are cleared to land much after they descend through the transition level, but it is the only possible answer. \"When changing FL en-route.\" There is no mention of descent here, so one must assume that it is talking about a change of cruising altitude. This would usually be a climb, so the transition level would not be given. \"In their take-off clearance.\" The transition level is only required for descent through the transition layer, so would not be given at take-off. \"At the flight planning stage.\" The transition level is calculated by ATC depending on the conditions of the day. It is therefore changeable and not necessarily available at the flight planning stage (though it can often be calculated by the pilot if they really wish, but that is not \"receiving the transition level\").",

The appropriate ATS unit is usually the one you are currently in contact with, in this case, Paris ATC. These are the controllers who know most of the details about your flight, your current routing, position, etc. The pilot(s) may elect to speak to 121.5 MHz emergency frequency instead, as these controllers are more set up to handle emergencies, and have the benefit of extra training, and more available resources such as VDF auto-triangulation. The change to 121.5 MHz can be done without notifying the previous controller, as the emergency controllers will soon notify your previous ATC as to the situation. In reality, you would most likely want to stay on your current frequency to save time, as long as the controllers will be able to adequately deal with your emergency, and you can always change to 121.5 MHz if required later on.",

Outside of these conditions, it can be requested for an aircraft to follow published noise abatement procedures, and in this case, that is very likely, due to the time of the day, and the favourable conditions on everything other than wind. Of course, if the aircraft cannot take-off from that runway with a 4kt tailwind for performance reasons, for instance, then it is a different story, but that is not part of the question. Of course, the most sensitive segment of flight for noise abatement is the initial departure phase, when the aircraft is loudest, not whilst taxiing and on the aprons.",

In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation). It is important to note that the OCA/H is not always the same as Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H), but a DA/H will never be lower than the corresponding OCA/H.",

ATC tolerance - This is not a real thing. Ground equipment tolerance - The margin for error in a VOR transmitter, for example. This does affect the tolerance of a fix. Flight technical tolerance - This is the tolerance with which the aircraft is being flown, and is an odd choice for this question, but does also include display errors and innacuracies reading the instruments, which affect fix accuracy and tolerance area.

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the TCAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. Pilots must NOT request an altitude clearance from ATC before performing the Resolution Advisory Manoeuvre. The manoeuvre should be followed immediately, as TCAS RAs override ATC authority until clear of conflict.",

The pilot has the runway lights of aerodrome C in sight. A missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. Since the pilot has the runway lights of airport C in sight, he may execute the approach procedure until 1000 ft above aerodrome elevation or the final approach segment if the DH or MDH is higher than 1000 ft, and then request a visual approach. The reason the pilot would normally choose airport C is because of the fuel emergency that leads to a distress condition, since airport C is the nearest suitable airport and the aircraft should land as soon as possible.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question was created based on incomplete feedback. If you encounter it in your official exam, please inform us. The information provided by ACAS II is intended to assist flight crew in the safe operation of an aeroplane by providing advice on appropriate action to reduce the risk of collision. This is achieved through Resolution Advisories (RAs), which propose manoeuvres, and through Traffic Advisories (TAs), which are intended to prompt visual acquisition and to act as a warning that an RA may follow. Traffic Advisory (TA) means a caution to the flight crew that an aircraft has become a potential collision threat. Resolution Advisory (RA) means a warning to the flight crew of an imminent collision threat, combined with commands for the crew to use in avoiding an airborne collision. When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane. In nearly all cases, it's crucial to adhere to ACAS' guidance. There are only a few exceptions when you should not immediately respond to an RA: If you receive a stall warning, further maneuvering could lead to a stall. If there is a windshear warning, use all available aircraft performance to escape the windshear threat. If there is a ground proximity warning, use all available aircraft performance to avoid terrain closure. Note: In this instance, we find that the option \"terrain alert\" is not as applicable since the TCAS RA specifically directs the aircraft to \"CLIMB\".",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Full obstacle clearances are applied over the primary areas reducing to zero at the outer edges of the secondary areas ( 1.3.2 On straight segments, the width of the primary area at any given point is equal to one-half of the total width. The width of each secondary area is equal to one-quarter of the total width. 1.3.3 Where no track guidance is provided during a turn specified by the procedure, the total width of the area is considered primary area. 1.3.4 The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) is provided for the whole width of the primary area. In the secondary area, MOC is provided at the inner edges reducing to zero at the outer edges ( We are interested in how the primary and secondary areas are established in this question. Be careful that primary area is not divided into two, it has a half of the total width in the center. Video Explanation:",

In flight, when an aircraft is at or below the transition altitude, its vertical position is expressed in terms of altitude, which is determined from an altimeter set to sea level pressure (QNH). b) In flight above the transition altitude, the vertical position of an aircraft is expressed in terms of flight levels, which are surfaces of constant atmospheric pressure based on an altimeter setting of 1013.2 hPa. c) The change in reference from altitude to flight levels, and vice versa, is made: 1) at the transition altitude, when climbing; and 2) at the transition level, when descending.",
