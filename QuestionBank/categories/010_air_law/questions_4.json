In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation). It is important to note that the OCA/H is not always the same as Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H), but a DA/H will never be lower than the corresponding OCA/H.",

Therefore, there can be no single procedure designed that will cater for conducting a circling approach in every situation. 7.2.2 After initial visual contact, the basic assumption is that the runway environment should be kept in sight while at minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) for circling.

            "explanation": "Note: The wording here might be slightly different than in the exam, the feedback was unclear about it. Please let us know if you see the question and how it was phrased, thank you! Short explanation: The Boeing 777 falls under the C/D category aircraft, with a reference height of 420 ft (plus an additional 50 ft for operational considerations). Precision approach: decision altitude or height (DA/DH): Category C/D aircraft: 420 ft (with 50 ft added for operational reasons). Therefore, the calculation simplifies to: DH = 420 ft + 50 ft = 470 ft Detailed explanation: So one part of this question is asking you to choose from MDH or DH. Decision Height (DH) refers to precision approaches, and is the lowest height above the runway threshold where the pilot must begin a missed approach, if the runway is not yet in sight. So operationally, it is where you decide to continue if visual, or begin the go-around procedure if you are not yet visual. Minimum Descent Height (MDH) refers to non-precision approaches (NPAs), and is a relic of the past, where NPAs could be flown by descending to the MDA/H and flying level until visual with the runway or the missed approach point. So therefore, as we are dealing with a precision approach here, the answer begins with DH. The next job is to work out what the DH of the approach will be for that B777. It is a very large aircraft and accompanies approach categories C/D (two categories because its circling speed puts it in a different category to the VAT speed). The approach category of an aircraft depends on its VAT speed (speed over the threshold) at MLM (maximum landing mass), or circling minima, which can give it two categories, as mentioned above. Having categories for this means that different approach speeds can be taken into account for obstacle clearance, circle to land and go-around manoeuvres. As the B777 category is C/D, we can use 420 ft, plus the 50 ft addition (it is very common to add a small amount like this, for different corrections and safety margin, decided by the operator). Therefore our answer is DH = 470 ft.",

When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Let's see each choice individually: The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating. This choice is correct. If the approach is executed with a higher speed, it may be difficult for the aircraft to decelerate after touchdown and come to stop within the available runway length. The aircraft may struggle to touch down precisely at the desired point, leading to an extended touchdown point and requiring additional runway to come to a stop. You may land before the threshold to get more braking distance. Braking distance becomes critical when approaching a short runway. Landing before the threshold is not allowed and not considered an option, so this choice is wrong. Nothing, you can make it This choice could be correct as well, but we choose the option \"The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating.\" Please provide further feedback if available. The aircraft will automatically adjust its landing speed to match the shorter runway length. The landing speed of an aircraft is determined by factors such as aircraft type, weight, approach configuration, and wind conditions. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the aircraft is operated within safe landing parameters, regardless of the length of the runway. Simply landing on a shorter runway does not trigger an automatic adjustment of the aircraft's landing speed.",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Note 2.— Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic causing an RA. Visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at night. When a RA occurs, the Flight Crew must notify the appropriate ATC unit as soon as possible, as permitted by Flight Crew workload, in the following manner: \"Company 123, TCAS RA standby\" If the pilot is unable to comply with an ATC clearance or instruction because there is a RA, the appropriate response is: \"Company 123 - Unable - TCAS RA Standby\" The ATC response in both cases should be: \"roger\" This relieves the controller of the responsibility to provide separation and he will not try to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" When TCAS announces \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" the PF must return the aeroplane promptly but smoothly to the ATC clearance. Announce the TCAS \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" message when the conflict is over using the phraseology: \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO (assigned clearance)\", or \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, (assigned clearance) RESUMED\".",

The choice of entry depends on the aircraft's magnetic track to the holding fix. The holding inbound course is 360°. This means that the outbound course is 360° - 180° = 180°. The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 90°, which places it into the parallel entry sector (sector 1 - blue color). How to divide the sectors: Measure an angle of 70 degrees from the inbound track towards the holding ( Expand the 70 degrees line on both sides of the holding. Expand the inbound track as well (the track of 360 degrees for this example). Three sectors should appear. The largest one is the direct entry sector (green), the smallest one is the offset entry sector (purple) and the remaining one is the parallel entry sector (blue). Note: The inbound track is the track towards the holding fix. Parallel entry procedure (left-hand pattern): Entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to the right to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound track). The aircraft should follow the track of 180° for the appropriate timing or DME distance. Turn inbound: When the time has passed or the limiting DME is reached, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 360° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the left to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed.",

These categories provide a standardized basis for relating aircraft manoeuvrability to specific instrument approach procedures. For precision approach procedures, the dimensions of the aircraft are also a factor for the calculation of the obstacle clearance height (OCH). For Category DL aircraft, an additional obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is provided, when necessary, to take into account the specific dimensions of these aircraft. 3.3.1.3 The criterion taken into consideration for the classification of aeroplanes by categories is the indicated airspeed at threshold (Vat), which is equal to the stall speed Vso multiplied by 1.3, or stall speed Vs1g multiplied by 1.23 in the landing configuration at the maximum certificated landing mass.

The transition from the visual (circling) manoeuvre to the missed approach should be initiated by a climbing turn, within the circling area, towards the landing runway, to return to the circling altitude or higher, immediately followed by interception and execution of the missed approach procedure. The indicated airspeed during these manoeuvres shall not exceed the maximum indicated airspeed associated with visual manoeuvring. 6.4.2 The circling manoeuvre may be carried out in more than one direction. For this reason, different patterns are required to establish the aircraft on the prescribed missed approach course depending on its position at the time visual reference is lost.

            "explanation": "SEGMENTS OF INSTRUMENT APPROACH 1. An Arrival Segment is the phase during which the aircraft transits from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles. Given that explanation, we can look at each option individually. \"is within the en-route structure and starting the arrival.\" Incorrect. The aircraft left the en-route structure at the beginning of the arrival, and the IAF is at the end of the arrival, so the arrival is finished by this point also. \"has left the en-route structure.\" Correct. The aircraft left the en-route section at the beginning of the arrival, and is now finished with the arrival (at the IAF). \"has started the final approach.\" Incorrect, the aircraft will not begin the final approach until the FAF (Final Approach Fix). \"is flying at the approach altitude.\" Incorrect. The IAF is often at a different altitude to the final \"platform altitude\" as it is often known (this is what we assume is meant by the approach altitude).",

ICAO Doc 8168 1.8 VERTICAL PATH CONTROL ON NON-PRECISION APPROACH PROCEDURES 1.8.1 Introduction 1.8.1.1 Studies have shown that the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is high on non-precision approaches. While the procedures themselves are not inherently unsafe, the use of the traditional step down descent technique for flying non-precision approaches is prone to error, and is therefore discouraged. Operators should reduce this risk by emphasizing training and standardization in vertical path control on non-precision approach procedures. Operators typically employ one of three techniques for vertical path control on non-precision approaches: a) continuous descent final approach (CDFA); b) constant angle descent; and c) step down approach. Of these techniques, the CDFA technique is preferred. Operators should use the CDFA technique whenever possible as it adds to the safety of the approach operation by reducing pilot workload and by lessening the possibility of error in flying the approach.",

(b) If the minimum RVR for an approach is more than the maximum value assessed by the aerodrome operator, then CMV should be used. (c) In order to determine CMV from visibility: (1) for flight planning purposes, a factor of 1.0 should be used; (2) for purposes other than flight planning, the conversion factors specified in Table 16 should be used.",

Where a steeper descent gradient is necessary, the maximum permissible is 6.5 per cent/3.7° (65 m/km (395 ft/NM)) for Category A and B aircraft, 6.1 per cent/3.5° (61 m/km (370 ft/NM)) for Category C, D and E aircraft, and 10 per cent (5.7°) for Category H. For procedures with VOR or NDB on aerodrome and no FAF, rates of descent in the final approach phase are given in Table I-4-1-3. In the case of a precision approach, the operationally preferred glide path angle is 3.0° as specified in Annex 10, Volume I. An ILS glide path/MLS elevation angle in excess of 3.0° is used only where alternate means available to satisfy obstacle clearance requirements are impractical.

The basic holding area is the airspace required for a holding pattern at a specific level, based on the allowances for aircraft speed, wind effect, timing errors, holding fix characteristics, etc. The entry area is the airspace required for the entry procedure. 2.4.2 Buffer area 2.4.2.1 An additional buffer area extends 9.3 km (5.0 NM) beyond the boundary of the holding area. Significant obstacles in the buffer area are taken into consideration when determining the minimum holding level. 2.4.2.2 For helicopter holding procedures, the buffer area is 3.7 km (2 NM) wide and only applies below 1830 m (6000 ft).",

            "explanation": "In a standard holding pattern, turns are made to the right. There are three types of entry to the holding pattern: direct, parallel, and offset (also known as teardrop) entries. The choice of entry depends on the aircraft's magnetic track to the holding fix. The holding inbound course is 341°. This means that the outbound course is 341° - 180° = 161°. The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 150°, which places it into the offset entry sector (sector 2). Offset entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to follow a magnetic track of 131° which creates an angle of 30° with the inbound course (161° - 30° = 131°). The aircraft is flying at 3 000 ft and should follow the track of 131° for one minute because it is flying below 14 000 ft (For 1 min at or below 14 000 ft, for 1 min 30 sec above 14 000 ft). Turn inbound: When one minute has passed, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 341° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 161° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed. ICAO Doc 8168 - Flight Procedures 1.4 ENTRY Sector 1 procedure (parallel entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned left onto an outbound heading for the appropriate period of time; then b) the aircraft is turned left onto the holding side to intercept the inbound track or to return to the fix; and then c) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 2 procedure (offset entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned onto a heading to make good a track making an angle of 30° from the reciprocal of the inbound track on the holding side; then b) the aircraft will fly outbound: 1) for the appropriate period of time, where timing is specified; or 2) until the appropriate limiting DME distance is reached, where distance is specified. If a limiting radial is also specified, then the outbound distance is determined either by the limiting DME distance or the limiting radial, whichever comes first; c) the aircraft is turned right to intercept the inbound holding track; and d) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 3 procedure (direct entry): Having reached the fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Altimeter setting Procedures. Transition Altitude. The altitude in the vicinity of an airport at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is determined from an altimeter set to QNH. Transition altitude is normally specified for each airfield by the country in which the airfield exists. Transition altitude will not normally be below 3000 ft and must be published on the appropriate charts. Transition Level. The lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude. Transition level is usually passed to the aircraft during the approach or landing clearances. The transition layer may be published, or it may be supplied by ATC via the ATIS or during the arrival. Half flight levels may be used: for example, \"FL45\". Transition between Flight Levels and Altitudes. The vertical position of an aircraft at or below transition altitude shall be expressed in altitude (QNH). Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending. After an approach clearance has been issued and the descent to land is commenced, the vertical positioning of an aircraft above the transition level may be by reference to altitude (QNH) provided that level flight above the transition altitude is not indicated or anticipated. This is intended for turbo jet aircraft where an uninterrupted descent from high altitude is desired and for airfields equipped to reference altitudes throughout the descent. Normally, switching over to QNH will occur at the Transition Level. However, exceptions shall be allowed where the vertical position of the aircraft may be referenced to altitudes, provided that the aircraft is descending, does not level off above the transition altitude and has received an approach clearance.",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. RA is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of this system despite possible conflicting ATC instructions. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, nonetheless pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology.",

The runway environment includes features such as the runway threshold or approach lighting aids or other markings identifiable with the runway.

Kindly see regulation below. \"If the flight is below the transition altitude.\" - WRONG. Below the transition altitude, the vertical position of the aircraft will be expressed as altitude. \"At or below the lowest usable flight level.\" - WRONG. See regulation below. Rules of the air, annex 2 CHAPTER 3. GENERAL RULES 3.1.3 Cruising levels The cruising levels at which a flight or a portion of a flight is to be conducted shall be in terms of: a) flight levels, for flights at or above the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, above the transition altitude; b) altitudes, for flights below the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, at or below the transition altitude. Note.— The system of flight levels is prescribed in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services — Aircraft Operations (Doc 8168). ICAO Doc 4444 1- For flights in the vicinity of aerodromes and within terminal control areas the vertical position of aircraft shall, except as provided for in 4.10.1.2, be expressed in terms of altitudes at or below the transition altitude and in terms of flight levels at or above the transition level. While passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when climbing and in terms of altitudes when descending.",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the ACAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during an ACAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. When there is a collision danger between two aircraft, the ACAS systems of these aircraft will inform the pilots in the form of Resolution Advisory (RA) giving them instructions to follow. The ACAS systems of the two aircraft are communicating with each other in order to provide the pilots with non-contradicting instructions (i.e. one aircraft may instructed to climb and the other to descend). The ATC is usually unaware of the onset of a Resolution Advisory (RA) and the respective instructions given to the pilots. That is the reason why after following the Resolution Advisory (RA), the pilot shall notify the ATC as soon as possible. Note: After the response to an ACAS RA is completed, a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated. (ICAO Doc 4444)",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

GENERAL RULES 3.1.3 Cruising levels The cruising levels at which a flight or a portion of a flight is to be conducted shall be in terms of: a) flight levels, for flights at or above the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, above the transition altitude; b) altitudes, for flights below the lowest usable flight level or, where applicable, at or below the transition altitude. Note.— The system of flight levels is prescribed in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services — Aircraft Operations (Doc 8168). ICAO Doc 4444 1- For flights in the vicinity of aerodromes and within terminal control areas the vertical position of aircraft shall, except as provided for in 4.10.1.2, be expressed in terms of altitudes at or below the transition altitude and in terms of flight levels at or above the transition level. While passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when climbing and in terms of altitudes when descending. Note: We are aware that some databases may have a different correct option, which is as follows: “altitudes, for flights below the lowest usable flight level”. We do not have that option, instead we have one which states: “AT OR Below” => making it incorrect. Note: We suggest appealing this question if you come across it because one could argue that there are 2 possible correct answers.

Different modes of operation are applicable for parallel runways, and they are defined by a mode number that specifies the type of operation being carried out. Mode 1: Independent Parallel Approaches Independent parallel approaches involve simultaneous adjacent approaches to parallel instrument runways. ATS surveillance system separation minima between aircraft using adjacent published instrument approach procedures are not applied on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 1 is labeled as independent and indicates that the operations on one runway are completely unrelated to those on the other. Mode 2: Dependent Parallel Approaches Dependent parallel approaches involve adjacent aircraft making simultaneous instrument approaches to parallel runways, with radar separation applied longitudinally and laterally between the aircraft on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 2 (dependent) functions similarly, but with the inclusion of radar separation, resulting in operations on one runway being reliant on those on the other. Mode 3: Independent Parallel Departures Aircraft depart from the parallel runways at the same time.

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Aircraft flying in the same region are using the same QNH (given by ATC) as an altimeter setting when flying below the transition altitude. This allows the pilots to report their altitude based on the same reference pressure point, and also allows the ATC to provide separation between them. When flying above the transition altitude, all aircraft are using the standard pressure setting of 1013.2 hPa. Below the transition altitude, vertical separation is provided by assigning different altitudes to the aircraft. Above the transition altitude, vertical separation is provided by assigning different flight levels to the aircraft.",

NAT Doc. 007 16.5.5 - For flights which intend to operate through the New York Oceanic East or West, or Santa Maria Oceanic FIRs, RNAV 10 (RNP 10) or RNP- 4 approval is required in order to benefit from the reduced lateral separations employed here. Any NAT HLA aircraft intending to fly within these airspaces should ensure that its RNP approval status is also included in the flight plan. Specifically such operators should annotate ICAO flight plan Item 10 (Equipment) with the letter “R” and annotate Item 18 (Other Information) with, as appropriate, “PBN/A1 (for RNAV 10 (RNP 10) approval) or PBN/L1 (for RNP 4 approval)” (see Chapter 4).

Conditions applicable to the use of this procedure are contained in Section 5.9. Looking at the options above and the annex, it is clear that VFR flights are not legally required to be separated from other VFR flights in any airspace. Therefore, at all times, the pilot in command of a VFR flight is responsible for their own traffic separation. Whilst you could argue that some scenarios would make ATC also responsible for traffic separation, that is only with aircraft under certain flight rules, not all aircraft, and certainly not in all VFR approach scenarios.

ATC clearances do not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations for promoting the safety of flight operations or for any other purpose; neither do clearances relieve a pilot-in-command of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations. 4.5.1.4 - ATC units shall issue such ATC clearances as are necessary to prevent collisions and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. 4.5.1.5 - ATC clearances must be issued early enough to ensure that they are transmitted to the aircraft in sufficient time for it to comply with them.",

Furthermore, ICAO doc. 9643 contains the table in the above annex for the specific approaches that can be carried out during dependent parallel approaches. Mode 1 means independent, mode 2 means dependent. Before the invention of APV approaches (approaches with vertical guidance) and GLS (GBAS Landing Systems), ILS and MLS were the only available 3D approaches, known as precision approaches. The vast majority of parallel approaches still occur using ILS/MLS (but MLS is very rare). Dependent parallel approaches occur with radar separation, whereas independent parallel approaches do not need to be radar spaced, only monitored to make sure no aircraft enters the no-transgression zone (NTZ). Even though an aircraft could partake in dependent parallel approaches without ILS/MLS capabilities, this answer is still far more correct than the other available answers, which are not capable of performing such approaches (RNP APCH could technically manage for some approaches, but would need a specific individual assessment).",

In this situation, both the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) play a joint role in ensuring terrain clearance. The PIC bears the responsibility of operating the aircraft safely and maintaining sufficient separation from terrain. Simultaneously, ATC is accountable for providing necessary guidance and issuing instructions to facilitate proper terrain clearance, as they guide the aircraft through radar vectoring. This collaborative effort between the PIC and ATC is crucial in guaranteeing the safety of the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight, especially in mountainous regions.",

Particular care should be taken to avoid confusion with aircraft holding over or overflying the aerodrome, or with aircraft departing from or making a missed approach over adjacent runways; c) by transfer of identification; d) by ascertaining the aircraft heading, if circumstances require, and following a period of track observation; Note: The question does not specify if identification is accomplished by the use of SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar) or PSR (Primary Surveillance Radar) or both, but the answer containing correct identification methods using radar is “Assign a transponder code, or squawk IDENT, or match a radar position indication with an aircraft's reported position.”",

Furthermore, ICAO doc. 9643 contains the table in the above annex for the specific approaches that can be carried out during dependent parallel approaches. Mode 1 means independent, mode 2 means dependent. Before the invention of APV approaches (approaches with vertical guidance) and GLS (GBAS Landing Systems), ILS and MLS were the only available 3D approaches, known as precision approaches. The vast majority of parallel approaches still occur using ILS/MLS (but MLS is very rare). Dependent parallel approaches occur with radar separation, whereas independent parallel approaches do not need to be radar spaced, only monitored to make sure no aircraft enters the no-transgression zone (NTZ). Even though an aircraft could partake in dependent parallel approaches without ILS/MLS capabilities, this answer is still far more correct than the other available answers, which are not capable of performing such approaches (RNP APCH could technically manage for some approaches, but would need a specific individual assessment).",

In this case, the two aircraft have very similar callsigns, only separated by \"Tango\" vs \"Bravo\", which are both similar sounding words. In this case, much confusion could be had when conversing with those aircraft, and it is therefore best to ask one to change their call sign. It is usually up to the controller to choose a different call sign, and in this case, they could change \"AT139\" to \"Helicopter 139\", for instance. The messages to change (and then later on revert) call sign from the controller would be: CHANGE YOUR CALL SIGN TO (new call sign) [UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED] REVERT TO FLIGHT PLAN CALL SIGN (call sign) [AT (significant point)]",

Note: This is a meteorology question which is out of the scope of RNAV. However, a student has recently come across it during his/her RNAV exam. If it comes up under this subject, you should appeal it.",

The controller has the power to give aircraft warning if they might be drifting towards the NTZ. If an aircraft does penetrate the NTZ, then the controller must order the other aircraft on the adjacent approach to make an immediate climb and turn onto a suitable heading. This procedure is in place as the controller would have already notified the transgressing aircraft, and they have still entered the NTZ, for some reason. The primary goal is the provide the other aircraft on the parallel approach with adequate separation, so that aircraft is ordered to climb and turn away as a priority.

By position reports which positively indicate the aircraft are over different geographic locations as determined visually or by reference to a navigation aid ( 5.4.1.2.1.2 By use of NDB, VOR or GNSS on intersecting tracks or ATS routes. By requiring aircraft to fly on specified tracks which are separated by a minimum amount appropriate to the navigation aid employed. Lateral separation between two aircraft exists when: a) VOR: both aircraft are established on radials diverging by at least 15 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; b) NDB: both aircraft are established on tracks to or from the NDB which are diverging by at least 30 degrees and at least one aircraft is at a distance of 28 km (15 NM) or more from the facility ; (.) According to ICAO Doc 4444, different navaid specifies different lateral separation minima (i.e. VOR 15 degrees at 15 NM, NDB 30 degrees at 15 NM).

It consists primarily of vortices generated by the wingtips of the aircraft. Wake turbulence is generated by particularly larger or heavier aircraft, as they pass through the air. This turbulence can create dangerous conditions for following aircraft, especially those flying at lower altitudes. By instructing a VFR flight to climb, ATC might be aiming to position the aircraft in a safer altitude band away from the wake turbulence generated by other aircraft. Let's examine the option 'To prevent an aircraft collision.' In a Class B airspace, separation is provided between VFR flights. However, in VFR flights the pilot is responsible to prevent collisions. Because the ATC instructs the aircraft to climb, we consider that the option 'To avoid wake turbulence.' is the most probable scenario.",

Source: ICAO Annex 11, Chapter 2, 2.11 Specifications for flight information regions, control areas and control zones ICAO Annex 11 - Chapter 2 2.11.4 Flight information regions or control areas in the upper airspace Recommendation.— Where it is desirable to limit the number of flight information regions or control areas through which high flying aircraft would otherwise have to operate, a flight information region or control area, as appropriate, should be delineated to include the upper airspace within the lateral limits of a number of lower flight information regions or control areas. Although the recommendation from Annex 11 above is worded in quite a complex way, it is not as complex as it looks. As high flying aircraft are moving fast and going long distances, and it is unnecessary for them to fly through many different FIRs or control areas, upper FIRs (UIRs) should be made, which encompass the upper airspace of multiple lower level FIRs. Therefore, upper FIRs are much larger than standard FIRs, so the faster aircraft at high levels are not constantly changing from one FIR to the next. See the annex above, France have multiple FIRs at lower levels, but only a single \"France UIR\" for high levels. In terms of answering this question, the correct answer is stated almost exactly in the recommendation above, the purpose of having larger upper FIRs are \"To limit the amount of FIRs a high-flying aircraft must operate in\".",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 010.07.02.05.05: State why clearances must be issued ‘early enough’ to aircraft. Source: ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 4, 4.5 Air traffic control clearances, 4.5.1 Scope and purpose ICAO Doc. 4444 (PANS-ATM) 4.5 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCES 4.5.1 Scope and Purpose 4.5.1.1 Clearances are issued solely for expediting and separating air traffic and are based on known traffic conditions which affect safety in aircraft operation. Such traffic conditions include not only aircraft in the air and on the manoeuvring area over which control is being exercised, but also any vehicular traffic or other obstructions not permanently installed on the manoeuvring area in use. 4.5.1.2 If an air traffic control clearance is not suitable to the pilot-in-command of an aircraft, the flight crew may request and, if practicable, obtain an amended clearance. 4.5.1.3 The issuance of air traffic control clearances by air traffic control units constitutes authority for an aircraft to proceed only in so far as known air traffic is concerned. ATC clearances do not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations for promoting the safety of flight operations or for any other purpose; neither do clearances relieve a pilot-in-command of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations. 4.5.1.4 ATC units shall issue such ATC clearances as are necessary to prevent collisions and to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic. 4.5.1.5 ATC clearances must be issued early enough to ensure that they are transmitted to the aircraft in sufficient time for it to comply with them. Note: You could consider the answer about separation to also be correct, as clearances are issued for the separation of traffic, so that will always be their base function, but that would be quite a reach. The question directly refers to the regulation in bold above (via the LO above), that the clearances must be issued early enough to allow the pilots to comply with it, so we see that as the most correct answer by far.",

The ATC unit should then coordinate with the flight crew the following: a) the route to be flown, which, if possible, should be clear of cities and towns, preferably over water and away from areas where thunderstorms have been reported or are expected; b) the level to be used, which should be not less than 1800 m (6000 ft); and c) the duration of the fuel dumping. During flight planning the pilot takes into account the maximum take off and landing mass of the aircraft to determine the maximum cargo and fuel load applicable. In case of an emergency, the fuel burnt might not be enough to allow the aircraft to land with a mass less than the maximum landing mass, and fuel dumping may be the solution to reduce the mass.

Therefore, please send any further exam feedback you have about this one to us in the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. As this is a new question to us, we would prefer to give you an idea of what they may ask, rather than wait for further feedback. ICAO Annex 11 - Chapter 4 4.3.4 Voice-automatic terminal information service (Voice-ATIS) broadcasts 4.3.4.1 Voice-automatic terminal information service (Voice-ATIS) broadcasts shall be provided at aerodromes where there is a requirement to reduce the communication load on the ATS VHF air-ground communication channels. When provided, they shall comprise: a) one broadcast serving arriving aircraft; or b) one broadcast serving departing aircraft; or c) one broadcast serving both arriving and departing aircraft; or d) two broadcasts serving arriving and departing aircraft respectively at those aerodromes where the length of a broadcast serving both arriving and departing aircraft would be excessively long. 4.3.4.2 A discrete VHF frequency shall, whenever practicable, be used for Voice-ATIS broadcasts. If a discrete frequency is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel(s) of the most appropriate terminal navigation aid(s), preferably a VOR, provided the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the navigation aid is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated. 4.3.4.3 Voice-ATIS broadcasts shall not be transmitted on the voice channel of an ILS. 4.3.4.4 Whenever Voice-ATIS is provided, the broadcast shall be continuous and repetitive. 4.3.4.5 The information contained in the current broadcast shall immediately be made known to the ATS unit(s) concerned with the provision to aircraft of information relating to approach, landing and takeoff, whenever the message has not been prepared by that (those) unit(s). 4.3.4.6 Voice-ATIS broadcasts provided at designated aerodromes for use by international air services shall be available in the English language as a minimum. 4.3.4.7 Recommendation.— Where Voice-ATIS broadcasts are available in more than one language, a discrete channel should be used for each language. 4.3.4.8 Recommendation.— The Voice-ATIS broadcast message should, whenever practicable, not exceed 30 seconds, care being taken that the readability of the ATIS message is not impaired by the speed of the transmission or by the identification signal of a navigation aid used for transmission of ATIS. The ATIS broadcast message should take into consideration human performance. To go through the options: \"in English only, for departure and arrival traffic, lasting one minute.\" Incorrect. 4.3.4.6 above dictates the rules for languages, and it is not \"English only\". They should also not exceed 30 seconds where practical, as per recommendation 4.3.4.8. \"for arrival traffic only, on the ILS localiser frequency.\" Incorrect. They can be broadcast to arrival and departure aircraft, and NEVER using the ILS frequency. \"for arrival traffic only, preferably on the VOR frequency.\" Incorrect. They can be broadcast to arrival and departure aircraft, on a discreet VHF requency if available, but if they have to be used on a radio aid frequency, then it should preferably be a VOR. There is a little more truth in this one than the above options, but we still consider it to be incorrect. \"for arrival and departure traffic, preferably on a discreet VHF frequency.\" Correct, but we made it up due to a gap in feedback, so it is not what you will see in the exam.",

The band normally used for voice communication is defined between 118.000 and 136.975 MHz, which covers its use for commercial and general aviation, air traffic control and other uses. This band is a sub-part of the VHF frequency band. The VHF propagation is practically straight-line propagation (similar to light waves). Therefore, the VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. When, due to shadowing (e.g. by a hill), VHF communication is not possible, it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band.

Source: ICAO Doc 4444, Chapter 15, 15.5.1 Strayed or unidentified aircraft ICAO Doc 4444 (PANS-ATM) 15.5.1 Strayed or unidentified aircraft Note 1.— The terms “strayed aircraft” and “unidentified aircraft” in this paragraph have the following meanings: Strayed aircraft. An aircraft which has deviated significantly from its intended track or which reports that it is lost. Unidentified aircraft. An aircraft which has been observed or reported to be operating in a given area but whose identity has not been established. Note 2.— An aircraft may be considered, at the same time, as a “strayed aircraft” by one unit and as an “unidentified aircraft” by another unit. Note 3.— A strayed or unidentified aircraft may be suspected as being the subject of unlawful interference. See Annex 11, 2.25.1 Obviously the correct answer here does not line up exactly with the definition above, but it is quite close and certainly the most correct answer.

Also, noise abatement may be a factor for the choice of runway, however this must always come secondarily to safety factors. Thankfully, this scenario is quite easy, as the pilot's aircraft does not have the required take-off performance to depart on Runway 22, so they must request a departure from Runway 04 instead (assuming there is only a single runway). ATC may not be able to accommodate this request, but they should attempt to do so. The options are therefore no departure or a departure from Runway 04, as the pilot cannot depart from Runway 22. This would be a cleared departure from Runway 04, the option including the incident report is ridiculous.",

The degree of risk involved in an aircraft proximity should be determined in the incident investigation and classified as “risk of collision”, “safety not assured”, “no risk of collision” or “risk not determined”. 16.3.3 When an accident/incident investigative authority conducts an investigation of an aircraft proximity incident, the air traffic services aspects should be included.
