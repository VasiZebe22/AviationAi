Autopilot Heading Mode The simplest nav mode is to have the aircraft keep flying in the direction you select, this is called Heading Mode. In this mode the pilot selects a desired heading, either using a knob on the HSI, using the central FDS/autopilot panel or on the MCP. The Flight Director roll bar commands the aeroplane to fly to the Pre- Selected Heading, and subsequently to hold that heading. To achieve this, the computer receives inputs from the attitude reference source, the VG, and the course from the compass system. If the heading source is purely magnetic, the Autopilot will follow the heading regarding this source. If is is incorrect, the autopilot will follow an incorrect heading. Having two flux-valves with combined outputs, is used to reduce errors which otherwise may be present in systems using single pendulously mounted magnetic field responsive devices.",

At lift-off, the pitch command continues at 15° nose-up until sufficient climb rate is acquired. Pitch then commands MCP speed (normally V2) plus 20 knots. This speed is calculated and set during the pre-flight checks. The roll command maintains HDG SEL - the roll mode keeps the aircraft aligned with the runway heading. Next, when either autopilot is engaged or when the MCP speed selector is rotated, 20 kt IAS is added automatically to the MCP IAS display.",

The Go-around mode is one of the three mixed modes mentioned in the EASA LOs above, with the other two being take-off and approach modes. All three of these modes interact with the autothrottle and autopilot systems to achieve the desired outcomes. When the A/T ARM switch is turned on, the A/T go-around mode becomes active below 2000 feet RA, whether or not the AFDS is engaged. Once activated, the A/T go-around mode remains available for engagement until 2 seconds after touchdown. To engage this mode, you simply press the TOGA switch. When engaged, \"GA\" is displayed for the A/T, and the thrust levers move to the reduced go-around thrust setting, resulting in a climb rate of 1000 to 2000 feet per minute. Pressing the TOGA switch a second time causes the A/T to advance the thrust to the full go-around N1 limit. On Boeing aircraft, this entails pressing TOGA, while on Airbus planes, it involves moving the throttles into the TOGA detent. In either case, the engines power up to full thrust, and the autopilot disengages the approach mode, allowing the aircraft to climb away from the ground. It's important to note that the Go-around mode is not constrained by specific altitudes or heights. Therefore, if the pilot initiates a go-around, the aircraft will climb regardless of whether it is below or above the pre-selected missed approach altitude.",

VERTICAL SPEED An aircraft's vertical speed is the positive or negative rate of altitude change with respect to time. This is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon). FLIGHT PATH VECTOR The circular symbol represents the aircraft's axis in relation to the vertical and lateral movement referenced to the Earth's surface. If you were stationary on the ground, the circle would be on the horizon line and centred in the display. The data received by the FPV is derived mostly from the Internal Reference System (IRS) of the aircraft; therefore, the Flight Path Vector provides an almost instantaneous display of flight path angle and drift information.",

While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

Periodic checks on all ILS equipped runways ensure that the ILS signal quality is at the required level inside a defined envelope. Capturing the ILS glide slope within this envelope ensures that the aircraft is within the area of influence for the primary glide slope. It also ensures that the ILS signal is of sufficient quality to ensure a normal ILS glide slope capture. The ICAO envelope (fig.4) is within: 10 NM from the runway threshold +/-8° laterally from the runway centerline 0.3 x Θ up to 1.75 x Θ (Θ, being the nominal glide path angle). Make sure the aircraft is in the correct ILS envelope. Arming the approach too soon may cause a false Glide Slope interception out of the protected area, making the airplane descend outside the normal glide slope capture zone. Further information: Secondary glide slopes are an inevitable characteristic due to the ILS antenna design. When an aircraft flies well above the main glide slope, the glide slope deviations displayed on the PFD will refer to the nearest glide slope, which may be a secondary glide slope instead of the primary one. This can lead both the flight crew and the autopilot to erroneously consider the secondary glide slope as the reference for the final descent.",

Therefore, besides the autopilot (for obvious reasons) it is the primary source of information during an automatic landing. The transition from one phase to another during the autoland is based on the height measured by the radio altimeter. For example, at 50 ft AGL the glideslope signal is disconnected, and between 50 ft AGL and touch down, the autopilot will keep a vertical speed depending on the radio altimeter height, as this is more precise than the barometric altitude. The higher the VS the sooner the aircraft will start to flare. The auto-thrust is also incorporated in the Autoland system as this provides automatic speed control until touchdown. The pilot will retard the thrust levers at about 10-20 ft (RA) before touchdown.",

Unfortunately, we haven't been able to obtain this image as of now. When we do acquire it, this question will be updated accordingly. Thank you for your understanding! The primary distinction between the Flight Director System (FDS) and the autopilot lies in their operational roles. The FDS exclusively offers control and guidance instructions to either the pilot or the autopilot, whereas the autopilot physically controls the aircraft's surfaces. The FDS, however, serves as a precise means of cross-verifying the control and guidance commands sent to the autopilot. The FDS can be employed in the following ways: • Flight director mode only: In this scenario, the pilot manually operates the flight controls, adhering to the FDS commands. This typically occurs during the final stages of an approach, particularly for non-automated landings. • Autopilot mode only: Here, the pilot provides sensory guidance to the autopilot via the aircraft's control column/stick. This often happens when pilots are using the autopilot in control wheel steering (CWS) mode. • Flight director and autopilot mode: In this mode, the autopilot adjusts the aircraft's control surfaces in response to the steering commands issued by the FDS. This is common during cruising and most other phases of a commercial transport flight. The modes and control panel are the same for both the Flight Director (FD) and the autopilot. The FD will present on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) the instructions that the autopilot is following to meet the preset parameters.",

At 30 ft RA, the AP/FD aligns the yaw axis with the runway centreline and the aircraft flares on the pitch axis. If the autothrust is active, thrust is automatically reduced to IDLE. When both AP/FDs are disengaged, FLARE mode disengages. After main landing gear touchdown, the autopilot (if engaged) sends a nose down order. FLARE MODE - Boeing The A/P flare manoeuvre starts at approximately 50 feet RA and is completed at touchdown: FLARE engaged is annunciated and F/D command bars retract. the A/T begins retarding thrust at approximately 27 feet RA so as to reach idle at touchdown. A/T FMA annunciates RETARD. the A/T automatically disengages approximately 2 seconds after touchdown. the A/P must be manually disengaged after touchdown.

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

Upon LOC capture, VOR/LOC (\"LOC\" in the airbus) annunciates captured (engaged) in green - fig.2. Glideslope capture is inhibited prior to localizer capture. Capture occurs at 2/5 dot and results in the G/S annunciating captured (in green) - fig.3. Shortly after capturing LOC or G/S and below 1500 ft RA, \"FLARE\" armed is annunciated (in white) - fig.4. The A/P flare maneuver starts at approximately 50 ft RA and is completed at touchdown: FLARE engaged is annunciated and F/D command bars retract - fig.5. The A/T begins retarding thrust at approximately 27 ft RA so as to reach idle at touchdown. A/T FMA annunciates \"RETARD\" (\"THR IDLE\" in the airbus) - fig.6.

Active and preselected lateral and vertical modes of the flight director or autopilot. Automatic landing capacity, if installed. Autothrottle modes. Failure and alert messages (including autoflight system disengagement). The pilot should monitor the controls and displays. This enables him/her to predict and anticipate the entire sequence of FMA across the flight phase. In this case, it is possible that the mode change was actually scheduled.",

Please let us know if you see this in the Instrumentation exam, thank you! The Fly-By-Wire system has multiple redundancies that offer layered protection: Normal Law offers all the protections (like stall, load factor etc). This is the system in operation during normal flights. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode Flight Mode Flare Mode Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability, load factor and stall protections. Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a very poor question and as yet, we do not know the precise wording of the question in the real exam. The options are closely corroborated between different counts of feedback, but given the question has very little information, we originally chose the only answer we could make any sense out of as correct. Recently, feedback in the comments has indicated that this answer was correct, which is encouraging to see, but please continue to send any feedback about the correct answer or the question wording, thank you! So far, we think this question could be asking about 3 different things, the last of which is our best guess: How the autopilot works out the magnitude of aileron/roll spoiler inputs to use in roll modes. How the autopilot works out the maximum bank angle. How the autopilot works out how much bank angle to use for a specific turn. 1) In this question, the autopilot mainly takes input from the IAS/CAS, as the higher the CAS, the more sensitive the controls will be, so the lass aileron/roll spoiler input needed. It may also take altitude into account, due to the low aerodynamic damping at high altitude, which may be taken into consideration. Of course, the precise amount of deflection needed is created using a feedback loop, but the autopilot does need some inputs to make the process better. 2) In managed lateral modes (sometimes called LNAV for lateral navigation), the autopilot chooses the maximum bank angle that it can use independently of the pilots, and this takes into account high altitude effects, restrictions whilst at low altitude, etc. For this, it will use altitude input, and perhaps CAS/Mach No. inputs, but crucially, we do NOT think this requires a TAS or vertical speed input, as they would not give any useful information to our knowledge. 3) The managed lateral (LNAV) modes mentioned above calculate what angle of bank to perform a turn at, in order to make that turn correctly, following the calculated path. This requires input of the aircraft TAS, as well as some distances (from waypoint to waypoint, aircraft to waypoint, aircraft to the track when intercepting, etc.). As far as we can tell, this is the only interpretation of the question that actually gives a somewhat correct answer, even though the interpretation is a bit of a push and the answer is very vague, so we certainly do not like it.",

The successful completion of an automatic landing depends on various items such as the crosswind, headwind, tailwind, runway contamination, etc. that need to be within a certain range. Beyond the certified range of these variables, the automatic landing cannot be completed safely. As surprising as it might be, the Autoland capability can be useful on other occasions. For example, when both flight crew experience extreme fatigue and don’t take the risk of landing manually the aircraft, they can agree on an automatic landing. Obviously, this is not because the pilot flying will misjudge the flare or anything that is linked with the manual skills (although it could also be the cause), but mostly because if a go-around were to be executed, the autopilot would greatly reduce the workload and help the pilots to seat back and carefully manage the flight path of the airplane, flaps retraction, and missed approach procedure monitoring.",

With CWS engaged, the A/P manoeuvres the aeroplane in response to control pressures applied by either pilot. The control pressure is similar to that required for manual flight. When control pressure is released, the A/P holds existing attitude. Touch Control Steering (TCS) Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch or roll, but unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while the TCS button is held depressed allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in the desired attitude using manual control.

The required visual reference for a manual landing is elements of the approach light system, threshold, threshold markings, threshold identification lights, visual glideslope indicator (PAPI), touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights and runway edge lights. The issue with this question is that typically in a large transport aircraft, ‘FLARE’ mode would engage at around 30/50 ft radio altitude. The time delay between 30/50 ft RA and touchdown is around 2 seconds. So, for the pilot monitoring to call “NO FLARE” and the pilot flying to take manual control and land at this late stage is basically impossible. Should the ‘FLARE’ mode not activate, the likely scenario would be for the aircraft to continue to descend and autoland onto the runway with a rate of descent of approximately 700 fpm. A firm but likely safe landing would arise. Alternatively, the pilot flying may wish to execute a go around/baulked landing manoeuvrer. Note: You may wish to consider appealing the question, depending on the wording in your actual exam. Alternatively consider that the remaining ‘incorrect’ options suggest taking manual control after the landing, which by then is too late.",

The visual reference is basically either the physical runway, its markings (paint) or an element of the approach lighting. In real life, it will be the lights that will shine to find you first. If the required visual reference can not be established at DH, then a Go-Around will result. However, the Go-Around mode can be selected above DH if needed and infact even once landed. For example, on the B737 the mode remains available up to 2 seconds after touch down.

The gyros will then send a signal to a detector (=signal processor) that is proportional to the rate of change of attitude. The detector that has received this signal will compute a corrective signal and will send it to the elevator servo motors. After the elevator has been moved, feedback of the elevator position is sent to the detector so that the actual position of the elevator and the required one is compared. If the elevator still hasn’t achieved its required position, the detector unit will compute another corrective signal proportional to the new displacement. This feedback operation will continue until the elevator hasn’t achieved the required position.",

FAIL-OPERATIONAL AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the remaining part of the automatic system allows the aircraft to complete the approach, flare, and landing. In the event of a failure, the automatic landing system operates as a fail-passive system. FAIL-PASSIVE AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM An automatic landing system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail passive means in case of a failure of any part of the system, the autoland system will turn itself off and the crew has to take over. An example of an autoland sequence: - Approach (APP) mode armed - Localizer and Glide Slope Armed - Localizer Capture - Glide Slope Capture - 400 - 330 feet RA: If FLARE is armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage. - At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA: The FLARE mode is automatically engaged - Roll-out FAILURES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS As a general rule, if a failure occurs above 1000 ft AGL, the approach may be continued if all required actions are completed, the updated approach briefing is performed and the appropriate Decision heigh/altitude set. Below 1000 ft (and down to Alert Height), the occurrence of any failure requires a go around and a reassessment of the landing capability. It has been considered that below 1000 ft, not enough time is available for the crew to perform the necessary switching, to check system configuration and limitation and brief for minima.",

The AP and FD pitch modes can control a target SPD/MACH or a vertical trajectory, and the A/THR mode can control a fixed thrust or a target SPD/MACH. However, the AP/FD and the A/THR cannot both control a target SPD/MACH simultaneously. Therefore the AP/FD pitch modes and A/THR mode are coordinated as follows: ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a vertical trajectory, the A/THR mode controls the target SPD/MACH. ‐ If an AP/FD pitch mode controls a target SPD or MACH, the A/THR mode controls the thrust. ‐ If no AP/FD pitch mode is engaged, the A/THR mode reverts to controlling the SPD/MACH mode. In other words, the selection of an AP/FD pitch mode determines which mode the A/THR controls. The FMGS has guidance parameters for both AP/FD lateral and vertical modes. The AP/FD lateral modes are the same. Two types of autopilot and flight director modes are available to guide the aircraft: ‐ One that steers the aircraft along the lateral, vertical, and speed profiles according to the data the pilot inserts into the MCDU. Flight Management (in the Flight Management and Guidance Computer) computes the corresponding guidance targets. ‐ The other that steers the aircraft according to target values that the pilot selects and the FCU windows display.",

Its purpose being to enable the pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch and/or roll, through the automatic control system without disconnecting the autopilot. The signals for the A/P are produced by transducers in the control column. Pressing a CWS engage switch, engages the A/P pitch and roll axes in the CWS mode and displays CWS P and CWS R on the FMAs. With CWS engaged, the A/P manoeuvres the aeroplane in response to control pressures applied by either pilot. The control pressure is similar to that required for manual flight. When control pressure is released, the A/P holds existing attitude. Touch Control Steering (TCS) Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre their aircraft in pitch or roll, but unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while the TCS button is held depressed allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft in the desired attitude using manual control. The autopilot control channels and servomotors are re-engaged by release of the TCS button and the autopilot continues to again hold the aircraft in the attitude in which it was left.",

These conditions vary slightly between autopilots, but take the form of a number of switches called interlocks, connected in series. A list of some of the conditions that must be operative before the interlocks allow autopilot engagement is as follows: - AC and DC power supplies in tolerance - Trimmed and erected gyroscopes - Yaw damper system engaged - Automatic pitch trim system available - Mach trim system available - Do not press instinctive Cut-Out (Disengage buttons) - Operative CADC - Stabilizer Trim Autopilot Cut-out Switch is at NORMAL. - Manual controls in their neutral position (i.e. Control wheel and column, turn knob, pitch switch).

            "explanation": "AUTOMATION Aircraft are equipped with several levels of automation, used to perform specific tasks. The appropriate use of automated systems significantly helps the flight crew with, for example: - Workload management - Situation awareness (traffic, ATC communication, etc.). The flight crew must, at all times, perform both of the following: - Determine and select the appropriate level of automation that can include manual flight - Understand the operational effect of the selected level of automation. SITUATION AWARENESS (SAW) Situation Awareness (SAW) relates to a pilot’s ability to develop and maintain an accurate mental model of his/her operational status. This includes the aircraft’s position in time and space, its technical status, including the potential effects of any abnormalities, and the impact of environmental factors on present and future operations. CRM “CRM is the effective utilization of all available resources to achieve safe and efficient flight operations”. CRM is all about using resources to effectively manage two sources of risk in the operational environment: - THREATS to flight safety and - Human ERRORS THREAT AND ERROR MANAGEMENT(TEM) The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework for understanding operational performance. According to the TEM model, Threats, Errors, and Undesired Aircraft States (UAS) are everyday events that flight crews must manage to maintain safety. Aircraft Handling Errors Errors associated with the flight path and configuration of the aircraft (e.g.automation errors, mis-selections, incorrect speed, heading, altitude, etc.). ERROR MANAGEMENT AVOID – Use the protective mechanisms built into operational policies and procedures, as well as core competencies, to minimize the possibility of error (e.g. adhere to procedures, SOPs, briefings, etc.) TRAP – Recognize and correct errors, before they become cumulative or consequential, by proper crosschecking, monitoring, using checklists, etc. MITIGATE – Lessen the effect of errors that have not been avoided or trapped by changing your course of action e.g. going around, diverting, holding, etc.",

When in the plane, the Captain sits on the left-hand side and the First Officer sits on the right-hand side. Before each flight the crew agrees on which pilot will act as the Pilot Flying (PF) and which will act as the Pilot Monitoring (PM) for that particular flight. Each of them has a different area of responsibility in the cockpit. The Pilot Flying (PF) must concentrate on \"flying the aircraft\" to monitor and control the pitch attitude, bank angle, airspeed, thrust, sideslip, heading, etc., in order to achieve and maintain the desired targets, vertical flight path, and lateral flight path. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) must assist the PF and must actively monitor flight parameters, call out any excessive deviation and is responsible for radio communication with ATC, flight attendants, and passengers. Furthermore, he/she maintains the flight plan, monitors fuel, reads checklists, and operates the landing gear and flaps. Therefore, both flight crewmembers must: • Focus and concentrate on their tasks to ensure appropriate task sharing • Maintain situational awareness and immediately resolve any uncertainty as a crew.",

By definition, PIO (or APC) cannot happen unless the pilot is making inputs that are sustaining the oscillation. Consequently, the first and most critical step for exiting PIO is to get out of the loop.

Generally speaking, when Pilot Flying (PF) is manually flying the aircraft, he/she asks the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to change any short-term (though FCU) or long-term (through MCDU) revisions. In this situation, a DIRECT TO 'POL' was instructed by ATC. As this is a long-term revision, the PM should insert it through the MCDU. This shall be confirmed by a mode change to NAV on the FMA, the PF then follows the Flight Director (FD) command bars. If no change to NAV is observed, the PM can ask the PF for a heading change in the direction of 'POL', which then is confirmed by an FMA mode change to HDG and the PF follows the command bars to the selected heading.",

The term \"servomechanism\" (sometimes shortened to \"servo\") could be defined as: An automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the performance of a mechanism and is defined by its function. In other words, a servo-system operates on the principle of using a some sort of detection device to automatically monitor the state of a particular system or a component (parameters, position, etc.). Any difference between the detected values and desired values is treated as an error condition. In such cases the difference value (error signal) is amplified and then used by the corrective mechanism (e.g. an electric motor) to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error. Servos are frequently used in the position control systems. They are typically electrical or partially electronic in nature, using an electric motor as the primary means of creating the mechanical corrective force. Other types of servos use hydraulics, pneumatics, or magnetic principles. In aircraft systems, we can usually find servo-mechanisms in the autopilot systems (e.g. position control of the respective flight control surfaces), instruments (e.g. maintaining the vertical of a gyroscope), etc. Note: if you still have difficulties grasping the understanding of the principle behind a \"servo\" then let's take a look at two common car systems: • Electrically Controlled Car Windows: When you press the button to move the car window up or down, an electric motor is operated to move the actual window pane. Is this another example of a servo-system? No, because the action (e.g. motor opening the window) was based on a manual user input => you had to press the \"open\" button to get that window down. • Car Cruise Control System: You are driving down the highway and you set your cruise control at 130 km/h (desired state). The highway starts to go uphill suddenly and your cruise control system immediately detects the speed starting to decrease (detection mechanism). In other words, an error occurred - there is a difference between the desired and actually detected states. The system, therefore, applies a force to eliminate this error => the cruise control system adds more gas to compensate for the uphill terrain and brings the speed back up to the preselected usually so quickly the driver doesn't even notice any speed drop. Is this an example of a servo system? Of course, it is - we have an automatic error detection + error correction.",

The Pilot Flying (PF) must concentrate on \"flying the aircraft\" to monitor and control the pitch attitude, bank angle, airspeed, thrust, sideslip, heading, etc., in order to achieve and maintain the desired targets, vertical flight path, and lateral flight path. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) must assist the PF and must actively monitor flight parameters, call out any excessive deviation and is responsible for radio communication with ATC, flight attendants, and passengers. Furthermore, he/she maintains the flight plan, monitors fuel, reads checklists, and operates the landing gear and flaps.

Fail passive - The automatic landing system is fed by only two fail-safe autopilots comparing their computations, therefore it cannot determine which one of the units is delivering the correct steering commands. In the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system. Therefore, looking at each option: \"maintain safe flight, but is unable to complete the automatic landing.\" Correct. Whilst the \"maintain safe flight\" is debatable, as the autopilot will eventually disconnect to allow the pilots to perform the landing manually or make a go-around, the fail passive system makes sure that there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, which you could consider to mean that it is safe flight, and the aircraft is not able to complete the autoland after such a problem. It is therefore most correct. \"complete the automatic landing, including the landing roll-out to a full stop.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system. \"maintain safe flight, providing the autoland capability but without auto-flare.\" The autoland capability doesn't exist without auto-flare, and the autoland capability is gone when a fail-passive system has a failure of some kind. \"complete the automatic landing, but unable to provide roll-out guidance.\" The aircraft can no longer complete the automatic landing after a failure on a fail-passive system.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 022.06.05.01.08: Describe how the failure of various systems, including systems not directly involved in the autoland process, can influence the ability to perform an autoland or affect the minima down to which the approach may be conducted. This is the third similar question about this topic we have in our database, and all appear to have quite significantly different options at least. Failure or malfunctions of any of the systems required to perform an automatic landing can result in a degradation of autoland performance. Additionally, systems which are not directly involved in the autoland sequency can also affect the ability to perform automatic landing and sometimes result in higher minima. Thus, the pilot must check the relevant manuals, such as the FCOM, QRH or MEL to verify whether the failure has any impact on the aircraft's approach capability. In case the defect causes a reduction in the aircraft's approach capability, a diversion or higher decision height and/or RVR might be necessary. Whilst I have never personally seen an aircraft or company procedure that requires windshield heating to be available for autoland, there are often requirements for windshield wipers to be operative, etc., as visual reference can be very important in the late stages of the approach and the landing. To go through each option: \"Yes, because the windshield heating system is not essential for the autoland procedure.\" This is not necessarily always the case, and we cannot just assume that the windshield heating system is not a part of the required equipment. \"No, because autoland requires all aircraft systems to be fully operational.\" Not always; the autoland has a certain amount of required equipment, but not everything is necessary. The specific requirements will be laid out in the company or aircraft manuals. \"Yes, as long as the weather conditions are clear, and there is no need for visibility enhancement.\" Well the whole point of an autoland is an automatically flown approach and landing in poor visibility, so the weather conditions are not clear. \"No, unless approved by the airline's manuals and the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures are followed.\" Correct (mostly). We have to assume \"no\" until we find the list of required equipment for the autoland in the manuals, or reference documents such as the QRH for any restrictions caused by the loss of windshield heating. After checking these, only then can we perform the autoland if we are happy that it is allowed with such a defect. MEL procedures need not be followed as the problem has been found in the air, and MEL is a document used to check requirements before dispatch. Nonetheless, this is the most correct answer.",

The Fail-Operational Automatic Landing System A fail-operational automatic landing system is defined as the capability of a system to withstand a failure without affecting the overall functioning of the system and without causing degradation of performance beyond the limits required for an automatic landing. The system requires a minimum of three autopilots. Alert Height The alert height is a specified radio altimeter height, based on the characteristics of the aircraft and its fail operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aircraft, the approach would be discontinued, and a go-around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored, and the approach would be continued to complete the autoland. If below the alert height all autopilots disengage, the ILS signal or components are lost, excessive ILS deviations occur, or the radio-altimeter fails, a warning will be triggered and an autoland procedure will not be possible. Fail passive - The automatic landing system is fed by only two fail-safe autopilots comparing their computations, therefore it cannot determine which one of the units is delivering the correct steering commands. In the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude, but the landing is not completed automatically. Fail operational - The automatic landing system consists of three independent autopilot channels per controlled axis, it is capable of determining the failed component and excluding it from the computation. In the event of a failure, the approach, flare, and landing can be completed by the remaining part of the automatic system.",

The corresponding A/THR mode is SPEED or MACH. The V/S (FPA) guidance has priority over the speed guidance. If the selected target V/S or FPA is too high (relative to the current thrust condition and speed), the FMGC will steer the aircraft to the target V/S or FPA, but the aircraft will also accelerate or decelerate. VERTICAL SPEED An aircraft's vertical speed is the positive or negative rate of altitude change with respect to time. This is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). The Vertical Speed in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). FLIGHT PATH ANGLE (figure 2) The Flight Path Angle is the angle between the Aircraft’s Velocity Vector and the Horizon. If you are flying in a level flight your Flight Path Angle will be zero (over the horizon), regardless of the Pitch Angle. During a descent, the Flight Path Angle will be negative (below the horizon) thus when climbing the Flight Path Angle will be positive (over the horizon).

In other words, it off-loads any steady state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes.

In other words, it off-loads any steady state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto-synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

It actually starts with a yawing motion at a rate that is characteristic for every affected aircraft type and is referred to as the Dutch roll frequency. The advancing wing creates more lift than the retreating one and this causes the aircraft to roll to the side of the yawing motion. As a result, this roll induces further yaw to the opposite side, larger than the initial yaw angle, causing a larger roll, which results in an increased adverse yaw effect, and so on. These aircraft must feature a yaw damper system in order to counteract this Dutch roll tendency. Yaw damper systems feature rate gyroscopes in the horizontal axis, and sometimes accelerometers, to determine the rate of any aircraft yaw. It uses this data along with the CAS to cause a deflection of the rudder that stops the yawing motion before the aircraft starts to roll. Yawing motions act around the aircraft’s normal axis, therefore only a rate gyro in the horizontal plane would be able to detect this left/right movement of the airframe when viewed from above. An Inertial Reference System (IRS) installed on larger transport aircraft typically feature 3 rate gyros, each in one of the 3 axis centred around the aircraft centre of gravity; normal, longitudinal and lateral axis. As a result, the IRS could be a source of yawing data for the yaw damper system, depending on the aircraft type.",

The yaw damper system uses the angular rate signal about the yaw axis to control the rudder. A yaw damper indicator in the cockpit supplies the flight crew with the yaw damper action on the rudder. A computer sends a motion order to the rudder if the yaw rate of the aircraft is not equal to zero. In other words, it is moving the rudder without moving the rudder pedals. It is designed to reduce the roll ratio in the Dutch roll oscillations. The yaw damper system is operative during both manual, and automatic flight.",

Fly-By-Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a fully powered flight control system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. Advantages of Fly-By-Wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Auto-trim will continuously change the \"zero point\" of the flight control system, and therefore needs no input from the pilot usually, reducing workload. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure G forces out of the limits. Auto-trim will continuously change the \"zero point\" of the flight control system, and therefore needs no input from the pilot usually, reducing workload. It operates within the usual flight envelope as an integral part of the Fly-By-Wire system, and operates just fine with flaps/slats extended or retracted.",

Automatic trim is typically achieved by a separate trim servo actuator, operating the variable incidence horizontal stabiliser which allows the elevator to always be in the neutral position. In the event of a failure of the trim system the pilots would be alerted by warning lights and/or suitable indications on the electronic display unit. At the same time the autopilot would disengage, giving both visual and aural alerts.",

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL Dutch roll is caused by the interplay between lateral stability around the longitudinal axis (roll) and longitudinal stability around the vertical axis (yaw) of an aircraft in flight. An aircraft with an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be susceptible to Dutch roll. YAW DAMPER To produce an aircraft that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes, a system to automatically counter Dutch roll must be installed. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system is called yaw damper. The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the third axis of autopilot control. The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn co-ordination, runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust. A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. DUTCH ROLL FILTER The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a yaw and act in opposition to produce an unco-ordinated turn. So the yaw damper system needs to be able to distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll. The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

However, in certain situations, such as during an emergency, the pilot may need to exceed the maximum speed limit to avoid a more serious safety threat. In some FBW aircraft, the pilot can override the overspeed protection by engaging an \"override\" button or switch, or in some aircraft, such as the A320, the sidestick can be held in the \"nose-down\" position to allow the pilot to override the overspeed protection. When the pilot engages the override function, the system temporarily disables the overspeed protection and allows the pilot to control the aircraft's speed manually. This should only be done with caution as exceeding the maximum speed limit can put stress on the aircraft's structure and may cause damage or loss of control. Additionally, overriding overspeed protection may trigger an alert or warning in the cockpit, notifying the pilot of the potential safety risk.",

Trimmers can runaway if they are electrically controlled and either have a malfunction, or if the engaged autopilot system has a malfunction and sends such a demand to the trim system. They can also runaway if the pilot switches become stuck, hence the need for a double pole switch to reduce that chance. Nonetheless, pilots must be aware of the dangers of trim runaway and ready to fix the issue, which usually includes the following actions: Disconnecting the autopilot and authrottle, if engaged. This may come with a large force change on the flight controls if the autopilot was masking a large out of trim position, so the pilots must hold the controls very firmly, and this out of trim condition may even require the force of both pilots at times to remain controlled. Switch off the electric trimmers. There is usually an electric trim cutout switch (or multiple) in the flight deck which removes the power to the trimmers. If the trimmers subsequently do not stop then the pilot monitoring may need to grasp the spinning trim wheel to stop a further runaway in some aircraft types. Manually fly the aircraft and manually manipulate the trim wheels. These may be quite heavy in large aircraft so may even require both pilots to manipulate the controls or trimmer.",

Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus A320 (the Fly-By-Wire aircraft most often referenced by EASA), the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, fly by wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, Their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, Alpha prot. = the aircraft pitch is set so that speed remains at or above this speed, unless the stick is manually pulled back, hence it will automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed if necessary Alpha floor = automatically applies TOGA thrust Alpha max = In normal law, this cannot be exceeded even by maximum stick deflection aft, to avoid a full stall. There is no stick shaker or stick pusher on fly-by-wire aircraft with side-sticks. The system would not revert to direct law as this removes all high alpha protections.",

The Mach trim system helps the aircraft to counteract the pitch down tendency caused by Mach tuck at a high Mach number.

            "explanation": "Mach trim is used to trim the aircraft at high Mach numbers (e.g. B737 from Mach.615). It prevents instability and tuck under (which appears above MCRIT) due to an increased pitch down moment, which is caused the following reasons: CP moves aft shock waves at the wing root reduced effectiveness of the tailplane Mach trim counteracts (increases pitch up) by one of the following: adjusting stabilizer adjusting elevator trim tank (fuel pumped to the tail) Outcome: stick force gradient will be maintained longitudinal stability will be increased tuck under will be avoided Mach Trim System relates to the pitch channel of the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS). It is designed as an AFCS sub-system and is therefore, like the yaw damper, operational irrespective of whether or not the AFCS is active (autopilot engaged or disengaged). The heart of the Mach trim system is the coupler unit. This receives signals, corresponding to Mach number, from the Air Data Computer (ADC). Whenever these signals exceed the pre-set value (for the aeroplane type) the trim coupler unit releases the brake and the speed signal from the ADC is fed to the motor. This causes the stabiliser to move in such a way that the elevators are driven upward, counteracting any tendency to a \"Mach Tuck-under\". Internal monitoring of the system provides a failure warning in the form of the illumination of a fail indicator light. Although connected to the pitch channel the system is totally independent of the pitch control channel of the AFCS. In other words, the Mach trim system provides speed stability at higher Mach numbers. It operates (adjusts the elevators with respect to the stabilizer as speed increases) only above certain minimum Mach number - for example on a B737-300 it is above Mach 0.615. With the Mach trim system INOP the maximum speed of the aircraft is typically limited to a lower Mach number than normally. \"Tuck-under\" is the phenomena encountered by aeroplanes flying at high subsonic, transonic or supersonic speeds. In these speed regimes there is typically a significant rearward movement of the Centre of Pressure (CP). In order to prevent this becoming an uncontrollable \"nose-down\" pitching motion, it is necessary to provide some form of compensation. This is done by the use of a Mach Trim System. Or otherwise said the Mach trim system allows to increase the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft by changing the horizontal stabilizer according to the Mach number.",

In other words, it off-loads any steady state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL Dutch roll is caused by the interplay between lateral stability around the longitudinal axis (roll) and longitudinal stability around the vertical axis (yaw) of an aircraft in flight. An aircraft with an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be susceptible to Dutch roll. YAW DAMPER To produce an aircraft that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes, a system to automatically counter Dutch roll must be installed. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system is called yaw damper. The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the third axis of autopilot control. The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn coordination, runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust. A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. DUTCH ROLL FILTER The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a yaw and act in opposition to produce an uncoordinated turn. So the yaw damper system needs to be able to distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll. The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL Dutch roll is caused by the interplay between lateral stability around the longitudinal axis (roll) and longitudinal stability around the vertical axis (yaw) of an aircraft in flight. An aircraft with an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be susceptible to Dutch roll. YAW DAMPER To produce an aircraft that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes, a system to automatically counter Dutch roll must be installed. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system is called yaw damper. The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the third axis of autopilot control. The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn co-ordination, runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust. A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. DUTCH ROLL FILTER The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a yaw and act in opposition to produce an unco-ordinated turn. So the yaw damper system needs to be able to distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll. The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but block other frequencies. While the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This results in no rudder demand. In an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency, since the rate of turn is constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The Dutch roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.",

Approach IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed.

In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS / Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the time it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED / MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed.

Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

Climb N1 hold autothrottle commands full thrust for climb and the desired speed is maintained by the AP pitch channel. Climb with V/S IAS hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Cruise / ALT hold IAS/MACH hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold autothrottle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. On a large commercial aircraft, the autothrottle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach Number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the autothrottle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the autothrottle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach Number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the times it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the autothrottle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the autothrottle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

Cruise / ALT hold IAS/MACH hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. On a large commercial aircraft, the auto-throttle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the times it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

On a large commercial aircraft, the autothrottle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach Number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the autothrottle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the autothrottle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach Number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the time it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations.",

The autothrust system, when active: ‐ Maintains a specific thrust in THRUST mode ‐ Controls the aircraft speed or Mach in SPEED/MACH mode ‐ Uses ALPHA FLOOR mode to set maximum thrust when the aircraft angle of attack exceeds a specific threshold. Autothrust Modes In THRUST mode, autothrust commands a specific thrust level in conjunction with the AP/FD pitch mode. This thrust level is limited by thrust lever position. THR MCT: Single engine thrust in climb. The live engine is at maximum continuous thrust (thrust lever in MCT detent) THR CLB: Climb thrust in two engine configuration (at least one thrust lever in the CL detent, the other one below CL) THR LVR: Undetermined thrust (neither CLB nor MCT thrust) THR IDLE: Minimum thrust (both engines at IDLE thrust) MAN TOGA: A/THR is armed, at least one thrust lever is in TOGA detent (and the associated engine is running). When the A/THR is armed for takeoff or go-around, the FMA displays “MAN TOGA” or “MAN FLX” in white to remind the flight crew that the thrust levers are properly positioned. Note: N1 is an Autothrottle mode in aircraft like Boeing 737. In this mode, the autothrottle maintains thrust at the selected N1 limit displayed on the thrust mode display, including full go-around N1 limit.",

Different aircraft manufacturers have varying names for their auto-thrust modes but they are still categorised as a speed or thrust modes. A SPEED mode is automatically selected when an autopilot flight director system (AFDS) vertical mode is controlling the aircrafts trajectory. In the cruise with ALT HOLD engaged the pitch channel will be maintaining the altitude so the IAS/Mach No will be maintained by the auto-thrust. To achieve this the autothrust has to vary the amount of thrust to maintain the airspeed. A THRUST mode is automatically commanded when the engaged AFDS vertical mode is controlling the airspeed. In a descent the airspeed is controlled by pitch and the auto-thrust sets and maintains idle thrust. A Thrust Mode will always set and maintain a specific thrust setting as opposed to the variable thrust used when in a speed mode The first figure shows a Boeing 737 Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) in the cruise with MCP SPD annunciated in the autothrust column. Speed is being maintained by the autothrust at the figure set on the pilots mode control panel (MCP) illustated by the purple bug on the ASI. This is a speed mode The second figure shows the aircraft in a descent, RETARD is annunciated in the autothrust column because the thrust has been retarded and is being maintained at idle. Speed is being controlled by pitch which is why MCP SPD is annunciated in the vertical mode column. This is a thrust mode.",

            "explanation": "On a large commercial aircraft, the autothrottle system usually has the following modes of operation: - SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach Number) - THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the autothrottle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach Number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the times it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the autothrottle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the autothrottle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator.",

The autothrust system, when active: ‐ Maintains a specific thrust in THRUST mode ‐ Controls the aircraft speed or Mach in SPEED/MACH mode ‐ Uses ALPHA FLOOR mode to set maximum thrust when the aircraft angle of attack exceeds a specific threshold. Autothrust Modes In THRUST mode, autothrust commands a specific thrust level in conjunction with the AP/FD pitch mode. This thrust level is limited by thrust lever position. THR MCT: Single engine thrust in climb. The live engine is at maximum continuous thrust (thrust lever in MCT detent) THR CLB: Climb thrust in two engine configurations (at least one thrust lever in the CL detent, the other one below CL) THR LVR: Undetermined thrust (neither CLB nor MCT thrust) THR IDLE: Minimum thrust (both engines at IDLE thrust) MAN TOGA: A/THR is armed, at least one thrust lever is in TOGA detent (and the associated engine is running). When the A/THR is armed for takeoff or go-around, the FMA displays “MAN TOGA” or “MAN FLX” in white to remind the flight crew that the thrust levers are properly positioned. Note: N1 is an Autothrottle mode in aircraft like Boeing 737. In this mode, the autothrottle maintains thrust at the selected N1 limit displayed on the thrust mode display, including full go-around N1 limit.",

Climb N1 hold auto-throttle commands full thrust for climb and the desired speed is maintained by the AP pitch channel. Climb with V/S IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Cruise / ALT hold IAS/MACH hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. Approach IAS hold auto-throttle continuously regulates the thrust output to maintain the required speed. On a large commercial aircraft, the auto-throttle system usually has the following modes of operation: SPEED/MACH mode (holding of IAS/Mach number) and THRUST mode (N1 or EPR hold). In fact, the autopilot pitch channel and the auto-throttle system work together. The operating mode of one will determine the operating mode of the other. For instance, when the auto-throttle is in the THRUST mode it will either command full or idle thrust. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the autopilot pitch channel in the climb/descent mode at a constant IAS or Mach number. The aircraft will basically use its kinetic energy to increase/decrease the rate of climb/descent. When take-off mode is engaged, the auto-throttle sets thrust to a pre-set, fixed thrust setting (N1 or EPR hold). Most of the times it is a computed flex thrust setting, but it can also be TOGA thrust if needed due to performance limitations. If the auto-throttle system is operating in the SPEED/MACH mode, the pitch channel of the autopilot will work independently. The speed will not be maintained by changing the pitch angle of the airplane anymore - the engines will simply regulate the required amount of thrust for the engines to deliver in order to maintain the required speed. The IAS/Mach hold mode is provided by the auto-throttle in the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD) or glide path mode. Another scenario where the auto-throttle can be operated in the SPEED mode (holding of IAS) is when the aircraft is in a climb with the autopilot engaged in the V/S mode (holding of vertical speed). Since the V/S mode is commanding the autopilot pitch channel to achieve a given rate of climb/descent, the pitch channel cannot be used anymore to maintain the speed. Therefore, the desired speed will be maintained by the auto-throttle system. In order to know in which mode the auto-throttle is engaged, the crew will check the FMA – Flight Mode Annunciator (=mode annunciator panel).",

Airspeed indications/trend vectors may give an indication of appropriate thrust adjustments but any reaction should not be too aggressive. Boeing 737 FCOM - Severe turbulence recommendations: Selection of the autopilot Control Wheel Steering (CWS) is recommended for operation in severe turbulence. Do not use Altitude Hold (ALT HLD) mode. The recommended procedures for flight in severe turbulence are: Airspeed - Target airspeed should be approximately 280 KIAS or 0.76 MACH, whichever is lower during climb or descent. If below 15 000 ft and the airplane gross weight is less than the maximum landing weight, the airplane may be slowed to 250 knots in the clean configuration during the descent. If in cruise, set turbulence penetration N1 as highlighted by TURB N1 on the Cruise page. Severe Turbulence will cause large and often rapid variations in indicated airspeed. Do not chase the airspeed. FMC N1 LIMIT page - Verify/Select CON Yaw Damper - Engaged Autopilot - Optional - If the autopilot is engaged, use CWS position, do not use ALT HLD mode Autothrottle - Disengage Attitude - Maintain wings level and the desired pitch attitude. Use the attitude indicator as the primary instrument. In extreme drafts, large attitude changes may occur. Do not use sudden large control inputs. After establishing the trim setting for penetration speed, do not change stabilizer trim Altitude - Allow the altitude to vary. Large altitude variations are possible in severe turbulence. Sacrifice altitude in order to maintain the desired attitude and airspeed. Do not chase the altitude. Thrust - Engine ignition should be on. Position the Engine Start switches to FLT. Make an initial thrust setting for the target airspeed. Change thrust only in case of extreme airspeed variation. The FMC cruise page displays N1 target value for turbulence.",

The transmission of signals from an earth station to a satellite or airborne platform is known as an Uplink. The transmission of signals from a satellite or airborne platform to an earth station is known as a Downlink. Automatic terminal information service, or ATIS, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Many airports also employ the use of Data-link ATIS (D-ATIS). D-ATIS is a text-based, digitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast. It is accessed via a data link service such as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft.",

A good example of an ATC application is the Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC). Different AOC application may include: - OOOI: messages which transmit actual off-block, take-off, landing and on-block times. - Load-sheet - Passenger information - Maintenance reports - Weather: Aircraft can request weather (METAR, TAF) for different airports, or request flight plan route weather, like wind information for the various route waypoints.

A compass is freely suspended in the horizontal plane and the needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles. As you approach the poles, the angle between magnetic flux and the horizon becomes vertical – compass ‘dip’ becomes a factor => decrease in horizontal magnetic field, increase in vertical magnetic field.

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle.

You’re currently maintaining a compass heading of 242°, therefore you look for this value in the lower line of the deviation table. The value above 242°, in the ‘to fly’ line is 240°. This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted. Therefore, the deviation is West.",

For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator.

The earth's magnetic field has two components or forces: a horizontal force parallel to the earth's surface that is used to align the compass with magnetic north and therefore to determine direction and a vertical force that causes the needle to dip down. At the magnetic equator, the horizontal force is dominant, and therefore, there is no dip and the compass is accurate. However, as you move closer to either of the magnetic poles, the vertical component increases, and this induces the magnetic bar in the compass to dip down to align itself vertically with the magnetic field. Lines joining points of equal dip are called isoclinic lines, or magnetic latitudes. There is a magnetic latitude roughly near the equator where the dip is zero (referred to as aclinic line).",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles. As you approach the poles, the angle between magnetic flux and the horizon becomes vertical – compass ‘dip’ becomes a factor => decrease in horizontal magnetic field, increase in vertical magnetic field.

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required.

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

            "explanation": "When accelerating in level flight, you would expect the artificial horizon (AH) to show wings level and a steady nose attitude. However, due to its construction, both the electrical and air driven AH will show a false attitude. This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems. The electrical AH will show a false climb. The air driven AH will show a false climb and a right turn. This question appears to be asking about an air driven version. The air-driven artificial horizon gives the pilot the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon and is part of the essential set of instruments in any aircraft. It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement. Note: Both AH show a false nose up when accelerating, as seen in many other questions. The 2021 Learning Objectives focus more on the effect of acceleration, rather than the cause. That said, the electrical AH uses mercury switches to maintain the gyro axis vertical. In normal operation, the mercury sits at the bottom of the switch and the circuit is open. During an acceleration, the mercury is pushed out of position and closes the switch, ultimately driving the gyro to show a false climb. An air driven AH uses a pendulous unit and vanes to maintain the gyro axis vertical. During an acceleration, the force acts to disturb both the pendulous unit and the vanes, and this results in a false right climb indication.",

Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument.

The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

            "explanation": "REMOTE-READING COMPASS SYSTEM A remote-reading compass system consists of a directional gyroscope and flux valve. The main direction indication of the system comes from a directional gyroscope, which is kept from drifting by tying it to the output of a flux valve unit for magnetic reference. This happens when “slave” is selected on the “free/slave” switch. Alternative Explanation: The Gyro-Magnetic Compass (GMC) system has two operational modes: \"SLAVE\" mode: used when magnetic heading references are reliable. It is the normal magnetically-monitored mode. In this mode, the directional gyro is connected to the magnetic flux detector, which provides a stable magnetic reference to counteract the gyro's apparent drift. \"FREE\" mode (Directional gyro): used when magnetic heading references are not reliable, such as in polar regions. In this mode, the system supplies an inertial heading reference, and the pilot manually introduces corrections to compensate for earth rate and other errors. If the switch is changed to \"FREE\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized.

It has only one gimbal, providing the turn indicator’s rate gyro only one degree of freedom. This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument. A reverse gearing system transmits the movement of the gimbal to a pointer which indicates the rate of turn over a rate of turn calibrated scale. The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system.

Gyros are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. Despite the property of rigidity, the orientation of a gyro axis may alter over time. Any departure of a gyro axis from its original orientation is called wander. Wander may be either real or apparent (the difference is explained below) or a combination of both. Wander is subdivided into drift and topple. If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. (figure 1) If the gyro axis wanders in the vertical plane, it is called topple, either real or apparent.

If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

Gravity erection is essential for the operation of an artificial horizon. However, accelerations occur during flight which cannot be distinguished from gravitational accelerations, induce indication errors. The erection system therefore tries to align the gyro axis with the apparent vertical. During acceleration, the erection system is unable to distinguish between acceleration caused by gravity (in the direction of the local vertical) and the inertia of its sensor. As a result, the apparent vertical is inclined to the rear (spin axis is displaced from the vertical) and causes a higher pitch indication. In simple words, the horizon bar moves down, indicating a climb. Deceleration causes the apparent vertical to tilt forwards, reducing the perceived pitch attitude.",

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

            "explanation": "The artificial horizon gives the pilot an indication of the aircraft’s attitude in pitch and roll. It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes. Additionally, some more sophisticated artificial horizons are electrically driven and maintain the rotor’s axis vertical by using two mercury level switches and two torque motors.",

This implies that the angle of bank should be correct for the TAS and rate of turn. The slip indicator gives a direct indication of the state of balance of the turn. This comprises a solid ball in a curved tube containing liquid with damps out the unwanted oscillations. The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube acting as the effective point of suspension. Operating Principles Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W (figure 1). The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of curvature of the tube. If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines etched on the tube. Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left (figure 2). The aircraft with lift L equal and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being proportional to TAS and rate of turn. The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal force C.",

APPARENT WANDER In this type of wander, the gyro spin axis does not physically wander away from its pre-set direction, but to an observer it appears to have changed its direction. This is because the gyro maintains its direction with respect to a fixed point in space, whereas the observer rotates with the Earth, thus with the passage of time the gyro appears to have changed direction, with reference to an Earth datum. Apparent wander, is also made up of horizontal components called drift, and vertical components called topple. The rate of drift and topple depends upon the latitude and can vary from zero to a maximum of 15.04° per hour (the rate at which the Earth rotates).",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, for example, during a take-off run, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement.",

TAS exhibits an inverse relationship with the rate of turn, but it is directly proportional to the radius of the turn due to the increase in inertia and momentum of the aircraft with an increase in TAS. You can quickly compute the necessary bank angle for a standard 3° per second turn using the formula: Angle of bank = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7 For instance, for TAS values of 100 knots and 150 knots: Angle of bank for 100 knots = (100 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 17° Angle of bank for 150 knots = (150 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 22° This comparison reveals that as speed increases, so does the required bank angle to maintain the standard rate of turn, indicating a proportional relationship with TAS.",

Gyros have its mass evenly distributed around its spin axis and are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. In order for a gyro to be able to maintain a fixed direction, it must be attached to the airframe in such a way that the aircraft has freedom to manoeuvre without disturbing the orientation of the gyro.

The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous vanes at the base of the rotor housing, so that when the rotor axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane. Because the four jets are of equal strength but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - the gyro rotor remaining vertical. The opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as two pairs. The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted airflow, while the opposite slot is completely obstructed by its vane. The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. ACCELERATION ERROR (figure 2) The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose- up, right wing down, or climbing right hand turn indication will result. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot. This results in a reaction which acts to port. By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction of application of the Reaction had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise). The gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the pilot. This movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication. Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during acceleration. This force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical. This rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing down indication.",

Gyroscope - A gyroscope provides an AHRS with a measurement of the aircraft's angular rate. Each angular rate is integrated to determine the aircraft's attitude. Accelerometer - An accelerometer supplies an AHRS with a measure of the aircraft's acceleration and is assumed to be measuring gravity alone. This assumption allows the accelerometer to calculate the pitch and roll angles from the direction of the gravity vector. Magnetometer - Since the accelerometer can only measure pitch & roll, a magnetometer provides an AHRS with a measurement of yaw by comparing the measurement of the magnetic field surrounding the aircraft to Earth's magnetic field, just like a traditional magnetic compass.",

INSs can be considered to be stand-alone, whereas IRSs are integrated with the FMS. The wording of these options seems to be almost intentionally difficult to understand. To start, we need to realise that EASA are referring to a stabilised platform INS when they call something an inertial navigation system, as per the above learning objective. These are systems that, once aligned, have a platform that remains level and pointing towards the North, which is controlled by rate-integrating gyros and servo motors to keep the platform in that orientation. By inputting the initial location when the INS is aligned and kept still, the system can then track every acceleration in the North/South and East/West axis to keep a track of speed and therefore distance travelled along those axes. Therefore, there is still a reference for this system, the North direction and which way is up. The platform then endeavours to maintain these references during flight. More modern systems using the same idea are called strapdown IRSs. They are much smaller and cheaper, and are fixed to the aircraft structure, measuring the accelerations and rotations of the aircraft and applying them in a computer model of the Earth to provide an improved version of an INS.",
