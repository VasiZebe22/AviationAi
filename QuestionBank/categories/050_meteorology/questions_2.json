Radiative cooling is commonly experienced on cloudless nights, when heat radiated from the earth surface freely escapes into space, resulting in colder temperatures. If clouds are present, some of the heat emitted from the earth's surface is trapped by the clouds and reemitted back towards the earth. As a result, temperatures decrease more slowly than if the skies were clear. During the day, the earth is heated by the sun. If skies are clear, more heat reaches the earth's surface. This leads to warmer temperatures. However, if skies are cloudy, some of the sun's rays are reflected off the cloud droplets back into space. Therefore, less of the sun's energy is able to reach the earth's surface, which causes the earth to heat up more slowly. This leads to cooler temperatures.",

Because of this the QFE will be measured 50 feet below sea level, the QNH will still be measured at sea level which is 50 feet higher.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet).

The tropopause height varies with latitude and season - and it is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. - The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause.

The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C. Calculating the average tropopause height (ft): Tropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280 for winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result. Latitude is given by the question: 60ºN Tropopause height = (16 x cos 60º) x 3280 = 26 240 ft Overhead the sea, it is usually warmer. Therefore, we would have to choose the next higher value. From available options, 20 000 ft would be too low. Best option: 29 000 ft. Note: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value.

First, we need to determine the temperature correction. Given an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 500/1000) = -270 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude.

Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa) and altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels. Pressure decreases with increasing height.

In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 977 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1012 hPa - 977 hPa = 35 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 35 hPa x 27 ft = 945 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 6500 ft - 945 ft = 5555 ft The elevation at B is 930 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 5555 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 5555 ft - 930 ft = 4625 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 977 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 930 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1012 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 930 ft + 945 ft = 1875 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 6500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1012). We need to climb 6500 ft - 1875 ft = 4625 ft (which is our height over the surface).

Conduction involves the transfer of heat through molecular contact and influences the temperature of the air directly in contact with the Earth's surface. However, its impact diminishes with altitude due to air's poor conductivity. Convection occurs as the surface heats the air above, causing it to rise due to decreased density. This vertical movement is a key mechanism for transferring heat upwards, leading to cloud formation and further warming through latent heat release. Turbulent mixing aids in horizontal air mass movement and heat distribution within the atmosphere, but its role in vertical heat transfer is less significant compared to convection. Radiation is crucial, with the Earth's surface absorbing solar radiation and emitting it as longwave radiation, warming the air above. In summary, convection and radiation are the dominant processes that transfer heat from the Earth's surface to the higher levels of the troposphere. While conduction's impact is limited vertically, and turbulent mixing primarily affects horizontal heat transfer. Therefore, conduction and turbulence predominantly contribute to heat transfer to the lower levels of the atmosphere.",

To remember which way the pressure setting change is applied, remember that increasing the pressure setting in the subscale increases the altitude indicated on the altimeter. An increase of one causes an increase in the other. Now let's work it out. (1) First determine the difference in ft between actual elevation and standby altimeter indication: 254 ft – 173 ft = 81 ft (2) Determine the difference in hPa, assuming a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa (use 30 ft/hPa if it has not been specified in the question): 81 ft / 27 ft/hPa = 3 hPa (3) Since we want the altimeter to have a higher indication (254 ft instead of 173 ft), the altimeter setting must increase for the actual elevation to be shown: 1018 hPa + 3 hPa = 1021 hPa",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 000/1000) = -240 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­3 760 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "• True altitude is the vertical distance of the aircraft above sea level, specifically above mean sea level. • Indicated altitude is the barometric altitude displayed by the altimeter, which shows the aircraft's height above mean sea level. Adjusting the altimeter's sub-scale setting changes the altitude reading. Decreasing the sub-scale value (setting a lower pressure) will cause the altimeter to show a lower altitude. This happens because a lower pressure setting moves the reference level closer to your vertical position, and vice versa. For example, changing the sub-scale setting from 1030 hPa to 1010 hPa will lower the altimeter reading, as the distance between the aircraft and the 1010 hPa pressure level is less than the distance to the 1030 hPa level. When flying from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the actual altitude decreases while the indicated altitude remains the same. This discrepancy causes the altimeter to over-read the aircraft's true altitude. Flying from high pressure to low pressure: actual altitude < indicated altitude (QNH) Flying from low pressure to high pressure: actual altitude > indicated altitude (QNH) With the altimeter set to a QNH of 1030 hPa, if the indicated altitude is 8500 ft, but the local QNH is actually 1010 hPa (20 hPa lower), maintaining a QNH of 1030 hPa would mean the true altitude (based on a QNH of 1010 hPA) of the aircraft is lower than the indicated altitude by: 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft Therefore, ⇒ True altitude = 8 500 ft - 600 ft = 7 900 ft",

If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated.

If the aircraft is drifting to the left, it means that a Right Crosswind is being experienced (Wind is blowing from the right to the left). => If we imagine ourselves standing with our back into the wind, we will now have the low-pressure area to our right (where we are flying to) and the high-pressure area on our left (where we are flying from). Therefore, we will be flying towards a Lower-pressure area and because of that the altimeter will Over read. The aircrafts true altitude will be decreasing flying to the lower-pressure area.",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. When we move from south to north in the Northern Hemisphere we move from the equator to the poles. The temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the height of the tropopause decrease.",

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

To solve this question, all we need to do is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­594 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 3 600 ft - 594 = 3 006 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (15 000/1 000) = -900 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­15 900 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 900 ft + 300 ft = 16 200 ft. RULES.

To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the left, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from high pressure to low pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually decrease. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the left, the aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

            "explanation": "The aircraft must fly at 6500 ft. This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation, to get the indicated altitude (with local QNH set). To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15°C, and the temperature lapse rate is -2°C/1000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15°C - (6500/1000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2°C. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-9°C, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -11°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-11) × (6500/1000) = -286 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­6786 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 979 hPa = 34 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 34 ft x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 020 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 020 ft = 3 980 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -21.8ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -21.8ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 980 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 380 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-21.8) × (2 380/1000) = -207 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 773 ft.

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude of 36 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-2ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -17ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 5 860 ft - 36 ft = 5 824 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (5 824/1000) = -396 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­6 256 ft.

This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 256 ft + 1 230 ft = 7 486 ft.

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (8 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft.

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+13) × (8 000/1000) = 416 ft.

The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore, pressure correction is disregarded. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL390). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at FL390 is -56.5ºC (since it is below ISA tropopause). The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-48 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +8.5ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8.5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (8.5) × (34 000/1000) = 1 156 ft.

Coriolis force will be decreased, the PGF is now more dominant. This causes a change in wind direction - blows across the isobars towards the low pressure. As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic. In the Northern Hemisphere, the wind will back and slackens off as you descend to the surface due to the friction effect. In other words, in the Northern hemisphere, frictional retardation causes veering of the airflow during climb out through the lower boundary layer (2000-3000 ft). In the Southern Hemisphere, the wind veers and slackens off as you descend to the surface. In other words, in the southern hemisphere, frictional retardation causes backing of the flow with height in the lower boundary layer.",

Mountain waves are very violent updrafts and downdrafts that occcur above, and downstream of, mountain ranges. In particular, the area insde and underneath a lenticular cloud contains extremely violent rotor turbulence effects, and should never be flown close to. When at only 1 500 ft above the maximum terrain elevation, the downdrafts from these mountain waves could easily overpower a piston aircraft's maximum rate of climb, causing potential terrain clearance issues also. Another problem with mountain waves is that they can, in the right conditions, continue upwards for tens of thousands of feet, up as high as the tropopause in some cases. This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case. Sometimes the lenticular clouds will form in higher mountain wave layers, stacking up; sometimes they will not. If there are lenticular clouds around 9500ft, there will almost certainly be a lot of turbulence around 11,500ft also. If you were to go a few more miles East, you would be out of the mountain range area. This is not an excessive diversion to make, and so could be completed safely. If this was not possible, then turning back would be the best course of action.",

The relationship between isobar spacing and pressure gradient is that the closer the isobar spacing (strong/steep pressure gradient), the stronger the pressure gradient, thus the stronger the wind. The spacing between isobars represents a pressure differential between those two isobars. When two isobars are closer together, the pressure changes at a greater rate over distance. When isobars are spaced far apart (weak/shallow pressure gradient), the pressure changes more gradually over distance and thus the wind speed is weaker. Therefore, we can conclude that surface winds with isobars closed together – result in strong winds blowing across the isobars at an angle, towards the LOW.",

To conclude, on the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. Initially, the air warms at the SALR, since some moisture will be lost on the windward side, the warming of the descending air at SALR will be shorter - the air becomes unsaturated at a lower temperature (higher altitude) than the original dew point. Thus, the cloud base on the leeward side will be higher than the cloud base on the windward side which is at 2 000 ft.",

Southern Hemisphere is the other way around: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. In the case of this specific question: The question states we are flying in the Northern Hemisphere. Cross wind from the right means that the wind is blowing from the right to the left. If we imagine ourselves standing with our back into the wind, we will now have the low-pressure area to our left (where we came from) and the high-pressure area on our right (where we are flying to). So, we will be flying to a higher-pressure area and because of that the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be increasing flying to the higher-pressure area.",

In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind. => Therefore, in the Northern Hemisphere, wind backs with decreasing altitude (meaning that winds will veer as we climb through the friction layer). Once out of the friction layer, winds should stop veering and should start blowing parallel to isobars. However, the question states that a warm front is approaching and at the warm front, the wind sharply veers => which means that the winds above the friction layer will continue to veer.",

Free cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside. An anabatic wind is a light wind of around 5 kt. A katabatic wind is caused by a ﬂow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night, when the highlands radiate heat and are cooled. The air in contact with the higher-level ground is also cooled, and it becomes denser than the air at the same elevation but away from the slope; it, therefore, begins to flow downhill. The katabatic eﬀect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the ﬂow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form.",

This is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense, from approximately 280° to approximately 230°.

Free cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside. An anabatic wind is a light wind of around 5 kt. A katabatic wind is caused by a ﬂow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night, when the highlands radiate heat and are cooled. The air in contact with the higher-level ground is also cooled, and it becomes denser than the air at the same elevation but away from the slope; it, therefore, begins to flow downhill. The katabatic eﬀect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the ﬂow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form.",

            "explanation": "Some information is missing in this question. We lack clarity on whether this scenario unfolds in the Southern or Northern Hemisphere, which means that we do not know whether the wind backs or veers. However, we do know it's over the sea, indicating a speed reduction of 70%. Given a \"2000 ft wind\" of 80 knots, we can anticipate the surface wind to be 56 kt. Furthermore, the direction is expected to be 10° different. As mentioned above, we do not know the hemisphere, therefore we are unable to determine the exact wind direction. Closest option: 330° / 65 kt Further information: The geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the free stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind). Surface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also changed in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force. This means that in the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is \"backed\" from the free stream wind, to go towards the low pressure (and it is \"veered\" in the Southern Hemisphere). The degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on the surface type (its friction) and the time of day (amount of vertical mixing): Day Night Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Land 30° 50% 40° 30% Sea 10° 70% 10° 70%",

The most severe turbulence can occur in the rotor zone lying beneath the crests of lee waves and is often marked by roll clouds. The most powerful rotor lies beneath the first wave crest (one wavelength downwind). Flight in waves can be smooth, but severe turbulence may occur. Occasionally violent turbulence will occur, due to wave ‘breaking’. The resultant waves can extend for hundreds of miles downwind of the range, if suitable conditions prevail. If sufficient moisture is available in the atmosphere, Rotor/Roll clouds can be observed, indicating the presence of a rotor phenomenon - which occurs at the same height or under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge.",

The extent of the friction layer increases as the amount of solar radiation increases. During the day, the surface of the Earth heats up because of solar radiation. In warmer air, the vertical movement of the air parcels intensifies. This means that the warm air mixes in a thicker layer than in colder air. Due to the intensive mixing processes, convective turbulence can often be expected on warm days. At night, the extent of the friction layer decreases as the surface of the Earth cools. Consequently, the intensity of the convection and the surface wind decreases Its minimum value is to be observed around sunrise. Note: Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 h on clear sunny days (when the highest temperatures are reached) - In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.",

The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

Both airborne weather radar and ground weather radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot, but not for CAT, as there are no such visible particles to give returns. Satellites are very similar, they cannot detect it as it is effectively invisible to their sensors. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft (EASA like to ask questions about this), as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is quite a lot of educated guesswork, giving very wide areas of possible CAT, and it can also appear in unexpected places with no warning.",

If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. In the case of this specific question: The question states that we are flying in the Northern Hemisphere, so if we stand with our back into the wind, the low-pressure area is on our left-hand side. Since we have a wind from the left, (and we imagine ourselves standing with our back into the wind, so with our face pointing east) we must be flying from a high to a low-pressure area. If the pressure in an area changes, we have to think about what consequence this has on our flight. Since we fly on a Flight level (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But our actual flight level will. Because the altimeter is only accurate in the Standard Atmosphere and we now are experiencing a lower actual pressure, the altimeter will over read.

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Whilst the wind is relatively smooth in general, there is a significant amount of windshear, causing heavy turbulence and rotor effects underneath the peaks of the wave. Mountain waves are not just at the height of the mountain peaks though, as they affect the air above themselves also, and, given the right conditions, can propagate as high as the tropopause. Lenticular clouds indicate the presence of mountain waves, and even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near, due to the effects mentioned above. That being said, not all mountain waves have lenticular clouds, so it is important to be careful of them when downwind of any mountain range with the correct conditions.",

            "explanation": "A synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area. Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force. The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. This makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more. The outflow of air from a high is called divergence. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days. The inflow of air into a low is called convergence. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather. In this question, they are asking about the atmospheric divergence from a high pressure zone. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel across the isobars and away from the high pressure area, towards the low.",

We cannot assume the examiner will be nice, and unfortunately we must assume that there will be extra confusion caused where possible. Learning Objective 050.02.02.01.05: Indicate how the geostrophic wind flows in relation to the isobars/isohypses in the northern and in the southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the cold front about halfway through the route, this is a change in direction in the clockwise sense (known as \"veering\"), from approximately 230° (SW) to approximately 280°(NW). The isobars are also closer together before we reach the cold front, meaning that the wind speed is higher in this region (the warm sector), and therefore the wind speed decreases after passing through the cold front. The cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front). This means that we are travelling directly opposite to it, starting in the warm sector ahead of the front, and passing through into the cold sector behind it.",

This can leads to strong turbulence effects from mountain rotors and strong downdrafts on the lee-side of the mountain. Therefore, in stable conditions, the most turbulence will be found when downwind of a mountain or mountain range. In strong enough winds, stable air conditions can lead to mountain waves forming downwind of the mountain/mountain range which triggers them, and they are incredibly turbulent areas, with significant updrafts and downdrafts. In this case, the wind direction for the airport to be downwind of the mountain is from anywhere between about 040º and 100º, as the contour chart appears to show a bit of a mountain ridge line.

Precipitation will occur and removes moisture, lowering the dew point. As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms more than it cooled on the windward side. This leads to higher cloud bases and clear, turbulent conditions. The result is a warm, dry wind on the downside of the mountain, with temperature increases of over 10°C possible. Föhn winds may indicate the presence of mountain waves. In such conditions, the most severe turbulence often occurs in the rotor zone beneath the crests of lee waves, often indicated by roll clouds. The strongest rotor typically lies beneath the first wave crest, positioned one wavelength downwind. While flying in these waves can be smooth, there's a risk of encountering severe turbulence.",

According to Ballot’s Law, in the Northern Hemisphere, if one stands with one's back to the wind the atmospheric pressure will be lower on one's left. – Meaning that the LOW will be left of the arrow, therefore you’ll be flying towards it. Conclusion: When experiencing a crosswind from the left, you will be flying towards a LOW and a HIGH will be behind. Keep in mind the general wind circulation: Northern Hemisphere; around a LOW it is anti-clockwise and around a HIGH it is clockwise.

Clear air turbulence (CAT) refers to turbulence occurring in cloud-free air. Unlike convective turbulence, CAT is invisible and may lack obvious signs of its presence. Consequently, the associated turbulence can catch individuals off guard. CAT can be severe, leading to structural damage, physical harm to both crew and passengers, and even impairing crew performance to the extent that simple tasks like reading instruments become nearly impossible. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft, as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. It is crucial for pilots to report turbulence so that air traffic control (ATC) can issue advisories to other aircraft and provide requested information. Aircraft reports (AIREPs) are particularly valuable since they can indicate the presence of CAT if turbulence is reported by another aircraft flying along the same route. This information assists in determining the potential location of CAT.",

Mountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere. Mountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following atmospheric conditions are present: Wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band. Wind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height. A marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below If the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence. Provided there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds are formed with mountain waves and these provide useful warning of the presence of such waves. The clouds are: Lenticular, or lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found up to, and possibly above, the tropopause. Rotor, or roll-clouds occur under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind and will be level or slightly above the ridge crest. Cap clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes. Mountain Waves are associated with severe turbulence, strong vertical currents, and icing.",

Day: Direction Speed Land -30° x 0,5 Sea -15° x 0,7 Night: Direction Speed Land -40° x 0,3 Sea -15° x 0,7 So, the surface wind backs in direction and lowers in speed compared to the free air gradient wind. In the Southern Hemisphere, the surface wind veers (clockwise turn) in direction compared with the free air gradient wind (opposite to NH, speed also reduces the same). In case of this specific question: We are in the NH near the ground and have a wind blowing from 080 at 10 knots. Looking at the above we know the surface wind backs (anti-clockwise turn) in direction and decrease in strength. So, if we go up in altitude, we can expect the wind to veer about 30 degrees and the speed to double. Answer is 110/20KT.",

The most generalized explanation of wind shear is “a change in wind speed and/or direction in space, including updrafts and downdrafts”. Wind shear is always present in the atmosphere and its presence is often visible to an observer. Examples are cloud layers at different levels moving in different directions; smoke plumes sheared and moving in different directions at different heights; rotating suspended debris and/or water droplets in the relatively innocuous dust devils and in the extremely dangerous water spouts and tornadoes; the “wall-like” leading edge of dust/sandstorms; and trees bending in all directions in response to sudden gusts from a squall line. All these visual effects testify to the universal presence of wind shear and wind shear-causing phenomena in the atmosphere. (ICAO Doc 9817 Manual on Low-level Wind Shear, Chapter 1)",

These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance. The Gradient wind occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow. Note that we are comparing the gradient wind in a LOW/HIGH to the equivalent Geostrophic wind and not the gradient wind around a HIGH to the gradient wind around a LOW.",

As the movement begins, the Coriolis force CF begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces). Geostrophic wind: Occurs above the friction layer. Occurs at a latitude greater than 15 degrees. Occurs when the isobars are straight, parallel and equidistant (constant gradient). Occurs when the pressure situation is not changing rapidly (constant gradient/equidistant).",

Low-level atmospheric divergence means that there is a net flow of air outwards from a location (the air is diverging) at the surface level. This occurs due to a surface high pressure region (anticyclone). This excess air that flows outwards must come from somewhere though, and it arrives from above, flowing down into the high pressure region in a process called subsidence. This subsidence causes clear weather conditions, as no air is rising (which would form clouds), instead all the air is sinking, and warming at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate). This makes the sinking air quite warm when it gets close to the ground, and often a high pressure inversion will form, with haze trapped underneath. The further we go back in the process, though, we can see that the air above the surface high pressure region must feed it with that air somehow, and that comes from air flowing inwards at the top of the troposphere (just under the tropopause), which is called things like \"convergence aloft\", \"high altitude convergence\", etc., they all mean the same thing. Effectively, there is a low pressure region at high altitude which takes in the air to feed the high pressure region at low altitude.",

The jet stream is a fast moving \"ribbon\" of air in the upper troposphere, that occurs because of a large change in temperature between two air masses. Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because the tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes), due primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the Coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together, flowing from West to East. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall. All Jet streams flow from West to East (except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream). In the Northern Hemisphere, that is because the tropopause South of the jet stream is higher than the tropopause to the North. It is important to note that the boxed numbers (\"F300\", \"F370\", etc.) are the indications of the pressure altitude of the tropopause in flight levels. This notation is used in high altitude charts such as sig wx charts.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.02.05.01.05: Describe that mountain wave effects can exceed the performance or structural capability of aircraft. Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Whilst the wind is relatively smooth in general, there is a significant amount of windshear, causing heavy turbulence and rotor effects underneath the peaks of the wave. Mountain waves are not just at the height of the mountain peaks though, as they affect the air above themselves also, and, given the right conditions, can propagate as high as the tropopause. Lenticular clouds indicate the presence of mountain waves, and even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near, due to the effects mentioned above. That being said, not all mountain waves have lenticular clouds, so it is important to be careful of them when downwind of any mountain range with the correct conditions.",

Polar Front Jet Core altitude approx. 30 000 – 35 000ft, we are therefore flying above the core (FL400) JET STREAMS occur as a result of strong temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. Look at the example of the POLAR FRONT JET (SH): North of front – warm air mass => wider isobar spacing (tropical airmass). South of front – cold air mass => closer isobar spacing (Polar airmass). Tropical air mass tropopause – situated at a higher altitude and its temperature is lower, compared to the polar air tropopause. Polar air mass tropopause – situated at a lower altitude and its temperature is higher, compared to the tropical air tropopause. => Above the cold sector tropopause the temperature remains constant. But on the warm sector, temperatures will continue to decrease until the tropopause is reached. Which means that above the jet core, temperatures are colder in the warm sector. Therefore, we can say that flying from the south to the north (Cold sector to Warm sector SH) above the core, the temperature will decrease. Note: Core of the jet stream is located in the warm air – above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause.",

Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed, this reduction will reduce the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE. This wind is called surface wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (figure b. on the attachment).",

These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance. The Gradient wind occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow.

In the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the front, this is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense (known as \"backing\"), from approximately 280° (NW) to approximately 230°(SW). The isobars are also closer together after the second cold front, meaning that the wind speed is higher in this region, and therefore the wind gets faster after passing through the cold front. The cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front. This means that \"in front\" of the cold front is the Eastern side of it, and \"behind\" the cold front is the Western side. Our track means that we \"overtake\" the front, starting behind it and passing through it to end up in front of it. Note: this is a variation on question 507036 which has been fed back to us.

            "explanation": "SURFACE WIND The geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the free stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind). We sometimes call this free stream flow the \"2000 ft wind\" because the boundary layer of the surface friction has usually ended by that height, so the \"2000 ft wind\" is usually unaffected by the surface friction. Surface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also changed in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force. This means that the surface wind will be more affected by the pressure gradient force (PGF) than the coriolis force (CF), so will flow towards the low pressure somewhat. This means that in the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is \"backed\" from the free stream wind, to go towards the low pressure (and it is \"veered\" in the Southern Hemisphere). The degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on the surface type (its friction) and the time of day (amount of vertical mixing). Day Night Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Land 30° 50% 40° 30% Sea 10° 70% 10° 70% So in Brussels during the day, the surface wind (9 kt) can be expected to be 50% of the \"2000 ft wind\". Therefore, the \"2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be approximately 18 kt. Furthermore, the direction is expected to be 30º different. As mentioned above, the surface wind is backed by this amount in the Northern Hemisphere, which means that the \"2000 ft\" wind is veered by 30º from the surface wind. Veering is an increase in the direction number, and backing is a decrease. Therefore, the \"2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be coming from approximately 250 + 30 = 280° The correct answer is 280°/18 kt",

            "explanation": "Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air decends back to the surface. The difference between these updrafts and downdrafts can cause windshear, with strong changes of speed and direction over a short distance. These strong winds also interact with the uneven terrain and with other nearby winds to cause significant turbulence for any overflying aircraft. To take a look at the other possible answers: Mountain waves can produce strong downdrafts which exceed the climb capability of some smaller aircraft, but not usually turbojet engined aircraft, as they climb far faster than smaller piston powered aircraft. There are not many smooth conditions when strong winds are present, and mountains only make the bumpiness worse. Usually the turbulence caused by mountains will subside with height above the mountain, only very occasionally does severe turbulence extend as high as the tropopause.",

Widely spaced isobars also imply a small pressure gradient force and since the pressure gradient force is small, we can expect light or calm wind. In this context the development of local wind systems is likely to occur: > Land and Sea Breezes > Katabatic and Anabatic winds Sea breezes On a sunny day, particularly in an anticyclone with a light PGF, the land will heat quickly. The air in contact will be warmed and will rise and expand so that pressure at about 1000 ft will be higher than pressure at the same level over the sea. This will cause a drift of air from over the land to over the sea at about 1000 ft. The drift of air will cause the surface pressure over the land to fall, and the surface pressure over the sea to rise. As a result there will be a flow of air from sea to land. On average, sea breezes extend 8 to 14 NM either side of the coast and the speed is about 10 kt. In the tropics speed is 15 kt or more and the inland extent is greater. The direction of the sea breeze is more or less at right angles to the coast, but after some time it will veer under the influence of the Coriolis Force. Land breezes From mid-afternoon the land is starting to cool and this process will accelerate after sunset. Overnight the situation will reverse and pressure will now be higher on land than over the sea as the temperature reduces. This will give rise to a wind now blowing from land to sea. The land breeze can be expected within about 5 NM of the coastline and with a maximum speed of about 5 kt. Katabatic wind A katabatic wind or mountain wind is caused by a flow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night. If the side of the mountain is cooled, the air in contact is also cooled: it will thus be denser and heavier than the surrounding air and it will therefore flow down the mountain side. The katabatic effect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the flow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form. Another effect is that with the sinking of cold air down the slope, the air at higher levels will be warmer and an inversion results. Anabatic wind An anabatic wind or valley wind is a light wind of around 5 kt which blows up a hill or mountain by day. On a warm sunny day, the slope of a hill will become heated by insolation, particularly if it is a south facing slope. The air in contact with the ground will be heated by conduction and will rise up the hill. Free cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside.",

In case of this specific question: We are in the NH near the ground and have a wind blowing from 190 at 15 knots.

This means the wind is coming from the direction of the sea, which would be from the left side of the aircraft during final approach and landing. Further information: Sea breezes are most likely to occur on a sunny day, especially when an anticyclone with a gentle pressure gradient force (PGF) dominates the area, leading to rapid heating of the land. As the air in contact warms up, it expands and rises, creating higher pressure at approximately 1 000 feet above the land compared to the same level over the sea. This pressure difference prompts air to flow from over the land to over the sea at around 1 000 feet altitude. Consequently, surface pressure over the land decreases while surface pressure over the sea increases. This atmospheric setup results in a movement of air from the sea toward the land, known as a sea breeze. Note: The land-breeze blows during the night and is weaker than the sea-breeze.",

Convergence occurs when winds from different directions meet and come together in a specific region. This process results in the accumulation of air mass in that area. Because more air is being transported into the region than is being moved out, the air pressure increases and the excess air has to go somewhere. This excess air is forced to rise, leading to vertical movement. As the air rises, it cools and can lead to cloud formation and potentially precipitation.",

This model was not quite correct because in our temperate latitudes pressure is predominantly low because of the large scale frontal depressions. An American scientist, William Ferrel, proposed a modification to Hadley’s model introducing the modification arising because of the low pressure systems in temperate latitudes. This gives the three circulation cells: the Hadley cell between the Equator and the subtropics; the Ferrel cell between the subtropics and temperate latitudes; the Polar cell between temperate latitudes and the poles. This circulation means that we have, at the tropopause, air flowing outwards from the Equator towards the poles and from temperate latitudes towards the Equator. This creates an excess of air at the tropopause in subtropical regions which is forced to descend, hence creating the subtropical high pressure systems which are permanent features over the subtropical oceans (e.g. the Azores high in the North Atlantic).",

            "explanation": "LOW LEVEL JET STREAMS A nocturnal low-level jet is a fast-moving air current in the lower atmosphere during night time when the skies are clear. As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night. A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion. The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet The other options here are either incorrect or made up by the examiner. The polar night jet is another term for the arctic jetstream as far as we can tell. It happens around 20 000 ft around the poles during their winter, when they get extremely cold due to the polar night. A low-level sting jet is a mostly made up term. Sting jets are a thing to do with weather forecasting and can form very powerful storms but these jets are at high level, not formed in this way, and are way off the ATPL syllabus. A squall line jet is not a thing. Squall lines are line of thunderstorms, so certainly not the case in this scenario.",

Aircraft flying close to a Jet Stream may encounter Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear. CAT occurs around the core of the jet stream, which is in the warm air sector. The CAT is strongest on the cold/polar/low pressure side of the jet stream core (the North side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream. Approx. at the cold air tropopause level (below the warm air tropopause level). Another area of strong shear is situated at the border of the upper level front. These areas are identified by red arrow on the attached figures. Note: Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotachs. Note: Core of the jet stream is located in the warm air – above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause. As can be seen in the first annex above, the highest CAT does exist at and above the tropopause near the core, as well as in the region of the front. Therefore, it can be best avoided under the tropopause (but depending on the scenario, this is quite debatable).",

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

The equatorial jet stream forms due to the ITCZ going far North during the Northern Hemisphere summer months. The high level outflow from the ITCZ turns right as it flows away (North Hemisphere Coriolis), so the wind that flowed outwards, South towards the equator, turns right and builds up enough speed to flow East to West in the region of the equator above 80 kts, and is considered a jet stream. It therefore only forms in the areas where there is significant land North of the Equator, and much less land South of the Equator.

            "explanation": "After reading this question, the first thing that pops in my mind is a Valley Inversion - due to the location of the airfield (basin within mountainous area) and the presence of a High Pressure system. To simplify this question, let's break it down in two parts: \"in the early morning\" and \"engines of the aircraft will deliver more thrust after breaking through the inversion layer if the pilot does not intervene.\" explained: A Valley Inversion forms as a result of both cooling of the ground during a clear night (typical High Pressure weather conditions.) due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds. The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is formed. => Since inversions occur most often during the night, its effects will be more marked in the early morning. Moreover, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we descend through an inversion, temperature decreases with a decrease in height => we will experience an increased aircraft performance, leading to an increase in thrust and lift, as we dense into colder and denser air. \"after a short period of bumpiness\" explained: Temperature Inversions are associated with potential windshear at the top of the inversion. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion and turbulence.",

Clear air turbulence is a remarkably difficult to detect as a pilot (until you are within it), as no radar returns will ever show it. Both airborne weather radar and ground radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot. Unfortunately, this does nothing to help us detect clear air turbulence (CAT), as, by definition, there are no particles to receive returns from, so RADARs will not pick it up. This is the same for satellite sensors, which also would not be able to pick up this invisible phenomenon. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft, as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is very much guesswork, and CAT can appear in unexpected places with no warning. It would certainly be difficult to pick up with a weather balloon, as CAT areas are isolated and the chance of the weather balloon ascending through one is small.",

The image depicted in the annex given is of a cold front \"chasing\" a warm front, which is most often seen as part of a polar front depression (often called a travelling low). This is an unstable low pressure zone that forms along the polar front and travels from West to East. As the polar front is the border between the cold polar air and warmer sub-tropical air, which is called a front, this depression twists the front into two separate fronts, a warm front, and a cold front \"chasing\" it. The jetstream is a wide band of fast flowing air that sits in the warm air section of this interaction at high altitude, with the wind generally going from West to East (but it is very rarely straight, it often bends and snakes around pressure patterns). Due to the slant of the front (warm air sits over cold), the jetstream is within the warm sector, but is actually overhanging the cold sector, so looks like it is inside the cold air when viewed from above (as we often mark the front locations due to their surface positions, but this is different from their positions up near the tropopause). As the weather fronts are bent by the depression, so is the polar front in general, as is the jetstream which follows this polar front. The jetstream therefore sits in front of the warm front and behind the cold front due to the slant, meaning that the point on this diagram where the jetstream is westerly is Point C (The jetstream is usually wider than in the annex above). The jetstream also sits much further in front of the warm front than it does behind the cold front due to the different slant ratios of warm and cold fronts, warm fronts have shallower gradients, so go on for many more miles before reaching the tropopause where the front ends.",

Learning Objective 050.02.06.02.02: State where turbulence will normally be found (rough-ground surfaces, relief, inversion layers, cumulonimbus (CB), thunderstorm (TS) zones, unstable layers). Turbulence is caused by violent or unsteady movement of air, and describes the effect of the aircraft being jolted around in flight, often unpredictably, putting increased strain on the airframe and decreasing passenger comfort. It can be caused by vertical movement of air \"pockets\", through either convective or mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called windshear. Convective turbulence occurs due to either instability in the air causing vertical air movement (cumulus type clouds show this effect) or by thermal heating of the ground. The Earth's surface is made up of different materials, and these absorb and radiate heat energy at different rates, that means that an airport (lots of tarmac or concrete) may create a much warmer pocket of air than a grassy meadow, for instance, and this will cause a significant difference in air movement between the two. Mechanical turbulence is caused due to undulations and objects on the Earth's surface. Buildings, trees, hills and mountains can change the pattern of the wind, and cause eddy currents of wind in the air close to the ground. This can cause a lot of turbulence at lower levels, such as after take-off or on the approach. Orographic turbulence is another name for this, but is more specific to the turbulence caused by hills, mountains, etc. The time of worst turbulence during the day is usually early to mid-afternoon, where the ground is radiating the most heat, and therefore the pockets of air are at their most different to each other, causing the most turbulence. Higher winds also contribute to more mechanical turbulence, especially when the terrain is rough and there are plenty of obstacles for the wind to hit.",

The marked temperature difference between the warm and cold air causes a pressure differential, which causes a wind up to around 70 kts in the warm air section, which sits over the cold air that is moving in. These are common in the central United States and the plains of Southern Germany, amongst other places, and are not technically a jet stream according to the World Meteorological Organisation's definition. They occur in a similar fashion to a jet stream, though, hence the name. Note: Technically, the low-level nocturnal jetstream exists above the inversion, however, the answer (from feedback) may still be somewhat correct, as the question does not make it clear what is meant by the \"top of the inversion\". As we would usually see this from a side-on view, we know that the low-level jetstream exists in the warm air (in front of the cold front), with its \"core\" high up away from the surface, and near the top of where the cold front extends up to. This would usually mean being above the inversion when referenced to a single location, but is a little unclear in this question This may be what the examiner is referring to, so if anyone has exam feedback about the wording of the correct answer, it would be very useful to verify this question.

Turbulence is caused by violent or unsteady movement of air, and describes the effect of the aircraft being jolted around in flight, often unpredictably, putting increased strain on the airframe and decreasing passenger comfort. It can be caused by vertical movement of air \"pockets\", through either convective or mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called windshear. Clouds can be a good indication of the air patterns present, as stratiform clouds show stable, non-turbulent air, and cumuliform clouds show the presence of unstable, turbulent air. Cumulus clouds are formed when air rises, and by doing so, becomes warmer than its environment, due to a high ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate, the air wants to continue to rise. Rising air cools down, and therefore becomes closer to the dewpoint (the relative humidity rises) until the dewpoint is reached, and the air becomes saturated, forming a cloud. Therefore, the air just below a cumulus cloud is rising at quite a rate, but not perfectly evenly, due to unstable heating, meaning that there is a large difference in updraft speed from one pocket of air to the next, which causes lots of turbulence. The base of a cumulus cloud often has more turbulence than the rest of the cloud, on average. Downdrafts can also occur in cumulus clouds, and this would cause even greater turbulence, when happening next to an updraft.",

It is also very much an ATPL question only, as it refers specifically to what we are supposed to know about meteorology, and does not include any further knowledge. Please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and what you remember from it, so we can verify the question and options, thank you! There are a few different bits of knowledge that you need here. Firstly, you must understand the global circulation pattern of air around the Earth. Things such as; where is a consistent high pressure surface zone, the ITCZ, ascending and subsiding air zones, and particularly travelling lows. Then you must understand how the jet streams are formed based on that global circulation. Finally, you must understand how jet streams are affected by (and affect) the surface weather conditions, and then you have to link all that information together. When you do, you find that the correct answer is the polar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere. Some people will be happy to leave it at that, and know the answer, but for those of you who want to know why, see the explanation below. It will have to skip over lots of details, as there are a lot of topics to link together here and this explanation could get huge if everything were to be explained in full. Assuming you know about the global circulation pattern of air, you will know that the polar front (between the Ferrel cell and polar cell of the atmosphere) creates \"travelling lows\", also known as polar front depressions. For the purposes of the exams, these form somewhat consistently over the oceans; for us in Europe, we see the ones flowing from the Atlantic. There are a few different jet streams that form over the Earth. There are the subtropical jet stream over the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, which is quite consistent, as well as the polar jet stream, also in both hemispheres and relatively consistent through the seasons. There is an arctic jet stream that forms over the pole which is in its winter (polar night - extremely cold). There is also a jet stream which flows the opposite way to the others (it is Easterly rather than the usual Westerlies) which is the equatorial jet stream, forming around June-August. The jet streams have a large effect on the surface weather, particularly that beneath them, and this relationship goes both ways, with the surface pressure patterns and surface temperature very much affecting the jet stream's flow, speed and direction. In particular, the jet stream we must know most about is the polar jet stream, and this is the one that sits above (not directly above - but close to) the surface level travelling lows on the polar front. Each travelling low causes the polar jet stream to bend, as the polar front is bent as part of the frontogenesis cycle. This is what the question is asking. The other jet streams are not bent as strongly or as often as the polar jet stream, due to their different circulation patterns. Thankfully, it is not asked in this question, but between the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and the Southern Hemisphere polar jet stream, we would say that they both bend significantly, but the much greater amount of landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere create a more \"unstable\" jet stream, in that has much less regular movements, whereas the Southern Hemisphere has a lot less land to interfere with the jet stream. Travelling lows still form in the Southern Hemisphere, but have a more regular pattern.",

            "explanation": "It is important to realise how pressure systems act in the different hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Southern Hemisphere is the other way around: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. In the case of this specific question: The aircraft is flying on a heading of 270, so flying west. If the wind would come from 360 degrees (so from the right side of the aircraft) the true altitude would be increasing. Imagine standing with your back into the wind, so facing South. The low-pressure area would be on your left side (this is also the side the aircraft is coming from). And the high-pressure area would be on your right. We know that if we fly from a low to a high-pressure area the true altitude increase. If the QNH in an area changes, we have to think about what consequence this has on our flight. Since we fly on a Flight level (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But our actual flight level will. Because the altimeter is only accurate in the Standard Atmosphere and we now are experiencing a higher actual pressure, the altimeter will under read. The actual altitude will be higher. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below! This is correct for both pressure and temperature.",

Sea breezes are most likely to occur on a sunny day, especially when an anticyclone with a gentle pressure gradient force (PGF) dominates the area, leading to rapid heating of the land. As the air in contact warms up, it expands and rises, creating higher pressure at approximately 1000 feet above the land compared to the same level over the sea. This pressure difference prompts air to flow from over the land to over the sea at around 1000 feet altitude. Consequently, surface pressure over the land decreases while surface pressure over the sea increases. This atmospheric setup results in a movement of air from the sea toward the land, known as a sea breeze. Note: The land-breeze blows during the night and is weaker than the sea-breeze.",

If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3.

We kindly ask anyone who comes across this question to let us know. Lenticular clouds typically form downwind of mountainous or hilly terrain and indicate the presence of mountain waves. Even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near. Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. In this scenario, despite the absence of returns on the airborne weather radar, the aircraft could encounter clear air turbulence as a result of mountain wave activity.",

When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) that makes it flow with a stronger wind speed - as the cross section decreases, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases.

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

The PGF is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE. This wind is called surface wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (first annex above). In this diagram, the free stream wind (gradient wind - as it is orbiting the low) will simply follow the isobars anti-clockwise around the low, not getting any closer. The surface wind, on the other hand, is directed slightly inwards (second annex above), so spirals inwards. This means that aircraft \"C\" is pointing directly into wind, and it is also in an area of tighter isobars, meaning that the windspeed will be higher aswell.",

            "explanation": "A synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area. Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force. The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. This makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more. The outflow of air from a high is called divergence. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days. The inflow of air into a low is called convergence. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather. In this question, they are asking about the atmospheric convergence from a low pressure zone. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel across the isobars and towards towards the low pressure.",

As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night. A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion. The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

Further information: MOUNTAIN/LEE WAVES develop on the lee, or downwind, side of mountains. If sufficient moisture is available in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds may form serving as an useful warning of such waves. These clouds are: LENTICULAR. lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found at several levels, sometimes up to the tropopause. Normally airflow through these clouds is smooth - Ragged edges indicate turbulence. ROTOR/ROLL-CLOUDS often indicates the presence of a rotor phenomenon. Occurs under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind (located below the first crest). CAP clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes. May be an indication that there might be more dangerous mountain wave phenomena on the downwind side.",

Jet streams can be described as a core of strong winds (speeds >/= 60 kts) around 5 to 7 miles above the Earth’s surface, generally blowing from west to east. These occur as a result of strong horizontal temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. There is a strong relationship between jet streams and clear air turbulence. CAT is caused by the vertical and horizontal wind shear of jet streams. CAT is most severe on the cold side of the jet, next to and just underneath the axis of the jet and not in the core of the jet stream => across the core, temperature is more or less constant. “At 500 ft/AGL mechanical turbulence occurs more often than at 5000 ft/AGL.” CORRECT. Mechanical Turbulence (Frictional turbulence) - is caused by physical obstructions to the normal ﬂow of air such as hills, mountains, coasts, trees and buildings. This kind of turbulence will increase as the wind speed increases. It occurs within the friction layer (2000 – 3000ft).",

This causes a change in wind direction – wind blows somewhat across the isobars towards the low pressure. As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic - and blows parallel to isobars. => Frictional forces cause the wind to convergence at the surface around a LOW and diverge around HIGH.

As the wind gains speed, the deflection increases until the Coriolis force equals the pressure gradient force. At this point, the wind will be blowing parallel to the isobars. When this happens, the wind is referred to as geostrophic. The geostrophic wind is directed parallel to isobars and the strength is directly proportional to the spacing of the isobars. It is found at altitudes of around 2 000 feet and above. The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Thus, the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction and the isobars were perfectly straight. In case of this specific question: True altitude remains constant, so we will be flying at at constant pressure which will be parallel to isobars. Geostrophic wind is parallel to isobars so we will not have any crosswind. That is why this statement is correct.",

These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance. The Gradient wind occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow.

Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because the tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes), due primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together, flowing from West to East. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall. All Jet streams flow from West to East (except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream). In the Northern Hemisphere, that is because the tropopause South of the jet stream is higher than the tropopause to the North. It is important to note that the boxed numbers (\"300\", \"380\", etc.) are the indications of the pressure altitude of the tropopause in flight levels. This notation is used in high altitude charts such as sig wx charts.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.02.02.01.07: Explain the gradient wind effect and indicate how the gradient wind differs from the geostrophic wind in cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation. This question is made up of two parts, first we need to know which latitude the wind will be weakest at, and secondly we need to know whether high or low pressure zones (anti-cyclones or cyclones) have the lowest gradient wind speed. To start, we have to understand how the (geostrophic) wind works. 1. Initially, wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF), from high to low pressure. 2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If the Coriolis Force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces). The Coriolis Force is directly proportional to the speed of the wind, so when we have a high PGF, we need a high CF to oppose it, and the wind flows faster. The Coriolis Force also gets stronger away from the equator, due to the changing distance from the Earth's rotational axis (barely any change around the equator, lots of change up at the poles). This means that, near the equator, air has to get a lot faster to work up enough Coriolis Force to oppose the PGF, meaning higher wind speeds. Therefore, the further away from the equator (the higher the latitude), the slower the wind speeds (for the same PGF, which is the isobar spacing) Next, we must understand what the gradient wind is, and when it is strongest/weakest. Previously, we have spoken about the geostrophic wind, which is the wind that flows along straight isobars. That is a rarity though, and more often, isobars are curved, meaning that the wind is turning. This introduces imbalanced forces, which cause this turning of the wind. Note: There are a couple of different ways to reason and understand gradient winds, centrifugal force and centripetal force. Centrifugal force is not actually a force at all, it is the effect of inertia in a turn. Nonetheless, you may have learnt either of these two ways. We believe centripetal force is slightly easier to explain in text format, so we will do that. If you wish to take the easy road here, remember that, for the same isobar spacing (same PGF), gradient wind speed is LOW around a LOW, and HIGH around a HIGH. This means the wind is slower around a low pressure zone (cyclone) and faster around a high pressure zone (anticyclone). This should be sufficient for the vast majority of questions. If you would like to gain a slightly higher level of understanding, continue reading. The change of direction of the wind happens because of imbalanced forces, and the two main forces on the wind are Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and Coriolis Force. If either becomes larger than the other, then the wind will bend in that direction. This means that in a high pressure zone, for instance, the PGF outwards is not as strong as the Coriolis Force inwards, as the wind is bending in the direction of the Coriolis Force. To do this, the wind has to go faster than usual (usual being the geostrophic, straight line wind), to build up a higher Coriolis Force. The opposite is happening around the low pressure zone. The PGF is stronger than the Coriolis Force, meaning that the resultant, or \"residual\", force is going inwards towards the low. This means that the Coriolis Force is weaker than usual, and therefore the wind speed is less than the geostrophic wind. This \"residual force\" is what we call centripetal force, and is the force which causes rotation to occur. It is a force towards the centre of rotation, and without it, objects will just continue in the same direction. We need centripetal force to allow wind to bend around low and high pressure zones, and it comes from imbalanced PGF and Coriolis Force, which causes the low around a low and high around a high behaviour we have discussed. Remember, the PGF stays the same, but the Coriolis Force changes due to the wind speed. In conclusion then, to get the weakest wind speeds with the same isobar spacing, we need a high latitude and a low pressure zone, so 50ºN and a cyclonic system.",

This scenario is characteristic of high-pressure, or anticyclonic, weather systems, which typically denote fair weather conditions. On the other hand, when air converges at ground level and spirals inward, it forces the air to ascend. As the air rises, it expands and cools, potentially leading to cloud formation. At higher altitudes, the upward-moving air can diverge. This pattern is typical of low-pressure systems, or depressions, which frequently result in cloud formation and precipitation.",

Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed, this which directly reduces the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force (PGF). The PGF is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE. This wind is called surface wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (first annex above). In this diagram, the free stream wind (gradient wind - as it is orbiting the high) will simply follow the isobars clockwise around the high, not getting any closer. The surface wind, on the other hand, is directed slightly outwards (second annex above), so spirals outwards. This means that aircraft \"B\" is pointing directly into wind, and it is also in an area of tighter isobars, meaning that the windspeed will be higher aswell.",

As this air sinks, it compresses and warms up, often dispersing any cloud cover that may be present. At the surface, the air diverges. This scenario is characteristic of high-pressure, or anticyclonic, weather systems, which typically denote fair weather conditions. On the other hand, when air converges at ground level and spirals inward, it forces the air to ascend. As the air rises, it expands and cools, potentially leading to cloud formation. At higher altitudes, the upward-moving air can diverge. This pattern is typical of low-pressure systems, or depressions, which frequently result in cloud formation and precipitation.",

So if you were to travel from south to north = Warm sector to cold sector beneath the core, temperatures would decrease. Note: Above the cold sector tropopause the temperature remains constant. But on the warm sector, temperatures will continue to decrease until it reaches the tropopause. Which means that above the jet core, temperatures are colder in the warm sector.

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

GEOSTROPHIC FORCE The geostrophic wind flows parallel to straight isobars, limiting its movement to a straight trajectory. The geostrophic wind is under the influence of two primary forces: the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and the Coriolis Force (CF). The PGF prompts air movement from regions of high pressure towards those of low pressure, acting at a right angle (90°) to the isobars. In the absence of the Coriolis Force, air would move directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, perpendicular to the isobars. However, the Coriolis Force (CF) plays a role in the air's motion, which changes with latitude and wind speed. (At the Equator, CF is negligible and it strengthens as one moves towards the poles; it also intensifies with increasing wind speed.) As the air begins moving, the CF, acting at a 90° angle to the airflow, deflects it (to the right in the Northern hemisphere). When the CF combines with the PGF, the airflow's velocity increases due to this additional force. Consequently, the CF's influence grows, leading to further deflection and increased speed, creating a feedback loop. Eventually, the CF strengthens to the point of equilibrium with the PGF, causing the airflow to become parallel to the isobars. The Geostrophic Force increases with the speed of the air, and it is dependent on the sine of the latitude, being maximum at the Poles (sin 90° = 1) and zero at the Equator.",

Please send any exam feedback to us via the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This question is quite difficult to answer, as jet streams do cause very intense clear air turbulence due to vertical and horizontal windshear. Mountainous areas can produce mountain waves, especially when a stable atmosphere exists (so the air flows down again after being forced upwards), and mountain waves can travel way up into the atmosphere when there is a gradually strengthening wind, which would likely be the case if a jet stream is present at high altitudes. The aircraft is a jet aircraft in the cruise, so we can assume it is at high altitude, around the region of 30 000 - 45 000 ft, just inside or above the jetstream. To give an answer to this question, we can be almost certain that there will be clear air turbulence occuring due to the jetstream, and we could potentially expect to see some mountain waves from the mountainous area below, but that is a much bigger assumption to make, and it is definitely not assured that mountain waves will form at all, and therefore even less likely that we will feel them at cruising altitude. Therefore, we are more likely to see clear air turbulence. Also, mountain waves do cause turbulence, often without clouds, so the effect is also classed as clear air turbulence. To deal with the less likely options, cumulonimbus activity and altocumulus clouds require an unstable atmosphere.",

            "explanation": "This question refers to convective turbulence which arises from convection currents triggered by solar heating (insolation). These currents disrupt the typical airflow, with variable convection intensifying this effect. Often referred to as thermal turbulence, it's particularly pronounced around 3:00 pm during clear, sunny conditions. Notably, convective turbulence isn't present over the sea. In the morning, the atmosphere is typically more stable due to cooler temperatures overnight. This stability tends to keep the air closer to the ground calmer. In stable conditions, the vertical movement of air is limited, and hence, the up currents created by the surface friction are limited as to the height they can reach. So, when you're flying early in the morning, the turbulent layer, where you might encounter bumpy air, remains below 2 000 feet. This means that at your cruising altitude of 2 500 feet, you're likely to experience smoother flying conditions. On the other hand, in the afternoon, the sun has been heating up the ground for several hours, causing the air near the surface to become more turbulent due to convective processes.",

However, the altitude of the tropopause and the thickness of the troposphere can vary. Over the poles, the tropopause is relatively low, at about 8 km to 10 km, whereas over the equator, it can reach approximately 16 km to 18 km. To illustrate this with a basic example, imagine a partially inflated balloon where the skin of the balloon represents the tropopause, trapping the air inside. When the balloon is heated, the air inside expands, pushing the skin outward. Similarly, when the air in the troposphere heats up, it expands and pushes the tropopause higher. This phenomenon occurs at the equator. Conversely, at the poles, the cooler air causes the air in the balloon to contract, bringing the skin closer to the center. Therefore, the tropopause is much lower over the poles. The height of the tropopause is influenced by the temperature of the air in the troposphere near the surface. Warmer air leads to a higher tropopause, while cooler air results in a lower tropopause. For example, during winter, the tropopause is lower due to colder surface conditions. In summer, with warmer surface conditions, the tropopause rises.",

            "explanation": "In the real atmosphere the tropopause is a continuous surface. INCORRECT. The tropopause is not always one continuous surface. Often there is a distinct tropopause above the tropics with a break at around 30° latitude where a new tropopause forms at a lower level. That tropopause slopes downward toward the pole and sometimes shows another break. A jet stream is often found in these tropopause breaks, which become regions of mixing between troposphere and stratosphere. The height of the tropopause in the ISA is 11 km. CORRECT. The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet (approx. 11 km). You can easily calculate it as follows: To find ISA standard temperature for a given altitude, here's a rule of thumb: double the altitude, subtract 15 and place a - sign in front of it. => (For example, to find ISA Temp at 10,000 feet, we multiply the altitude by 2 to get 20; we then subtract 15 to get 5; finally, we add a - sign to get -5.) ISA Tropopause temperature = -56.5ºC 15ºC – 2ºC x Y = -56.5ºC Y = (-56.5ºC – 15ºC) / 2 Y = approx. 36 Which means 36000 ft. (11 km)",

After insolation has occurred, the surface of the Earth warms up, and produces longer wave radiation (infrared radiation), as well as conduction and convection, which heats the atmosphere from the ground. The greenhouse effect is how the Earth manages to keep its heat in. The greenhouse gasses mostly allow the short wave radiation to penetrate down to the ground, but then keeps a lot of the longer wave radiation in, similar to a greenhouse, which lets shortwave radiation (sunlight) in through the glass walls, but keeps the long wave infrared radiation in to warm up the internal atmosphere for the plants. If the Earth did not have any greenhouse effect, the atmosphere would get very cold, particularly during the night. The greenhouse effect comes from the presence of many different gasses in the atmosphere, and include water vapour, and to a certain extent, clouds as well. The majority of the atmosphere exists beneath the tropopause, within the troposphere, and therefore the vast majority of atmospheric heating happens below the tropopause. The radiation which is trapped is the infrared (long wave radiation), and the ultraviolet from the Sun is allowed to pass through the greenhouse gasses (CO2, NO2, etc.).",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature here increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). This layer is considered turbulence free because the warm air over the cold air mass acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere.",

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 12 290 ft - 5 100 ft = 7 190 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 190/1000) = -575 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­12 865 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. The local pressure equals standard, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL130. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Now, think about how the ground, like the surface of the Earth, is like a warm stove. When the ground gets heated by the Sun during the day, it starts to warm up the air molecules directly touching it. This process is called conduction. Just like when you touch a hot pan on the stove and feel the heat transferring to your hand, the ground transfers its warmth to the air molecules nearby. So, the lower layers of air, those closest to the ground, get warmed up by this direct contact with the warm Earth. As these air molecules heat up, they start moving around faster, spreading the warmth to other nearby air molecules. This sets off a chain reaction, warming up the lower levels of the atmosphere. Convection, radiation, and latent heat also play important roles in heating the atmosphere, but when it comes to how the lower levels get warmed up by the ground, it's primarily through conduction, this direct transfer of heat through molecular interactions between the ground and the air.",

The difference between 1013 hPa and 993 hPa is 20 hPa (1013 - 993), so the altimeter is set at a value 20 hPa too high. This corresponds to a difference of 540 feet (20 hPa x 27 ft/hPa). If we would set the actual pressure of 993 hPa on the altimeter, we would go from a higher to a lower pressure. That is why we have to deduct 540 ft from our current indication of 1200 ft = 660 ft.

In this case, the aircraft is flying to a place with higher pressure, but keeps the old QNH set on the subscale and continues flying at what they think is 5 500 ft. However, this is not 5 500 ft anymore, as the aircraft has actually gradually changed altitude during the flight due to the change in surface pressure. To calculate whether the aircraft has gained or lost altitude, we can use the rhyme: \"High to Low, Beware Below\" Meaning that if flying from high to low pressure, the actual altitude is reducing (if we don't change the altimeter subscale. We are flying from low to high, so have the opposite issue; we are getting higher. The amount can be easily calculated by multiplying the pressure change by 27 ft/hPa (given in the question, if not give, use 30 ft/hPa) Altitude increase = (1016 - 968) x 27 = 48 x 27 = 1 296 ft This means the new altitude is 5 500 + 1 296 = 6 796 ft However, the question asks us for our height, which is measured above ground level (agl). We therefore just remove the elevation of the ground from 6 796 ft. Height (agl) = 6 796 - 650 = 6 146 ft",

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL120 and FL60 individually or to the layer thickness (FL120 - FL60). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 240 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 6 240 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Important aspects in this question: It is a very cold winter’s day. The aircraft is flying at an altitude with regional QNH. In the case of this specific question: Because it is a very cold winter’s day the density is increased. The altimeter will overread and the true altitude will be lower than indicated. If you would go up 27 feet the amount of pressure would decrease faster than in ISA conditions, it would be more than 1 hPa (millibar). So that is why at the altitude of the summit the pressure would be lower than in normal standard atmosphere conditions (ISA). Compared to the elevation of the summit the aneroid altimeter will give a higher indication. And this would be a dangerous condition when you fly in IMC conditions because you have less clearance with the mountain. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below!

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL70 and FL40 individually or to the layer thickness (FL70 - FL40). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a colder air mass, the deviation is a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 120 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 2 880 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Please let us know if you get this in the exam, and send us any feedback you can remember, thank you! The aircraft has been cruising above the transition layer, in reference to a flight level, so has had standard pressure setting (1013.2 hPa) set. This means that the altimeter is indicating the pressure altitude of the aircraft. If the pilot forgets to change the subscale to the QNH of 1006 hPa, the aircraft will not indicate the correct altitude when flying below the transition layer, and will therefore be wrong when at the platform altitude of 5000 ft. Converting from pressure altitude to indicated altitude (altitude with QNH set) will tell us how high the aircraft actually is when the pilot flies at 5000 ft (with 1013 hPa set), as there are no differences in temperature from ISA, therefore indicated altitude = true altitude. Indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. Indicated altitude varies from pressure altitude by the amount of hPa difference multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which is 30 ft/hPa. 1013 - 1006 = 7 hPa 7 x 30 = 210 ft No temperature correction, so the aircraft's true altitude is 5000 - 210 = 4790 ft.",

It varies from true altitude by a difference in temperature from ISA, and varies from pressure altitude (flight levels) due to a difference in pressure setting between QNH and standard pressure setting (1013.25 hPa). If the QNH pressure is set, and the pressure changes but the pilot does not change the altimeter subscale, then the aircraft's true altitude will change without the pilot noticing. This is the same for temperature changes. The rule for both pressure and temperature changes is: High to Low, Beware Below. This means that any decrease in pressure or temperature will cause our true altitude to decrease, and vice-versa. So in this scenario, the static pressure decreasing would cause our true altitude to decrease without the altimeter needle moving. The radio altimeter is not affected by such errors though, and will be a very useful indication of our true altitude, especially whilst flying over the sea. A decreasing radio altimeter indication therefore means that either the radio altimeter is broken, or the pressure is decreasing. On the balance of probabilities, it is much more likely that the pressure is decreasing.",

            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the right, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from low pressure to high pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually increase. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the right, the aircraft's true altitude will be increasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be increasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

The lowest temperature of the day usually occurs then. But why is this temperature after sunrise, you might think? At dawn, when the first light beams across the landscape, the incoming solar radiation is very weak. It does not yet have enough strength to counter all the heat escaping from the surface. As a result, the surface continues to lose heat for some time following sunrise, and the air temperature continues to fall.

This reflection prevents a considerable amount of solar energy from reaching the Earth's surface, resulting in cooler maximum surface temperatures compared to when the sky is clear. At night, the situation changes. Clouds have the ability to absorb and trap thermal radiation, particularly infrared radiation, which is emitted by the Earth's surface. As the surface loses heat energy through radiation, the clouds absorb this infrared radiation. The absorbed energy is then re-radiated back towards the surface, effectively acting as a blanket or insulator. This re-radiation of the absorbed infrared radiation by clouds helps to maintain warmer surface temperatures during the night compared to clear sky conditions.",

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­270 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 25 000 ft + 270 ft = 25 270 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-35 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-50 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (25 270/1000) = -1 516 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 25 270 ft - 1 516 ft = ­­­­­23 754 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. In the case of this specific question: Because QNH at Palma de Mallorca is the same as in Marseille the pressure is not changed. If, however the true altitude is constantly increasing this would mean that the temperature must be changing. The only way the true altitude is increasing is if the temperature is increasing (warmer than ISA altimeter will under read). Because we now know the altimeter functions correctly no actions should be taken. The increase of true altitude is due to the warmer air mass over Palma de Mallorca.",

Imagine that you are in an airfield at MSL, you measure QFE and obtain i.e. 1020 hPa Now, reduce it to MSL with standard conditions to obtain QNH. You are already at MSL, the value is the same.

Effects of Cold Temperature on Baro-vertical Navigation (VNAV) Vertical Guidance Non-standard temperatures can result in a change to effective vertical paths and actual descent rates when using aircraft baro-VNAV equipment for vertical guidance on final approach segments. A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate. Pilots should consider potential consequences of these effects on approach minima, power settings, sight picture, visual cues, etc., especially for high-altitude or terrain-challenged locations and during low-visibility conditions.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft (14 200 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-23ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft = 9 700 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (9 700/1000) = -970 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­17 170 ft. The minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is 17200 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 10 600 ft (8 600 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -9ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-9) × (10 600/1000) = -382 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­10 982 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 486 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 10 982 ft + 486 ft = 11 468 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies an westbound magnetic track VFR flight. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL125. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Mountains deflect the direction of the air flow, which can cause pressure changes. This, in turn, may influence the pressure altimeter reading. When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop and resulting air density decrease. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude, leaving the airplane at a lower altitude than indicated. This effect mirrors flying from a high-pressure system to a lower-pressure system. Consequently, if the pilot maintains a constant indicated altitude, the true altitude will decrease. The barometric pressure drop when encountering the venturi effect in a mountainous area can be as much as 33 hPa in extreme cases, leading to a dangerous altimeter error of as much as a thousand feet.",

If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. We leave A with a QNH of 986 hPa set on the altimeter. We maintain an indicated altitude of 4 500 feet. Over B the QNH changes to 1011 hPa, but we still maintain with 986 hPa set on the altimeter. The true (actual) altitude of the aircraft at B will change now by: 1011 – 986 = 25 hPa. Close to the ground 1 hPa represents 27 feet. 25 x 27 = 675 feet Because the we are flying to the higher-pressure area without changing our altimeter our true altitude will increase by 675 feet. So, we will actually be flying at 4500 + 675 = 5 175 feet. The question asks for the height of the aircraft above the surface at B (elevation = 690 ft), 5 175ft – 690ft = 4 485 feet.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­-5 ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-24ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -19ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -19ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-19) × (8 000/1000) = -608 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 608 ft.

The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 621 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 608 ft + 621 ft = 9 229 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 9 229 ft, which is FL100. RULES.

These capsules are typically sealed and contain a fixed amount of air at a reference pressure. As an aircraft ascends, the atmospheric pressure outside the capsule decreases. Since the capsule is sealed, the pressure inside remains constant. This pressure differential causes the capsule to expand. Conversely, as the aircraft descends and the outside pressure increases, the capsule contracts. These changes in the capsule’s shape are mechanically linked to the altimeter's needle or digital display, translating the pressure changes into altitude readings. The aneroid capsule is specifically sensitive to low pressure. This is because, at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is significantly lower than at sea level. Therefore, the altimeter must be able to accurately detect and respond to these lower pressures to provide precise altitude information.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 6 430 ft (2 000 ft + 4 430 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­+10ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+9ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -1ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -1ºC. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-1) × (4 010/1000) = -16 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 6 446 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa = 19 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 513 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft = 6 959 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is FL70. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL190 and FL70 individually or to the layer thickness (FL190 - FL70). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 240 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 12 240 ft. RULES.

            "explanation": "There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots: True Altitude - The actual altitude above MSL (mean sea level). Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure. Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True. In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question, they give us a transition altitude (which would be an indicated altitude), and want us to calculate the corresponding pressure altitude (as that is what the pilot changes to whilst climbing through the transition altitude). This difference requires a barometric (pressure) correction, between the QNH of 1028 hPa and the standard pressure setting of 1013 hPa. A good way to remember the next part is to think that indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. The amount of change is calculated using the difference in pressure multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which in this case is given as 27 ft per hPa. If it is not given, it should be assumed to be 30 ft per hPa. 1028 - 1013 = 15 hPa 15 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 405 ft QNH is high, so Indicated Altitude is high, so the Pressure Altitude is 405 ft lower than 6 000 ft. 6 000 - 405 = 5 595 ft, closest answer 5 600 ft",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 254 ft (6 254 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +24ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 254 ft - 3 100 ft = 5 154 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+24) × (5 154/1000) = 495 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 759 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 759 ft + 660 ft = 8 419 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 8 419 ft, which is FL85. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.

When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. During the departure we climbed through the transition altitude (18 000 feet) and we switched from a local QNH setting of 1023 to a standard setting of 1013,25. We return back to the aerodrome but at the transition level (FL190) we forget to switch back to the 1023 pressure setting on the altimeter. So, we will be landing with the altimeter still set to 1013 instead of 1023. Because we have a lower pressure set than actual, we already know that the altimeter will under read. True altitude will be higher than indicated (going from low to higher pressure). We know 1 hPa represents 27 feet near the ground so: 1023 – 1013 = 10 hPa X 27 = 270 feet So, when we land the altimeter will read 270 feet less than the elevation (323 ft) of the aerodrome. 323 – 270 = 53 feet indicated altitude after landing with 1013 still set on the altimeter. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

Incorrect. \"The intense trough of low pressure would slope the local isobaric surfaces upwards and decrease terrain clearance.\" The local isobaric surfaces simply allow use to visualise the true altitudes where air pressure is a certain value. As this is a trough, the isobaric surfaces dip downwards (not upwards), as the point of a particular pressure will occur closer to sea level in the trough. Incorrect. \"The trough of high pressure raises the local pressure levels and therefore gives additional terrain clearance.\" Troughs are low pressure areas.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 4 237 ft (2 852 + 385+ 1 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­36ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA +21ºC The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +21ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+21) × (4 237/1 000) = 356 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­3 881 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1038 hPa - 1013 hPa = 25 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 25 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 750 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3881 ft - 750 ft = 3 131 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 3 131 ft, which is FL35. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1030 – 1013 = 17 hPa Using the assumed barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft The aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state: When QNH is higher than standard --> Indicated altitude is higher than pressure altitude. When QNH is lower than standard --> Indicated altitude is lower than pressure altitude. The aircraft's indicated altitude is therefore higher than pressure altitude, so their actual pressure altitude is 510 ft lower than the required 5000 ft, making the pressure altitude 4490ft. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used unless specified otherwise in the question.",

First, we need to determine the temperature correction. Given an ISA deviation of ISA -38°C and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-38) × (2000/1000) = -304 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude. Therefore, we subtract the temperature correction from the indicated altitude according to the rules, resulting in a true height of 1696 ft (2000 ft – 304 ft).",

During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern. Advection can be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced.

            "explanation": "When an aircraft departs it is flying on a QNH value. Once it starts climbing it will pass through the transition altitude. Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa. So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting. You would now speak of flight level; the transition levels can be found on SID plates. This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: The question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level. Because the local QNH is 1009 (you came from a standard setting of 1013,25) you go from a higher pressure to a lower one. This means that the altitude shown on the altimeter will decrease.",

These heights are plotted as contour lines (also known as isohypses) with the reference being MSL. The heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL (so the true altitude of a pressure level). Isohypses are plotted on upper air charts such as the 850, 700, 500 and 300 mb analysis and forecast charts. If the contours are high values (in comparison to other values on the chart) then we can assume a high pressure exists. The other way if the contours are lower values then we can assume a low pressure. If the contours are closely spaced, we can assume a high-pressure gradient exists. This wind speed is proportional to the distance between the contour lines. Closely spaced is high pressure gradient means higher winds.",

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 × (+15) × (11 000/1 000) = 660 ft. You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL120 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL120). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 660 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 660 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The tropopause height varies with latitude and season - and it is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. - The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause.

The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C. Calculating the average tropopause height (ft): Tropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280 for winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation. The altimeter is set to the local QNH of 1023, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (12 000/1 000) = 480 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­11 520 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore, pressure correction is disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (34 000/1000) = 2 040 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true altitude of ­­­­­36 960 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 36 960 ft - 29 092 ft = 7 868 ft",

            "explanation": "During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1025 – 1013 = 12 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft The aircraft is 6 000 ft – 5 640 ft = 360 ft lower than remaining traffic. Note 1: The local QNH (1025 hPa) is higher than the standard pressure (1013 hPa). This means that the local QNH datum is lower than the 1013 datum => the aircraft is lower than the remaining traffic. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.",

A ridge is a region with relatively higher pressure. A broad region of sinking air or a deep warm air mass will both lead to ridging. Since air is often sinking within a ridge they tend to bring warmer and drier weather. Fair weather is usually associated with ridges; air under a ridge sinks, which is not conducive for the development of clouds and precipitation.

On warm days the air expands and is less dense than on a cold day, and consequently raises the pressure levels. For example, the pressure level for 5 000 feet will be higher than on a day with standard conditions; the altimeter may indicate 5 000 feet when the airplane is actually at 6 000.

When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude. As altitude is calculated, when compared to the reference pressure setting (i.e QNH), when flying into lower pressure, the true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = the lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins can differ (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. Above the tropics the height of the tropopause can be as high as 20 km. Aircraft almost never fly at such high levels and thus this information is not important to know.",

This air warms up at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) of 3ºC/1000ft, which means that the air quickly gets quite warm, often quite a bit warmer than the air near the ground. This temperature difference will eventually stop the air descending any further, and instead the air begins to spread outward in divergence, but with a layer of cooler air trapped underneath this inversion that has formed. The inversion usually exists at around 2 - 3 000 ft, and can bring a reduction in visibility due to haze and other particles in the air under the inversion. Therefore, the location and time of year for this would be anywhere that gets high pressure systems. Northern continents in Winter, such as Canada and Siberia tend to get very cold, bringing high pressure, so these are correct. Subtropical ocean areas include the belt of subtropical high pressure, so that is certainly correct. Therefore, this option is correct. The Polar regions do have high pressure systems, but less so during the Summer than in the winter. The Equatorial regions tend to have low pressure, due to the intense heating, and the location of the ITCZ (which is a product of this low pressure). Mountainous regions have very varied weather, but you wouldn't expect high pressure for every mountainous region during every season, so incorrect. Note that the Encyclopedia Brittanica quotes the following \"Subsidence inversions are common over the northern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres.\", so we can see where the question writer got this from.",

The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude. The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.” The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans, as is detailed in Learning Objective 050.01.01.03.02.

Air is a poor conductor of heat so only a thin surface layer of air is cooled leaving the air above almost unaffected and therefore warmer. Gentle breezes overnight can cause some mixing of the air near the surface leading to the cool layer becoming slightly thicker as the night progresses. Reduced visibility can be evident below the inversion layer. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result.

For unsaturated air, the lapse rate is 3°C per 1000 feet; this is called the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR). However, when the parcel of air reaches its dewpoint (100% humidity) and becomes saturated, water vapour condenses, latent heat is released during the condensation process, which warms the air, and the lapse rate reduces to 1.8°C per thousand feet (SALR). At higher altitudes and latitudes, where there is generally less water content in the air, and therefore less latent heat to release, the SALR is closer to 3°C per thousand feet. The ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) is the actual rate at which the ambient temperature changes with height. The overall average (ICAO standard atmosphere) rate is a decrease of about 6.5°C/km (2°C per 1000 feet) up to the tropopause (11 km standard), but the rate varies greatly in different regions of the world, in different airstreams, and at different seasons of the year.

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth.

During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern. Advection can be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation to give the appropriate indicated altitude to fly at, when the correct QNH is set. As the correct QNH will be set, there is no need to make any barometric corrections in this question, only one temperature correction is required. The ISA deviation is ISA -12°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (3500/1000) = 168 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 668 ft. Closest answer 3 670 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1 000 = _____ ft The indicated altitude for the above formula might not be known yet, so true altitude may be used instead. If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

Conduction is the process by which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighboring atoms or molecules. Conduction occurs more readily in solids and liquids, where the particles are closer together than in gases, where particles are further apart. The rate of energy transfer by conduction is higher when there is a large temperature difference between the substances that are in contact. Since air is a poor conductor, most energy transfer by conduction occurs right near Earth's surface. Conduction directly affects air temperature only a few centimeters into the atmosphere During the day, sunlight heats the ground, which in turn heats the air directly above it via conduction. At night, the ground cools and the heat flows from the warmer air directly above to the cooler ground via conduction. \"Conduction has less of an effect in heating of the troposphere in comparison to convection.\" Correct. Convection plays a more significant role in the distribution of heat than conduction. \"At night the air can be cooled by conduction.\" Correct. At night, the ground loses heat and cools down, and this cooler ground can then cool the air directly above it through conduction. This process is more significant near the surface where the air is in direct contact with the cooler ground. \"The air is a good conductor of heat.\" Incorrect. Air is actually a poor conductor of heat. Gases, in general, have lower thermal conductivity compared to solids and liquids, meaning they do not transfer heat as effectively through conduction. \"Conduction always occurs at a constant rate.\" Incorrect. The rate of conduction depends on various factors, including the temperature gradient (the difference in temperature between two regions), the thermal conductivity of the material, and the cross-sectional area through which heat is being transferred. Thus, the rate of conduction can change based on these variables and is not constant.",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). 50° N is about half the average latitude (between 0 and 90) so we can say that at 50° N the average height of the tropopause is 11 km.",

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW). Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

To make it more obvious, you can draw the wind general circulation: anticlockwise around a LOW and clockwise around a HIGH, in the NH. You can see that the aircraft will be flying towards a LOW pressure system (from High to Low) => True Altitude will decrease.

            "explanation": "QNH. The atmospheric pressure adjusted to mean sea-level. If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level. QFE. The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. So, it is used to get to know the height above the ground. In the case of this specific question: We need to figure out which of these conditions would give the highest QNH. QNH gives the elevation of the airport from mean seal level. QFE set on the altimeter on the ground would give an indication of 0 feet. QNH will always be a higher value than QFE as long as the airport is above mean sea level. Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa: (1) QFE of 1003 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate the QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1003 hPa = 1047 hPa (2) QFE of 1000 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1000 hPa = 1044 hPa (3) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1039 hPa (4) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1600 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1600 by 27 ft/hPa 59 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1054 hPa => A QFE of 995 with an elevation of 1600 feet will give the highest QNH indication. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. In this particular question, the pressure altitude is not relevant. The given information specifies the height at the QFE setting, and the question is asking for the true height. As per the given question, the aircraft is currently flying at an height of 2 000 ft (while the altimeter subscale is set to airfield QFE). This setting indicates that the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the elevation of the airfield. We need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +12ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the aircraft and the airfield elevation will be taken into account: 2 000 ft (the aerodrome which is located 1000 ft AMSL but the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the airfield). Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (2 000/1 000) = 96 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true height of ­­­­­2 000 ft + 96 ft = 2 096 ft.",

            "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). An altimeter will read an altitude of -69m with the QNH of 1018 hPa set on the altimeter. Because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. QFF is the pressure measured at the airfield adjusted to mean sea level according to the actual temperature conditions. Because of the decreased density/decrease in pressure drop the QNH has been made a lower number compared to QFF to let the airfield still read the correct elevation with QNH set. That way we know that the QFF must be higher than 1018 hPa. So, with warmer temperatures from an airfield below msl it means that QFF is at a higher pressure than QNH. QNH set will give you a negative height and as you climb to zero on your altimeter with QNH set, you will be below msl. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Therefore, we only need to aply the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +23ºC.

The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 4 500 ft + 414 ft = 4 914 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter.",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 999 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to 1013 hPa (the aircraft’s Indicated altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. 6 000 ft = IA + 30 (999 - 1013) IA = 6 000 ft + 420 ft IA = 6 420 ft The aircraft is 6 420 ft – 6 000 ft = 420 ft higher than remaining traffic.

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 400/1000) = -592 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 992 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 992 ft + 690 ft = 8 682 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies an easterly magnetic track. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.

There is also the possibility that the states calculate their true altitude differently. There are a couple of places where the method could be modified ever so slightly, such as deciding which altitude to use as the ISA reference in the temperature correction. This could lead to a lower obstacle clearance answer, but very close to our own. We do still believe our method to be more correct though, given the way the ISA works. The incredibly small difference this makes means it is not usually a factor, and therefore never really talked about. This question gives us a planned Flight Level of 290 (pressure altitude 29,000ft) and some meteorological conditions, which we must use to calculate our true altitude, and then compare to the local highest terrain to find our terrain clearance at this altitude. To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn pressure altitude into indicated altitude. The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 = 31 hPa less than standard pressure. Because we are in low pressure, our indicated altitude is lower than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 = 930 ft lower than the pressure altitude. Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 = 28,070 ft To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate. ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C. As our temperature is lower than ISA, our true altitude will be even lower than our indicated altitude. Temperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet). In this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)1909 ft Therefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 = 26,161 ft This makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 = 701 ft, closest answer 590 ft Note: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 540 ft and 680 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

Please report in the comments if you see this (or a similar style question in an exam, thank you.) To start, we need to know the flight level (pressure altitude), and then the expected ISA temperature calculated to check the temperature in the option. Calculator Trick This is more of a rule of thumb, you go down and across the calculator as shown in the annex above, and the numbers of the buttons are the hundreds of hectopascals, then you count up from 1 to 5, and those are the hundreds of flight levels. For instance, 700 hPa is approximately FL100, 500 hPa is FL 180 (which is close to FL200, a discrepancy of this method), 300 hPa is approximately FL300, etc. Note: 200 hPa actually equates to FL390, and 100 hPa equates to FL510, to be a little more precise. The others are very close, remembering the 500hPa = FL180. We can then use this method to calculate the flight level, and use the formula: ISA temp. = 15 - 2 (pressure altitude in thousands of feet) Also, remember that the ISA temperature reduces by 2ºC down to -56.6ºC, where it then becomes isothermal, so all altitudes above approx. 36 000 ft have an ISA temp of -56.5ºC, up to about 60 000 ft. Using these methods, At 700 hPa, the ISA temperature is -5ºC. At 500 hPa, the ISA temperature is -21ºC. At 200 hPa, the ISA temperature is -56.5ºC. (the ISA temperature does not drop below this value) At 300 hPa, the ISA temperature is -45ºC.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Troposphere = the lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. Conduction = The transfer of heat energy by direct contact. Convection = The transfer of heat by the motion of a matter, the mixing of liquids or gasses. Radiation = The transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation (waves). In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the stratosphere begins can differ. The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The lower boundary of the stratosphere is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The base of the stratosphere is therefore lower near the poles because of the low ground temperatures.",

After take-off, the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes (QNH set) until the Transition Altitude (TA). Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa) and altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels. Pressure decreases with increasing height. Which means that when the pilot changes the altimeter setting from local QNH (1041 hPa), to a lower pressure (1013 hPa), the altimeter reading will decrease. (Increasing the subscale setting increases the altitude readout, decreasing the subscale setting decreases the altitude readout.) Altimeter reading = TA - Pressure difference: 1041 hPa - 1013 hPa = 28 hPa 28 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 840 ft Altimeter reading = 11 000 ft - 840 ft = 10 160 ft",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. Practically taken as the height where the temperature fall is less than 2°C per 1000 ft. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. 1. When we move from the equator to the north pole, the temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the altitude of the tropopause decrease. 2. Due to the overall decrease in temperature with altitude, the temperature at the tropopause is lower/colder equatorward and higher/warmer poleward.",

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (14 500/1000) = -1 450 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­15 950 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 980 hPa = 33 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 33 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 990 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 950 ft + 990 ft = 16 940 ft. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL170. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

In aviation, we have a few different measures of vertical position. 1) Altitude: This is the vertical distance between the aircraft and mean sea level. Measured on an altimeter set to the QNH (remember to factor in temperature errors) 2) Height: This is the vertical ditance between the aircraft and ground level (agl), or sometimes aerodrome level in the circuit (aal). For the height aal, an altimeter with the QFE in the subscale can be used (remembering temperature errors again). 3) Elevation: this is the height of the terrain, airport or obstacle. An object on the ground can have an elevation, but an aircraft would not be considered to have one. 4) Flight Levels/Pressure altitude: An odd one out, this is not an actual height measurement, but is a measurement of the pressure, which then corresponds to a particular \"pressure altitude\" from the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).",

            "explanation": "“The Earth is heated by long-wave radiation from the Sun, but cooled by its own short-wave radiation into space.” Incorrect. Heat is transferred via radiation from the Sun to the Earth’s surface. Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth. “The Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.” Incorrect The Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy. “Cloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.” Incorrect. Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth. Correct. “More heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.” The temperature of an object dictates how quickly they will lose energy to their surroundings. Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects, and thus a hotter planet will shed more energy to space than a colder planet.",

We know that close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft. Therefore: 450 ft / 27 ft = 17 hPa approx. Now, When changing an altimeter setting to a lower value - Altimeter reading decreases. (ie. 1013 hPa to 999 hPa) When changing and altimeter setting to a higher value – Altimeter reading increases (ie. 1013 hPa to 1030 hPa) In this case, we want to increase the altimeter reading by 450 ft (from 4500 ft to 4950 ft). Therefore, we need to add 17 hPa to 1013 hPa for our altimeter to read true altitude of 4950 ft. QNH = 1013 + 17 = 1030 hPa. SECOND METHOD: to simplify your calculations we suggest using the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) + (4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev) Where TA = True Altitude and IA = Indicated Altitude. “(4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev)” can be disregarded in this case because temperature = ISA. TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 (QNH – 1013) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 QNH – 27351 QNH = 1030 hPa approx. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Since we fly on Flight level 120 (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But normally our actual flight level will change if we have non-standard conditions. Our local QNH is 1013. This is the same as according the ICAO standard atmosphere. So, until so far it is logical why the true altitude also indicates 12 000 feet. However, we have to realise that the temperature variation from ISA also affects our true altitude. In this case because true altitude = indicated altitude (and we already know the QNH value is according to ISA)we know that their cannot be any temperature deviation from ISA. True altitude (TA) would have been higher than indicated altitude (IA) if the temperature was warmer than ISA, and TA would have been lower than IA if the temperature was colder than ISA.

QNH is QFE reduced to mean sea level using the assumed conditions of standard atmosphere and the elevation of the airport. If the pilot sets the current QFE into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate zero when on the ground. When the pilot sets the current QNH into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate the elevation of the airport when on the ground. Therefore, in this case, with QNH set in the altimeter window, the altimeter will indicate 1 411 ft. We need to find out the QFE = the altimeter setting that will cause 0 ft indication. When we set a lower value into the altimeter window the altimeter indication decreases and vice versa (higher setting means a higher indication). In this case we need to reduce the altimeter indication by 1 411 ft => we need to reduce the altimeter setting value. Close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft, therefore 1 411 ft reading reduction means a reference value change of approx. 52 hPa (1 411 ft ÷ 27 ft) => QNH 994 hPa - 52 hPa = QFE 942 hPa.

Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude.

In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a Pressure Altitude of 3 300 ft, and also an Indicated Height of 3300 ft. Not only does that tell us that the QNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), but it also tells us that our QFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level. This has the very nice effect of making height and altitude interchangeable. This simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA. ==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude. ==> When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. As this scenario has an OAT of 15ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places). Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA) So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 = 198 ft True Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so True Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 = 3 102 ft * Indicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3.",

In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 983 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1021 hPa - 983 hPa = 38 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 38 hPa x 27 ft = 1026 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 7500 ft - 1026 ft = 6474 ft The elevation at B is 1650 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 6474 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 6474 ft - 1650 ft = 4824 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 983 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 1650 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1021 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 1650 ft + 1026 ft = 2676 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 7500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1021). We need to climb 7500 ft - 2676 ft = 4824 ft (which is our height over the surface). Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

The aircraft's indicated altitude is 4 500 ft. We know that the true altitude of the highest obstacle is 3 120 ft. We must therefore calculate the aircraft's true altitude from the indicated altitude, which is a simple matter of a temperature correction. In an ISA atmosphere, the temperature at the aircraft's altitude (4 500 ft) would be 15 - 2(4.5) = 6ºC. The actual outside air temperature is -4ºC, so the OAT is ISA -10ºC.

As you can see in the attached figure, in the troposphere, the temperature first decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. That is why the temperature laps rate changes abruptly at the tropopause. Recent feedback added the option “temperature and pressure lapse rate change abruptly at the tropopause”, and we think the feedback indicated it as incorrect, as well as the fact that the temperature lapse rate is the major change (and the only one on the syllabus), and the pressure lapse rate is more complex and unlikely to change suddenly due to the beginning of this isothermal layer.",

                "Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here"
            ],
            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature in the stratosphere increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. The warm air over the cold air mass (as in this question is the case) acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). Thus, the layer above the tropopause is absolutely stable.",

As the surface loses heat energy through radiation, the clouds absorb this infrared radiation.

This means that changing the subscale on an altimeter influences the readout on that altimeter in the same direction. Increasing the subscale setting increases the altitude readout, decreasing the subscale setting decreases the altitude readout. Now that we know the direction things go in, the question is very easy. if we are using 30 ft/hPa (which you should always use unless told in the question to use something else), then that difference of 1010 - 992 = 18 hPa reduces the altitude readout by 18 x 30 = 540 ft. 1500 - 540 = 960 ft",

The coolest time of the day is just after sunrise, and the ground and air heat up graddually until early afternoon, when the temperature begins to drop again. This means that between 08:30 and 11:00 local time, the temperature will have risen quite a bit. A rise in air temperature causes a reduction in air density, due to the increased collisions between particles, keeping them further apart. Reduced air density leads to a reduction in the amount of air particles flowing over an aircraft's wings, which leads to a reduction in ift. This means that an aircraft must fly faster to gain the same amount of airflow, to get the same amount of lift. this lengthens take-off distances as the aircraft has to reach a higher speed. The engines are even more affected by temperature rises and density reduction. both piston and gas turbine engines produce higher power when the air is colder (and therefore denser), as there is more oxygen to burn alongside the fuel. Gas turbine engines also become TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature) limited when temperatures get above a certain amount, and this leads to the engine having to reduce their thrust output to stop the turbine melting. Propellers are also affected in the same way as wings, by having reduced air, they produce less power. Therefore, no matter what type of aircraft is being referenced, the power/thrust output will be reduced by the higher heat in the middle of the day, and therefore the take-off climb performance will be degraded.",

Water vapor is the gaseous component of air that is of greatest importance to Earth's weather. Water vapor plays a very important role in the Earth's atmospheric processes and is an important factor in the formation of clouds, precipitation and various weather phenomena. Some atmospheric events where water vapor has significant effects: Condensation and Cloud Formation: Water vapor can condense into liquid water or freeze into ice crystals, forming clouds. Precipitation: Water vapor is the source of all precipitation, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Latent Heat Release: When water vapor turns into liquid water or freezes into ice, it releases latent heat into the atmosphere. Humidity and Temperature Regulation: Water vapor contributes to the humidity of the air that affect how temperatures feel and can affect weather conditions.",

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be higher than 1016 because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will under read, the altimeter would indicate a lower airfield elevation than 400m. If we set a higher QNH, than the temperature correction is compensated. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

The surface radiates heat away as infrared radiation, and therefore the surface cools down. The air in contact with the surface is now warmer than the surface, and so heat will begin to flow from the air to the surface by conduction. This takes heat energy away from the low level air, causing the temperature to drop below the dewpoint, forming fog. Air flowing over a cold surface does a similar thing. The warmer air flows over a colder surface, and heat flows by conduction from the air into the surface. This cools the lower layers of air, and causes the overall ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) to decrease (as the lower air is already cold), often creating an inversion at the altitude where that cold air gradually returns to normal temperature. The lower ELR and potential for an inversion make the air more stable, as any air which is forced to rise (at the DALR or SALR) will then be colder than the surrounding air, so will sink again. This often gives rise to advection fog, where that low level air cools below the dewpoint.",

            "explanation": "True Altitude is the real distance beneath the aircraft to the ground. The TA depends on the mean temperature of the layer of air between the reference pressure surface and the static pressure surface (level of the aircraft) and on the pressure. For pressure correction, we apply a correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between the QNH and the standard 1013 hPa. If the actual QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than indicated altitude. If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated The same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a low pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be decreasing. Thus, true altitude will decrease. In such questions it might help if you remember that turning the knob of the altimeter anti-clockwise (left), the subscale indication decreases and also the altitude indication decreases (needle turning left).",

But normally our actual flight level will change if we have non-standard conditions. Our local QNH now is 1019. Normally (because of the higher pressure) our true altitude would be higher than our indicated altitude. But our true altitude is still 13500 feet. Thus, this will mean that the temperature has to be different than ISA, because if the temperature would have been ISA, our true altitude would have been higher than 13500 feet. The only way our true altitude can be lowered again to maintain 13500 feet (FL 135) is if the conditions where the aircraft is flying in have a lower temperature than ISA.

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at an altitude of 4 000 ft, unless local QNH is set. Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1013 hPa is set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 4 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to the local QNH (the aircraft’s True Altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. TA = 4 000 ft + 27 (1030 hPa – 1013 hPa) TA = 4 459 ft The aircraft is 4 459 ft – 4 000 ft = 459 ft higher than remaining traffic. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used, which would give you a result of 510 ft.",

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (12 000/1000) = -720 ft. You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL110 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL110). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a colder air mass, the deviation is a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 720 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 280 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. In this particular question, the pressure altitude is not relevant. The given information specifies the height at the QFE setting, and the question is asking for the true height. As per the given question, the aircraft is currently flying at an height of 2 000 ft (while the altimeter subscale is set to airfield QFE). This setting indicates that the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the elevation of the airfield. We need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the aircraft and the airfield elevation will be taken into account: 2 000 ft (the aerodrome which is located 1000 ft AMSL but the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the airfield). Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (2 000/1 000) = -96 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true height of ­­­­­1 904 ft.",

            "explanation": "This question is based upon you knowing the relationship between QFF and QNH. QFE is the pressure at the station (or aerodrome) level. QNH is the mean sea level pressure, derived by applying ICAO's standard atmosphere corrections to QFE. QFF is the mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. Considering the above definitions, we can say that, in ICAO's standard atmosphere, when landing at sea level with QNH set on your altimeter - it will read \"0 ft\". Now, this question states that actual temperature at 4 000 ft is -20ºC - Which means that the air is 27ºC colder than ISA (ISA temperature at 4000 ft = 15 - 2 x 4 = 7ºC). => Normally, a standard lapse rate of 1 hPa per 27 ft is used to calculate the difference between QNH and QFE. However, in cold and dense air, pressure changes more rapidly and the pressure change will be more than that. Thus in colder than standard temperature QFF is more than QNH. Since the QFF (actual pressure at MSL) will be higher than the QNH, when the aircraft reaches MSL, the ambient pressure will be higher than the value set on the altimeter (QNH), therefore, it will indicate a value less than zero. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Insolation and clouds The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. The clouds then have an effect on the outgoing infrared radiation, by absorbing this radiation, and re-radiating it back down, creating a blanket around that section of the Earth. This is where a disagreement may occur, as that could be considered to be the clouds \"reflecting\" the infrared radiation back down, but in reality, they primarily absorb the infrared, and re-radiate it in all directions. SUMMARY The clouds reflect UV rays back into space The clouds absorb and re-radiate the infrared radiation from the Earth's surface.",

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Because the airport is situated 400 meters above sea level with a QFF of 1016 and the question states the air temperature is 10 degrees lower than ISA, we can calculate the QNH. 400m x 3,285 = 1314 feet X 1,04 (4 % temperature correction for every 10 degrees below ISA) = 1366,6 feet / 27 (drop of 1 hPa according to ISA near the ground) = 50,6 hPa 1314 feet / 27 = 48,7 hPa 50,6 -48,7 = roughly 2 hPa. So, the QNH will be 1014 and the QFF = 1016. We do not need to do these time-consuming calculations because most of the questions just ask if the QNH would be more or less than QFF. Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is colder than ISA, the air is more dense and thus pressure will drop faster with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be lowered (lower than 1016) because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will overread. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: As you can see in the image, the temperature first decreases with altitude in the troposphere, in the stratosphere the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. So that is why the division between the troposphere and the stratosphere can be made according the temperature profile.",

QNH represents QFE adjusted to mean sea level according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). When QNH is set, the altimeter displays the aerodrome elevation when on the surface and provides an approximate altitude of the aircraft when airborne. Thus, if you had set the QNH to 1023, the altimeter would indicate the airfield elevation upon landing, which is 320 ft. Now, suppose you adjust the subscale to 1013 hPa (standard pressure setting). This adjustment corresponds to a decrease of 10 hPa (x 30 ft/hPa), resulting in a decrease of 300 ft. Therefore, with the altimeter set to standard pressure, it will display an altitude of 320 ft - 300 ft = 20 ft.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 10 000 ft - 690 ft = 9 310 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­0 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +5ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 9 310 ft - 1 500 ft = 7 810 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (5) × (7 810/1000) = 156 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 9 466 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 9 466 ft - 5 000 ft = 4 466 ft (4 500 ft is the closest option). RULES.

This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: We go from a standard pressure setting of 1013,2 to the local QNH setting. The indication now changes from a flight level to an altitude.",

But because it could also be a lower pressure, but a higher temperature (and vice-versa), we cannot make any assumptions about the air mass the aircraft is flying in.

The airmass the aircraft is flying in has only a higher pressure The airmass the aircraft is flying in has only a higher temperature. The airmass the aircraft is flying in has a higher pressure, but a lower temperature (the pressure in this case has a bigger influence). The airmass the aircraft is flying in has a lower pressure, but a higher temperature (the temperature in this case has a bigger influence).
