Redundancy is another word for additional, or duplicate, and means that there is not just one load path or one source for any system. Essentially, to provide the correct amount of safety in the case of a failure under the \"fail-safe\" design concept, there needs to be another option to stop a catastrophic event occurring. For structural items, this is usually multiple load paths, so that if one breaks, the other can take the required forces without fully breaking. For systems, there are usually extra sources (electrical power, hydraulic pressure, etc.) to stop a complete failure of the more essential systems, such as flight controls or landing gear extension.",

Any forces higher than 2.5G can begin to cause irreversible bending of the airframe and are not assured to be withstood by every airframe in a fleet, so it is never recommended to exceed this limit load factor unless extreme circumstances make it necessary for safety.",

Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment.",

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. \"Pilots need to log every landing in order to know when cyclic load limitations may be exceeded.\" Correct. By keeping a record of landings, pilots and maintenance personnel can ensure that the aircraft remains within safe operating limits.

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer. The other options are both substances that are contained by metal, so are certainly not corrosive to it.",

            "explanation": "Operators must follow a constant cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation, and lubrication to prevent corrosion. Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as turbulence, excessive vibration, or high loads during takeoff or landing. Over time, the stress can cause the material to weaken, which can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed. The above image was apparently the result of a hard landing, which makes sense as it is around the main gear. Paint wear and bulges, impact dents and scratches, and faded paintwork may all be cosmetic issues that do not necessarily indicate stress on the airframe. While impact dents may cause localized stress, they do not necessarily indicate continuous stress on the entire airframe.

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you!

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

Flutter is caused by the interaction of aerodynamic forces, inertia forces and the elastic properties of the surface or structure and can lead to the catastrophic failure of the structure. An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards. If the aircraft is subjected to a gust it will shake up and down with the wings flapping at a certain frequency. If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge). Poorly maintained aircraft, particularly those with excessive control surface backlash (play) or flexibility may mean that flutter could occur at speeds below the limit airspeed.",

            "explanation": "A wing is constantly subject to various forces; tension and compression are the main ones, but wings also experience torsion and shearing forces in some cases. When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

            "explanation": "An airframe is the combination of the whole structure of an aircraft. It undergoes many forces during flight, the largest being the lifting force from the wings. Whatever the weight of the aircraft, the wings have to be able to suspend that amount of force with lift, and the vast majority of that force goes through the two wing roots. Hence, they are usually the strongest place on the entire aircraft. A very high stress scenario for the aircraft is pulling any sort of G-force, which requires increasing the load factor of the wings, and that means the lift of the wing has to increase. Large transport aircraft (CS-25) have a \"limit load factor\" of 2.5 G, and must be able to pull 150% of this (3.75 G) before complete structural failure occurs. This means that an aircraft will have to show during testing that the structure (mostly the wing spar and wing root) can withstand a lifting force of 3.75 times its own maximum take-off weight, which can be an incredible amount of force, before failing. Any G-force over the limit load factor is an \"overload\". An aircraft increases its loading during manoeuvres, so in banked turns (the greater the bank, the higher the wing loading), and any abrupt changes in direction, pitch, etc. Also, the loading increases in turbulence and any windshear. Aircraft stress obviously increases with weight, but the limiting load factor is set for the MTOW, so it can only get better as the aircraft gets lighter. VA is the manoeuvring speed, and if flying below VA, the aircraft will be unable to pull its limit load factor during a manoeuvre, as it will stall first, and therefore will not overload the airframe. Headwinds and tailwinds do not affect loading, as the aircraft just flies through the air mass it is in, and the head/tailwinds simply move the air mass forwards or backwards, increasing or decreasing groundspeed. As long as the winds do not change rapidly (windshear), this should not affect aircraft loading.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

            "explanation": "Ensuring accurate calculation of take-off performance data is crucial for reducing the chance of a tail strike during take-off. Knowing the correct rotation speed allows pilots to smoothly lift the aircraft's nose at the right moment. If the rotation speed is too high, it can lead to an excessively steep climb angle, increasing the likelihood of a tail strike as the aircraft leaves the ground. Conversely, if the rotation speed is too low, the aircraft may not achieve the desired pitch attitude for liftoff, potentially causing a tail strike as well. The two major threats for tail strikes to occur are during the landing flare/touchdown and during rotation on take-off. As many large jet transport aircraft are extended in length for larger passenger numbers, the long tail leaves very little tail margin during rotation, and factors such as crosswinds, gusty head/tailwinds and different weight and CG locations can lead to the potential for reduced tail clearance or tail strike. To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

Materials all have different properties, such as their strength, elasticity, resistance to corrosion, weight, cost, heat resistance, etc. The material that is chosen for the vast majority of aircraft construction is usually metal (composites are becoming more widely used in the sector, but metal is still the bulk of the industry). Different metals have different levels of strength, they are different to work with, and are used in different sections of the aircraft. For instance, the fuselage is usually made from an easily manufactured aluminium alloy, but sections of the hot engine are made from the very expensive, but incredibly heat resistant titanium. Alloys are a clever way of combining the different properties of two or more metals to make them better for the required usage. Now to answer this question. In general, metal has a high strength to weight ratio (in that it is strong but also light). The only better type of material for strength to weight ratio is composites. Composites such as carbon fibre, aramid (Kevlar), fibreglass, and plastic composites can be made incredibly strong, but far lighter than metals. Their fibres can also be aligned to create strength in particular directions, which is much harder to do in metal. The answer is not composites though, because they are very resistant to corrosion. Metal, however, is highly susceptible to corrosion, and it is a large part of what engineers check for and treat when they maintain an aircraft.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. Heating elements are added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. The heating elements usually heat the windows into this temperature range, switch off so they do not overheat, then switch back on again if the window is going to cool down too much, cycling like this throughout every flight. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly that restriction is to be not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

Strength-to-weight ratio is an important factor, as materials with a high strength-to-weight ratio are either stronger or lighter than other materials, both of which are useful for aviation. This is why metal and composites are so commonly used for aircraft construction, due to their high strength-to-weight ratios.

Corrosion is unlikely to remove rivets on its own, as they are fused to the skin, and corrosion would have to be incredibly severe (and therefore noticeable) to start removing them completely. Hard landings and high manoeuvring loads can remove rivets, screws, and other fasteners through shearing forces, for example, if the \"improper maintenance or installation\" option is not present in the exam, this option should be chosen. With the options as they are, hard landing and manoeuvring loads are less likely to cause the complete loss of rivets than improper maintenance or installation. Engine failure or malfunction has nothing to do with the rivets really, and they should easily be able to deal with the forces involved.",

The layering of different materials help to provide better impact resistance than one type of material only, combining the best features of all the materials. Aircraft windshields also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds.

The appropriate action to take if an operator notices corrosion on metal parts of their aircraft fleet is to repair, prime, and paint the damaged parts. This is important because corrosion can weaken the metal and compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft, which can be a safety hazard. Replacing the metal parts with plastic or composite materials may be an option, but it can be expensive and may not always be feasible. It is also important to note that different materials have different properties, and they may not be suitable for all applications. Washing the aircraft thoroughly after each flight may be important for general maintenance but may not prevent corrosion. A notable point is that washing the aircraft after every flight could cause some water based corrosion or rusting over time, so is not a good idea to fight corrosion. Painting over the corrosion to protect the area and add strength is not a recommended practice as it does not address the underlying corrosion issue and can lead to further damage. Therefore, the best course of action is to have the affected parts assessed by a qualified technician and have the corrosion removed and repaired, and then properly primed and painted to protect against further corrosion.",

Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage.

A ram air turbine is a small wind turbine that drops from the underside of an aircraft to provide power/hydraulic pressure to important controls in flight. It is not used on the ground, nor would it be useful without any airflow through it. A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc.",

Whilst this is an awful question, which pilots would usually have no business dealing with, it can still be worked out with the normal knowledge from the syllabus. A hydraulic accumulator is a device used to store hydraulic pressure, for the purposes of smoothing out hydraulic pressure changes, and storing the pressure in case there is a loss of hydraulic pump, so a finite amount of pressure remains for further uses. It works by compressing nitrogen inside the accumulator with the force of the hydraulic fluid, and then the high pressure nitrogen is where the energy is stored. There are a few different ways to do this, via diaphragm, with a moving piston between the fluid and the nitrogen, and with no separation at all, just gravity. These are the types of gas charged accumulators, but there are also spring accumulators and even weighted accumulators that can be used. We do not normally look into these though. If an accumulator was mounted horizontally, the gravity option would not keep the fluid in the lines, so would not work. Therefore only a diaphragm or (more likely) a moving piston would be used in this orientation. This should mean that there is no cross-contamination of nitrogen and hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid stays on one side of the piston/diaphragm, the nitrogen stays on the other side. If, as in this scenario, there is an amount of hydraulic fluid leaving the nitrogen release valve, then there must have been some sort of leak between the two, for hydraulic fluid to enter the nitrogen section.",

We can also work this out by thinking about what happens when you de-pressurise a hydraulic system completely. The hydraulic pressure will read 0 PSI, as the fluid is exerting the same amount of pressure on its surroundings as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 PSI greater than a vacuum (i.e. its absolute pressure is 14.7 PSI, or 1013 hPa).

            "explanation": "A \"swash plate pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump, also called a \"demand pump\". This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. Note: The wording is unconfirmed on this question as it came from limited feedback, but we don't expect any significant differences to the real exam, certainly nothing that will change the answer.",

Check valves stop the flow of fluid in one direction and allow free flow in the opposite direction. They are also known as check valves. OPERATION A typical check valve consists of a spring loaded ball and seat inside a housing. The spring compresses to allow fluid flow in the designed direction. When flow stops, the spring pushes the ball against the seat which prevents fluid from flowing in the opposite direction through the valve. An arrow on the outside of the housing indicated the direction in which fluid flow is permitted.",

On its own it is not useful as it has varying pressure output, which could perhaps overpressure a system or burn out the pump motor, etc., so it has to be combined with an automatic cut-out valve (ACOV) which turns this constant voulme output into a constant pressure supply into a system. There are quite a few different ways of creating a constant delivery pump, primarily for the ATPLs we usually think of a gear style pump for this purpose, but for context we have attached an image that shows some possible pump designs. Bear in mind that constant pressure pumps have less options for how they can be constructed (usually an axial piston pump design with a control piston).",

They are often used after a pump in a hydraulic system to do both these jobs, and by doing so increase efficiency and reduce the stresses on the hydraulic system. They can use a diaphragm or a movable piston, with one side connected to the hydraulic lines and containing hydraulic fluid, but with the other side filled with gas (usually nitrogen), which can compress to the same pressure as the system.

            "explanation": "This question is very similar to question 219273, but the feedback is different enough to warrant two questions in our opinion. On some large aircraft (such as the Airbus A320 family), the cargo doors are very heavy and are therefore lifted by hydraulics. They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc. Power transfer units are used to transfer hydraulic pressure (not fluid) from one system to another, but one system has to be pressurised for this to work, and that is not the case in this scenario. External hydraulic power units do not exist for this kind of scenario. That is a fake option, playing on the fact that external air carts and external ground power units can feed the aircraft pneumatic systems and electrical systems, but not hydraulics.",

Early aircraft had a single braking system with no backup or redundancy, meaning that any failure could result in total loss of braking capability. Nowadays, most large passenger aircraft have braking redundancy which is achieved by multiple, independent hydraulic systems backed up by accumulators. These systems allow for several layers of failure without resulting in total loss of braking capability. In most cases, the right hydraulic system supplies the normal brakes. If this is lost, there is an automatic switchover to Alternate Brakes powered by the center system. In addition to supply system redundancy, the brake accumulator is also an emergency source of power for the brakes in many power brake systems. The accumulator is pre-charged with air or nitrogen on one side of its internal diaphragm. Enough hydraulic fluid is contained on the other side of the diaphragm to operate the brakes in case of an emergency.",

Only the simplest hydraulic systems, such as the brake circuit on a light aircraft, are powered by human effort. All advanced hydraulic systems use some form of pump to increase hydraulic pressure and facilitate fluid flow under pressure. Hydraulic systems can be classified as either: Low-pressure systems: Typically operating up to 2000 PSI. High-pressure systems: Typically operating at 3000 PSI, though some aircraft may use hydraulic pressures of 4000 to 5000 PSI. High pressure reduces fluid volume and component mass. However, even at higher pressures, hydraulic fluid is considered incompressible. Very high pressures can induce shear stresses in the fluid, leading to adverse hydraulic effects. Additionally, there is a slightly increased risk of fluid leaks at joints in the lines. Properties High Pressure Low Pressure Weight (similar size aircraft) Lighter due to smaller actuators Higher Force Able to apply extremely large forces Unable to apply larger forces Construction Complex Simple Pressure Yes No",

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It runs at a constant RPM and modulates its volumetric flow output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. In terms of hydraulic pressures, most large transport aircraft have hydraulic pressures in the range of 3000 - 5000 psi as this is a good amount to power heavy control surfaces and landing gear systems, etc. Larger aircraft tend to have higher pressures in general, and the Airbus A380 runs hydraulic pressures of 5000 psi, whereas Boeing 737s run at 3000 psi.",

Given the operating pressure (3000 to 5000 psi) that most aircraft hydraulic systems generate in combination with the environmental conditions and strict safety criteria under which the system must operate, to assure proper system operation and to avoid damage to nonmetallic components of the hydraulic system, the correct fluid must be used. Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. Ideal properties of a hydraulic fluid: Low compressibility: to ensure instantaneous operation; Good lubrication and anti-corrision properties: hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system; High flash point and low flammability: fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components; Low volatility: be resistant to evaporation; Adequate viscosity: the fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures. The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability. “Hydraulic fluids are interchangeable when the compressibility ratio of both is the same” Hydraulic fluids should never be mixed. “Mineral-based hydraulic fluid is dyed purple for identification purposes” Mineral based hydraulic fluid is dyed red. “Hydraulic fluids have a high viscosity because one purpose is also to lubricate the pumps and actuators” Hydraulic fluids have low viscosity.",

Hydraulic fluids are also \"irritating to skin and eyes\" according to the Learning Objectives. This is another reason that we believe that the corrosion answer is most correct. The internal workings of the hydraulic system will be metal, perhaps with special coatings, but certainly not paint. The aircraft is covered with paint though, and anyone who has carelessly bled brakes before will know that brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) is corrosive to paintwork. Whether it will harm the bodywork underneath would depend on the material and the individual fluid. Whilst it should have good anti-corrosion properties, who knows how good those are, especially against different materials. Important Note: We have received conflicting feedback about this question. Any further exam feedback would therefore be very useful to help us verify this question, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments.

This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure.",

An accumulator is fitted to store hydraulic fluid under pressure, dampen hydraulic pressure fluctuations, allow for thermal expansion and provide an emergency supply of hydraulic fluid under pressure to the system in the event of a pump failure. The gas side of the accumulator is charged to a predetermined pressure with air or nitrogen. As the accumulator is fitted and the hydraulic pressure in the system builds up, the gas in the accumulator will be compressed until fluid and gas pressures equalise at normal system pressure. That is why the accumulator gauge will read the same as the hydraulic system is pressurised to. The correct answer mentions that it provides \"hydraulic power\" in the event of a system failure or emergency, which is correct, as the gas is compressed to store energy which keeps the fluid pressurised in order to provide power onto hydraulic actuators if the pumps fail. This is often used for things such as brake applications in the event of a complete hydraulic failure.",

The cylinder and the drive-shaft are coaxial and rotate taking the pistons which can move up and down in the cylinder. The pistons are a connected to shoes to the non-rotating yoke or swash plate. The angle of the swash-plate and thus the piston stroke is varied by the position of the control piston. This piston is controlled by the outlet pressure on one side of it and a spring on the other. If the pump is stationary there will be no hydraulic pressure and so the spring will push the control piston to the right and the swash-plate angle will be maximum. As the pump begins to rotate the pistons will start moving up and down because of the angle of the swash-plate. If the required operating pressure is reached, the control piston will be pushed back to the left causing the swash-plate to be almost vertical and therefore the pistons’ stroke will be minimal. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 2 shows the pump at maximum stroke and picture 3 shows the pump at minimum stroke.",

Larger aircraft with multiple main gear wheels often mount the main landing gear on bogie beams, which are excellent for absorbing direct impacts during landing, but can suffer from very high sideways loads during tight turns whilst taxiing. These sideways loads also put a lot of sideways stress on the tyres, which can only rotate forwards and backwards, of course, so will get unnecessarily \"scrubbed\" during tight turns. This effect can be reduced somewhat by giving the main gear bogie beams a small amount of available steering angle, which is only used in slow speed tight turns, turning the opposite direction of the nose wheel to turn sideways forces into longitudinal forces on the main gear assemblies, thereby reducing stress on the torsional links and reducing tyre abrasion. This also has the added benefit of reducing the turning circle radius of such large aircraft, such as the Boeing B777.",

INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will result in a longer stopping distance on dry runways only. INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never ensure the required stopping distance – take-off has to be avoided. INCORRECT, while manual braking significantly increases the braking distance (50%) this doesn’t mean the stopping distance available isn’t long enough. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. Manual braking When the anti-skid is inoperative the braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never be as consistent and efficient as the auto-brake with anti-skid would.",

The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper.

Please do let us know if you see this question in the real exam and anything you can remember about it, thank you. Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.06: Describe the various protection devices to avoid inadvertent gear retraction on the ground and explain the implications of taking off with one or more protection devices in place: ground lock (pins); protection devices in the gear retraction mechanism. Let's go through the options: \"Insert the ground lock pins.\" Correct. Ground lock pins are for the landing gear when an aircraft has a retractable undercarriage, and they slot into the gear downlock system to make sure that the gear cannot retract whilst on the ground, no matter what happens to the hydraulics or external conditions. For long term storage, they must be fitted. They are part of the pilot's checks before flight, also, as leaving them in will not allow the landing gear to be raised. \"Leave the parking brakes on.\" Incorrect. The parking brakes of an aircraft are just sealed off hydraulic fluid, and leaving them on for extended periods of time can lead to seizing of the brakes, or potentially a leak of the hydraulic fluid through small imperfections in the system, allowing the brakes to gradually release. Aircraft are chocked or tied down for long term storage. \"Leave the flaps in the extended position to release the hydraulic pressure.\" Incorrect. Flaps should be up for long term storage, to avoid wind damage, damage to the mechanism, keep birds from nesting in the flap tracks, etc. The hydraulic pressure has nothing to do with it. \"Always park the aircraft facing upwind.\" Whilst this is best practice, it cannot always be done, and even if you park into wind one day, for long periods of parking, the wind will change and the aircraft will no longer be into wind all the time.",

            "explanation": "When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed, because maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in the RTO mode. If the anti-skid is till operative, by fully pressing the brake pedals the aircraft will decelerate at maximum force. The same as it would with autobrakes on RTO. When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system remains armed This is correct, the autobrakes will not disarm when braking during taxi. When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature The use of reverse thrust will always influence brake temperature as this relieves the brakes. On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides the capability to select a fixed landing distance. The auto-brake systems usually provide a fixed amount of force on the brakes, so not fixed landing distances. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe or lead to a ground collision/runway excursion. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. In certain aircraft, the condition of the brakes can be assessed using the brake wear indication pin (commonly known as the retraction pin). However, this check can only be performed when the parking brake is engaged. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. Safety pins are typically manufactured in highly visible colors, making them easily noticeable from the ground. In situations where the aircraft has been parked for an extended period or is undertaking its first flight after a maintenance check, pilots must exercise heightened vigilance and attentiveness. A check of the ply/speed rating, tread depth measurement, and tyre pressure measurement is usually the job of an engineer, and is not required before every single flight.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to just drop naturally under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversible operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through a mechanical linkage. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. The weight of the gear will also push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical downlocks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. There are other systems available for emergency gear extension, such as electrical or pneumatic, but gravity free-fall is so much more common due to its simplicity and lack of potential failure points. It is often aided by pneumatic pressure or a similar system to release the uplocks though.",

As previously discussed, RTO does NOT provide a predetermined fixed braking force. Instead, it always ensures the maximum available braking power. “Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft.” INCORRECT. As discussed, the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft is by using the autobrakes which will reduce the pilot’s workload and allow them to focus on other tasks, i.e. directional control. “Without pilot input, the RTO mode will automatically brake the aircraft to a full stop.” This one is ambiguous and unfortunately, we have to assume that the pilot has not yet taken the decision to abort take off – meaning that he hasn’t retarded the power levers. As you know, in order to activate the RTO mode, some conditions must be met - One of those conditions is that the pilot has to bring the power levers to the idle position. Only then the RTO will brake the aircraft to a full stop. Even though, this statement isn’t completely wrong, it isn’t completely accurate either.",

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

On the majority of cars, this means the force you apply to the brake pedal pressurises the brake fluid (hydraulic fluid), and this pressure is used to push a piston (actuator) to force brake pads (stators) into brake discs (rotors) connected to each wheel. The harder you push the pedal, the harder the brake pads contact the discs, the more friction is caused, and the harder you decelerate. This is a manual braking system. In light aircraft, the same system is present, but in large aircraft, many thousands of times more braking force is needed, requiring large multi-disk brakes on many more wheels, and your feet are just not able to provide enough force to apply these brakes, no matter how much you go to the gym. This means that the brakes run off the normal hydraulic system, and your feet (or the autobrake - if fitted) are now simply moving a valve to provide more or less hydraulic pressure to the brake actuators. This means that, given large aircraft hydraulic systems can run from 3000 to 5000 psi, these can provide much more braking force, and the power comes from hydraulic pumps, not your feet. PARKING BRAKES Parking brakes operate the same in almost all aircraft, no matter whether you are using manual brakes or a hydraulically assisted system. They use a simple shut-off valve upstream of the brake actuators, and whilst the brakes are being applied, with the pads pushed into the disks, the valve is closed to trap that hydraulic pressure inside the braking system and keep those wheels stopped. The only difference is how much pressure is trapped within the brakes when you set it on. In a light aircraft, you need to push the brakes hard enough when setting the parking brake, or they might not be fully set on. Most large aircraft will not let you make this mistake. If you do leave parking brakes set on for a long time, small leaks within the system may slowly allow the pressure to drop and the brakes might slowly release, or the brakes could go the other way and seize in place, so aircraft should not have them set for too long, and instead chocks and tie-downs should be used to secure aircraft for long periods.",

Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. This is not the case for the RTO mode though. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. This mode uses maximum braking, which will either be limited by the anti-skid system on poor traction surfaces, tyre limitations, or by the maximum brake pressure. The use of reverse thrust is beneficial for stopping distance, but in RTO mode the autobrake will continue to apply maximum braking until disarmed or stopped, irrespective of the deceleration rate. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. Otherwise, the autobrake will stop the aircraft completely.",

The most common kinds you will see are the hand crank, hand pump hydraulic, free fall and pressurized nitrogen bottle systems. These systems are designed for emergency gear extension - not retraction. Failure of gear to retract is not an emergency unless it retracts partially and cannot be extended again A hand crank system is often found on aeroplanes with electric gear systems. The crank is employed to turn the gears that operate the actuators manually instead of through the electric motor. If you fly an aeroplane with a hydraulic system, you might use a hydraulic hand pump system to extend the gear when the primary pump fails. You do so by supplying the necessary hydraulic fluid pressure to the actuator cylinders by pumping a hand pump. A freefall system is another method of gear extension used on aeroplanes that have hydraulic gear systems. A control lever is used to open a valve that releases the system pressure. Hydraulic pressure equalizes on both sides of the gear actuators and allow the landing gear to fall into position through the force of gravity and aerodynamic loads. In the pressurized nitrogen bottle system, the nitrogen is not directly used to actuate the landing gear actuators or brake units but, instead, it applies the pressurized nitrogen to move hydraulic fluid to the actuator.",

The landing gear anti-retract pin is a safety device used in aircraft. This pin is inserted into the landing gear mechanism during ground operations, typically as part of the aircraft's parking procedures, maintenance, or pre-flight checks. The primary function of the landing gear anti-retract pin is to prevent the landing gear from retracting while the aircraft is on the ground. If the pin is left in place, it will continue to perform this function after takeoff, preventing the landing gear from retracting. This would lead to an inability to stow the landing gear, resulting in increased drag and fuel consumption, and potentially impacting the flight's safety and efficiency.",

            "explanation": "“In the RTO mode the auto-brake system provides a fixed level of deceleration.” INCORRECT. If certain conditions are met, the RTO autobrake setting commands maximum braking pressure/power. Therefore, it does not provide a predetermined fixed braking force. “Manual braking is always the best stopping technique for a rejected take-off.” INCORRECT. Especially when conditions are less than ideal (shorter and wet runways), or rejected take off, many flight crews prefer to use the autobrake rather than use manual braking, and devote their attention to the use of rudder for directional control => “the machine does the braking and I maintain directional control”. Autobrake reduces pilots’ workload and allows them to channel their attention to other important duties. Furthermore, with autobrake, the human’s reaction time on pressing the brakes is eliminated – therefore, it is more efficient. “When the RTO mode is armed, the system will operate at any speed when the take-off is aborted.” INCORRECT. The wheel speed must be at least (around) 90 kts and the thrust levers must be moved to idle position. In case of an aborted take off below wheel speed of 90 kts, the autobrake system will not activate. “Without pilot interference an auto-brake system continues to operate until standstill.” CORRECT. Unless the system is disarmed by flight crew pressing the pushbutton switch or applying enough deflection to at least one brake pedal – the autobrake will bring the aircraft to a complete stop.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance. In addition to the main optimised braking function, anti-skid systems offer other functions including: The ASU prevents brake application before touchdown on landing. It will prevent any brake pressure even if brake pedals are pressed before touchdown to allow the stationary wheels to spin-up to speed on contact. Only after spin-up does the ASU allow brake preassure application. The ASU protects against the locking of any wheel during the braking process by avoiding excessive wheel-slip values. The ASU protects against the effects of hydroplanning.",

            "explanation": "Brakes on a car are operated by the driver pushing on the brake pedal, which uses a piston to squeeze hydraulic fluid into the brake lines, which then applies a force on the brake pads, pressing the pads onto the spinning disks to create friction, which gives braking action. This is, of course, a hydraulic system. Hydraulic systems are an excellent way to transfer forces around a vehicle like a car or an aircraft. The main benefit of hydraulics is that the fluid is not compressible, so the force from the brake pedal piston is immediately (and completely) transferred onto the brake pads. This applies to an aircraft as well, as the only difference is that large aircraft brakes use multiple brake pads (stators) and brake disks (rotors), and the braking systems are usually supplemented by the high pressure hydraulic systems that run the rest of the aircraft's systems to gain higher forces than just the pilot's feet can produce. The emergency braking system that is mentioned in this question is to be used in the case of a loss of hydraulic pressure, and extra pressure can be gained by firing a single burst of high pressure gas into the brake lines, which then allow the brakes to be used (not nicely, but better than nothing). Because of the gas (most likely Nitrogen to reduce fire risk) now inside the hydraulic brake lines, the force applied to the pedals is not going to be completely applied to the brakes, as some of the pressure is absorbed by the compression of the gas in the lines. This makes the brakes feel \"soft\" or \"spongy\" underfoot, and not nearly as reactive or sensitive. After this is used, the brake lines will have to be bled again to remove the remaining air in the system, and replace it completely with hydraulic fluid. The gas canister will be replaced for emergency brake system use in the future. Mention of the anti-skid system is there to throw you off. Anti-skid improves braking by stopping the wheels from locking up, so actually increases brake temperature (or does not affect it, depending on the conditions).",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.08: Describe the sequence for emergency gear extension: unlocking; operating; down-locking. All aircraft are different in their emergency gear extension, but on the whole, the concept is the same. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. Many system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. We are assuming that \"activating the uplocks\" in this sense refers to the mechanical unlocking process of the gear uplocks. This is usually a cable that is pulled from the flight deck by some means, which overcomes the spring tension on the uplock, releasing the gear (and/or gear doors) to extend by gravity. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure (not the selector valves, they are different) Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

REJECTED TAKEOFF (RTO) The RTO mode can be selected (armed) only when on the ground. The RTO mode will engage when a few conditions are met, such as being above 88kts and setting the thrust levers to idle (B737). The airbus A320 doesn't have a named RTO mode, but MAX is only ever used for RTOs and it engages when the ground spoilers deploy, which is at or above 72 kt and with thrust levers set to idle. They are all very similar systems, with small variations. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually. It does not provide a constant rate of deceleration as the landing autobrake modes attempt to do. You could argue that it \"applies the anti-skid maximum braking\" as anti-skid would reduce the brake pressure if the traction is not good enough, but this is not mentioned and we would consider this a less correct answer, particularly after looking at the learning objectives and previous questions.",

The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). Autobrakes have quite a simple logic system, depending on their mode of operation, they use the wheel brakes to slow down the aircraft at a pre-determined, constant rate of deceleration (you can think of it as a constant G-force, or a constant amount of knots lost per second). This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

            "explanation": "The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this is done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A means of extending the landing gear and locking it in the down position in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks and hydraulic locks through a mechanical linkage. These can be used to allow the gears to free-fall under their own weight. The weight of the gears will push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position by mechanical means, these down-locks work automatically and mechanically once the gear reaches the down position. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure. Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

As bad as the wording in this question is, the first part is simple. In all aircraft, the landing gear is an active system, in that it requires a power source to function, in this case it is hydraulic pressure that powers it. The landing gear in some aircraft can be lowered passively (gravity extension), but cannot be raised passively. So now for the second part of the question. The power for the hydraulic system in all large aircraft comes from engine driven pumps. These pumps are driven by the auxiliary gearbox connected to one of the engine shafts. Electric hydraulic pumps are also present, and provide the same amount of pressure, but have a much lower displacement as they are much smaller, weaker pumps. Therefore, when landing gear is raised, the vast majority of the load is placed on the engine driven pumps, and is therefore fed by power from the auxiliary gearbox.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objectives 021.04.03.04.04: Describe how an autobrake system setting will either apply maximum braking (RTO or MAX) or result in a given rate of deceleration, where the amount of braking applied may be affected by: the use of reverse thrust; slippery runway. While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

The torsion link provides that mechanical connection between the inner and the outer cylinder (the wheel and the aircraft) in only one direction, preventing sideways movement, whilst still allowing shock absorption by the oleo in the up and down direction, as it moves in and out due to its \"scissor link\" design. The torsion link does carry lots of stress, therefore, when the aircraft wants to turn and the wheel does not. For example, a main wheel (without steering capability) going round a tight corner where the aircraft wants to twist sideways but the wheel does not. Even more than this, a bogie beam with multiple attached landing gear going round a similarly small corner, would have huge amounts of stress through the torsion link.",

There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Incorrect, rudder pedal nose wheel steering does not work when in the air Manual or tiller nose wheel steering offers a larger maximum deflection of the nose wheel as rudder pedal nose wheel steering. Correct, tiller nose wheel steering has a deflection up to 78 degrees where rudder pedal steering has a maximum of 7 degrees.",

            "explanation": "Pre-flight inspections must confirm whether the condition of the tyre is suitable for operation. Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Note: If you find cuts in the tire, it’s important to make sure that they haven’t cut into the ply of the tire. Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. \"5. Oil contamination on the tyre surface\" Correct. Oil contamination (i.e. brake oil, fuel, tar oil, solvents, chemicals) can degrade the rubber of the tire. Typically, the standard approach involves cleaning the tire with Isopropyl Alcohol. However, if the tire becomes sticky, it becomes necessary to replace the wheel. Hydrocarbons have a detrimental effect on rubber, causing it to lose its essential properties, thereby reducing tire performance.",

            "explanation": "“When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides the capability to select a fixed landing distance” INCORRECT. Only a few aircraft do that, I believe the A350 and A380 – where you can actually go into the computer and say “this is the runway we are landing on, and I actually want to vacate at this specific exit” because it has the runway in the database and all the different taxiways off the runway and, therefore, you can use the autobrake and select to vacate at a certain exit and it will make sure you have the right speed to vacate => but that is not the majority of the aeroplanes. Ultimately, it is not very practical because there are a lot of different factors. On most aircrafts, it just provides a fixed deceleration rate but not a fixed landing distance (seen it is subjected to wind as well). You can never say it will precisely take this xxx amount of distance. Hopefully, this makes sense. “The achievable deceleration levels of full manual braking and the auto-brake RTO mode are the same” CORRECT. So if you press on the pedals as hard as you possibly can, it’s going to give you a maximum deceleration rate and it will also ensure that the wheels don’t lock up – which is exactly the same as autobrake max/RTO. If you look at the pushbutton, it says MAX - maximum amount of braking so it is the same as if you push on the pedals as hard as you can. (Don’t forget that you’ve got antiskid which works in conjunction with autobrake as well) => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. But the thing with the autobrake is that, as soon as the pilot decides to reject the take off and closes the thrust levers, then the maximum braking pressure gets applied immediately. Whereas, if you were to take off without autobrake, and then decided to abort the take-off, you’d first think about “right, I have got to close the thrust levers” and then you’ve got to think to press on the brake pedals => so, there’s obviously an element of delay in that. And that is why the stopping distance in the event of a manual rejected take off would be greater, even though the brake pressure on the brakes, would be exactly the same under both circumstances. Hopefully that kind of makes sense. Video Explanation:",

All the tire needs is a new tread. Airplane tires can be expensive: there is no logical reason to scrap a tire for an aircraft when it can be safely and economically reconditioned with a new tread. This is why retreading has been standard practice in the aviation industry for decades. The maximum retread level for the part number is set only after extensive testing and analysis. Some airplane tyres can be safely retreaded up to seven or more times, but there is always a limit and the limit is always set with an abundance of caution. The retread process is easy to understand. A worn tyre is removed from an aircraft. It is sent back to a retreading firm, often a manufacturer of airplane tires. When the firm receives a tire for retreading it is carefully inspected to ensure that it is safe and economical to retread. The tyre is scrapped if technicians consider there to be doubt about its airworthiness.",

There are numerous ways in which this is done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft.

Such system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-revisable operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through a mechanical linkage. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released (unlocked), either either by mechanic or electronic means. This allows the gears to free-fall under their own weight. The weight of the gears will push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position by mechanical means.",

A skid not corrected can quickly lead to a tire blowout, possible damage to the aircraft, and control of the aircraft may be lost. One of the important issues to realize is that the anti-skid system greatly increases the effectiveness of braking. In very simplified terms, the anti-skid system provides the greatest possible brake pressure while not allowing the wheels to lock due to an excessive brake pressure being applied. Without the anti-skid system (manual braking) the braking effectiveness is reduced. \"The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed to provide a slip ratio for maximum braking performance.\" Correct. These systems use a computer that, during ground movement when braking, which constantly compares the measured values of individual wheels (actual rotational speed) with the desired optimum parameters, providing a slip ratio for maximum braking performance. \"If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will be able to achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with anti-skid.\" Incorrect. A pilot will never reach the same performance as a properly functioning anti-skid system. The anti-skid system senses when a brake starts to skid and will reduce braking pressure to avoid the wheels from skidding, a pilot won’t come close to the same performance.",

            "explanation": "“When using manual braking during taxiing, the auto-brake system will disarm.” INCORRECT. During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides a constant deceleration during landing on a dry runway. (ignoring possible transition effects when the system begins to function)” CORRECT. The autobrake system varies the brake pressure to achieve a deceleration rate (about 1.7 m/sec2 on the A320 in low autobrake mode). So, when you select “low” autobrake mode in flight, on the landing roll out – it varies the brake pressure to achieve that deceleration rate always. If it is a contaminated runway and it can’t achieve that rate, fundamentally, it will just achieve what it can achieve. “When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed, because maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in the RTO mode.” INCORRECT. I would say that this is a bit type specific. However, saying that the maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in RTO IS NOT CORRECT. => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. The same amount of pressure is accomplished, the only benefit of autobrake is that the braking happens immediately, you do not have to wait for a pilot to respond to it. And, therefore, the braking distance without an autobrake is longer => because of the reaction time. BOTTOM LINE: same deceleration is accomplished, stopping distance in manual braking is greater due to the reaction time.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main hydraulic system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. This is common for large aircraft as their gear are very heavy. Unfortunately, in light aircraft, the gear components are not as heavy, so can get jammed in place with not very much force. This includes the \"blowdown\" system using compressed gasses. The action of emergency gear extension is often a one-way movement, and cannot be reversed. In order to activate the system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through one of the following systems. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. Some emergency extension systems (as mentioned above) use bottles of compressed air or compressed nitrogen to extend the gear, thereby overcoming any small jams that would otherwise keep the gear in the up position. Nitrogen is better as it is non-flammable, and air contains oxygen, which will feed a potential fire. Compressed air is easier (and cheaper) to bottle though. The gear will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical down locks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. The shuttle valve mentioned in this question is a way to feed one actuator with two different pressure sources. When one pressure source loses pressure, the piston can slide across from blocking the emergency source to blocking the usual source, allowing out the emergency pressure to feed the actuator. This can be automatic or manually controlled. A diagram of the shuttle valve is shown in the annex above.",

Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance.",

Autobrake For normal operation of the autobrake system, select a deceleration setting. Settings include: MAX - Used when minimum stopping distance is required. Deceleration rate is less than that produced by full manual braking on a dry runway 3 or 4 - Should be used for wet or slippery runways or when landing rollout distance is limited 1 or 2 - These settings provide a moderate deceleration effect suitable for all routine (i.e., not slippery or contaminated runway) operations On a slippery runway the autobrake deceleration rate of 3, 4, although selectable, may not be achievable.

The chosen level affects the deceleration rate, resulting in a longer or shorter landing distance. After touchdown, the autobrake will begin braking as soon as the throttle is moved to idle and the wheels start spinning. By utilizing reverse thrust and a low autobrake setting, the brake temperature can be reduced. The use of thrust reversers can help reduce the brake cooling time by reducing the amount of braking required to slow down the aircraft during landing. By using thrust reversers, the engines can be used to help slow the aircraft down, thereby reducing the amount of braking required from the brakes.",

Statement 2: During landing auto-brakes keep operating when idle reverse thrust is selected. Correct, as you can see in the description below, idle reverse thrust will not disable auto-braking. Basic auto-brake information below, which states that the auto-brake system is only disarmed by Pilot action. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. The sidewall is the bit on the side of the tyre that connects the tread to the \"bead\", which is fitted to the wheel rim, it is a very vulnerable section of the tyre, with less protection. Objects embedded in the tyre cause obvious damage to the structural integrity, which could lead to blow outs or slow punctures, both of which are very bad for any ground movements, take off and landing. Note: We are well aware that the pilot should check for both embedded objects and tyre creep when performing their walk around, so would be inclined to appeal this question if it came up in this format. We believe that embedded items are worse than tyre creep, but they should certainly both be checked.

            "explanation": "Important Note: This question is slightly modified from the original feedback received. The original feedback did not compare the multi-disk steel brakes to anything, so was very difficult to answer as the options require comparison to other brakes, however, it was clear from the options that sometimes the examiner was asking about the multi-disk vs single disk element, and sometimes about steel brakes vs carbon brakes. Therefore, We chose to compare them to single disc carbon brakes. The only difference in answer can occur if they compare multi-disc steel brakes to multi-disc carbon brakes directly, in which case the carbon brakes have higher braking strength usually. Please let us know what was actually on the exam if you do see this, and we can adjust it as necessary, thanks! The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them many times, but softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible, and because their wear is more linked to amount of applications, rather than total heat input. In most transport aircraft, the brakes need to absorb vast amounts of heat during landings, rejected take-offs and taxiing, much more than could be absorbed by a single disk and pair of brake pads. Therefore, their brakes are usually made up of multiple (spinning) brake discs separated by multiple (static) rings of brake pads. These multiple rings of stators and rotors can provide much stronger braking and absorb far more heat than a single disc and pair of pads alone, steel or carbon.",

Statement 2: when reverse thrust is activated. Incorrect, the autobrake remains active also when reverse thrust is activated.

There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Please let us know if you see either in the exam, and whatever you can remember about them, thank you! FLY-BY-WIRE In a Fly-By-Wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, moving the flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which significantly enhances safety. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft can change the effect of control inputs to make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. For instance, in the Airbus A320, above 33°, force is needed to maintain the bank angle. The aircraft will not allow bank angles past 67° in normal law. In this question the bank angle protections have activated improperly at 30° AoB, so more force will be required to maintain or increase the angle of bank.",

            "explanation": "As a fully manual flight control system is reversible the pilot feels all forces acting on the control surfaces in the controls. So the pilot must be able to exert sufficient force to overcome the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Normal law is the system mode which is active throughout the flight and is terminated when system failures occur that prevent its use. The highest reduced mode of operation in Airbus FBW systems is the Alternate Law, which provides most features of normal law. Some features such as automatic stall protection are lost and replaced by conventional warnings for the pilots to manually correct the condition. This means that flight envelope protection is degraded as avionics no longer limit the pilot input to avoid stall. Should failure conditions prevent operation in Alternate Law, an even more basic Direct Law is available. Autopilot functions are lost, along with flight envelope protection. As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power. As we have stated above, a system degradation results in a loss of protection features, so the required alertness of the crew increases and leads to a higher workload.",

This computer’s output will be the input for an electrically controlled hydro-mechanical unit, a hydraulic motor, which drive the transmission which moves the flaps. The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting.

Thankfully, this topic is not particularly complicated so the more questions about this, the better. In a fly-by-wire system such as the Airbus A320, amongst others, both pilots have a sidestick which is a major input into the fly-by-wire control system. As these sidesticks are not mechanically linked like other, there needs to be a way for both pilots to make inputs at once. The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own priority button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

            "explanation": "Fly-By-Wire systems A Fly-By-Wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of a late go-around like this one, the recommended way to go around remains the same amongst all aircraft, apply TOGA thrust (or sometimes less if full TOGA thrust is not required), pitch up to a suitable go-around attitude (somewhere around 15° initially), retract flaps if necessary, and begin climbing, then \"clean up\" the rest of the aircraft (gain speed, gear up, retract flaps further, etc.). For that initial reaction though, Fly-By-Wire flight envelope protections could perhaps be useful. Because of the stall protection of a fly-by-wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply TO/GA thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will likely go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), so the aircraft will climb, but the system will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: This would be a very aggressive manoeuvre, and similar to terrain or windshear escape manoeuvres, which would cause the pilots far more issues later on than if they just performed a normal go-around, so this is not the way a pilot should actually fly a go-around in a fly-by-wire aircraft, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing Fly-By-Wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems. Whilst pulling back on the stick with caution is quite advisable (as per one of the other options), it does not need to be gentle, particularly for a late go-around, and it is not to stop the aircraft stalling really, as the Fly-By-Wire stops that.",

These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer would could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional computers and hydraulic systems.",

Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed inscreases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder peddals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system reduces the rudder deflection for a given rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Incorrect. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted.",

Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "\"I. A gust lock can be used in flight to reduce the effects of turbulence.\" Incorrect. A gust lock is essentially a device which limits the movement of a control surface while the aeroplane is parked, preventing damage when it is unattended. It stops aicraft's surfaces from being slammed back and forth in a strong wind/gusts. Typically it is the ailerons, the elevator and the rudder that are of concern. In many aircraft, the control column that supports the yoke can be immobilized in the cockpit with a heavy pin that slides through aligned holes in the column itself, thereby restarting the elevator and ailerons from moving at all. There is also a style of gust lock that attaches directly to the base of the rudder and holds it immobile. It is clearly essential that all flight control locks are removed/disengaged before flight. \"II. Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock.\" Correct. A reversible control system is a power assisted system in which the pilot is connected directly to the controls, feeling part of the load. It is called \"reversible\" because if someone moves the external surfaces, the stick (or control column) and the peddals move inside the cockpit. Control surfaces move freely and in case of strong wind, for example, they may be slammed back and forth, which may cause aircraft damage. For that reason, a gust lock system should be used, inside the aircraft and/or outside.",

Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. This means that flap asymmetry will roll the aircraft towards the cleaner wing (fewer flaps), as the wing with flaps down is producing much more lift than it. It also means that the aircraft will have asymmetric drag, and will want to yaw towards the wing with flaps down, as the flaps are causing extra drag that the clean wing is not producing.

As far as we can tell from the slightly ambiguous wording of this question (and guessing about the exact aircraft in question), this is what EASA are asking about, and they want us to know that there is a second hydraulic \"servojack\" (as Airbus calls it) for each aileron in case of this kind of failure. This is to allow for redundancy in the system, and no \"one point of failure\".

Flight envelope protection is what is being discussed in this question. An aircraft with fly-by-wire operating in normal law will have a full suite of stall protections. These mean that the system will not let the pilot stall the aircraft by pulling back too hard or too far with the sidestick. It also protects the aircraft from pulling more than the limit load factor. This means that during a terrain escape manoeuvre, when the aim is to gain as much altitude as possible in the shortest distance, the pilot can just pull back on the sidestick to full deflection, and the fly-by-wire system will ensure a controlled pitch up to a high (but safe) pitch angle, allowing the speed to reduce to the point where the aircraft reaches \"max alpha\", and then the aircraft will pitch down to maintain that angle of attack. Whether this is an approved way of performing a terrain escape manoeuvre is irrelevant to the question, which is simply testing your technical knowledge of fly-by-wire systems.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer.",

Secondary flight controls such as flaps, slats, and spoilers often contain maximum speed limits for their use, due to the fact that they stick into the airflow, which will exert significant force on them due to dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure exerted is proportional to the square of the air velocity, so for a doubling of speed, the dynamic pressure increases by x4. If the secondary flight controls were extended past their maximum speed, the devices and the mechanisms keeping them in place could be overpowered or may be permanently damaged. For spoilers, they are subject to huge amounts of dynamic pressure as part of their job \"spoiling\" the airflow over the wing, so are particularly susceptible to this. Note: The spoilers/speedbrakes on an aircraft wing are usually secondary flight controls, but when roll spoilers are active, the roll spoilers are actually classed as primary flight controls because they are acting as ailerons.",

A full stabilizer deflection could prevent the aircraft from returning to a safe landing. A Runaway Pitch Trim can be fatal in flight because it would run the horizontal stabilizer either up or down to its mechanical stops, and the use of the elevators would not be sufficient to overcome this force. In most Electrical Trim systems, two toggle switches are required for a stabilizer trim system, where one of them releases the trim brake and the other one drives the motor. You must use both to activate the stabilizer trim - they are designed in such a way on the control column that if you trim, you will always push them together. The reason you need double trim switches is primarily to prevent Trim Runaway on the stabilizer, if one switch runs away then the other can be used to stop it.",

Modern transport aircraft must be equipped with safeguards to prevent loss of control in the event of hydraulic or electrical failure. This is typically achieved by incorporating redundancy into the control system. One common method of redundancy is splitting control surfaces into two or three sections, each powered by separate actuators and hydraulic systems. In addition, computer system redundancy is also provided in some modern transport aircraft, such as Airbus aircraft. In a large transport aircraft with fully powered primary flight controls, redundancy can be achieved by having multiple flight control computers linked to multiple actuators supplied by different power sources. This configuration ensures that, in the event of a single-point failure, the aircraft's control surfaces remain operable and the pilots can continue to control the aircraft safely.",

CORRECT: The zero force position will not change when using pitch (elevator) trim Statement 2: The zero force position of the control wheel does not change when using the aileron trim. INCORRECT: The zero force position will change when using the aileron trim. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This computer’s output will be the input for an electrically controlled hydro-mechanical unit, a hydraulic motor, which drive the transmission which moves the flaps. The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting. If the main hydraulic system fails, the emergency operation might be via an alternate hydraulic system or an electric motor which operates the same gear train as the normal operating system.",

At low speed, a nose down demand is introduced based on IAS (instead of AOA) and Alternate Law changes to Direct Law. In addition, an audio \"STALL\" warning is introduced. α-Floor protection is not available so conventional pilot stall recovery action is required. Load Factor and Bank Angle Protections are retained. High Speed and High Angle of Attack Protections enter Alternate Law mode. Pitch Attitude Protection is lost. ALT1 control law degradation will result from some faults in the horizontal stabilizer, a single elevator fault, loss of a yaw-damper actuator, loss of slat or flap position sensors or a single air data reference fault. Dependent upon the failure, autopilot may not be available. In Alternate Law 2 (ALT2), Normal Law lateral mode is lost and is replaced by roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch mode is in Alternate Law. Load factor protection is retained. In addition to those protections lost in ALT1 (Pitch Attitude and Low Energy Protection), Bank Angle Protection is also lost. In some failure cases, High Angle of Attack and High Speed Protections will also be lost. As is the case with ALT1, some failure cases that result in ALT2 will also cause the autopilot to disconnect. ALT2 is entered when both engines flame out, with faults in two inertial or two air-data reference units, with faults to all spoilers, certain aileron faults or with a pedal transducers fault Direct law In Direct Law (DIR), lateral modes are the same as ALT2; that is roll Direct Law and yaw Alternate Law. Pitch control degrades to Direct Law and automatic trim is inoperative requiring stab trim to be adjusted manually by the pilot. Control surface motion is directly related to the sidestick motion. ALL protections are lost. In Direct Law, autopilot function is always lost. DIR is entered if there is failure of all three inertial reference units or all three primary flight computers, faults in both elevators or flame out of both engines concurrent with loss of PRIM 1. Boeing uses: Normal mode In Normal mode during manual flight, the ACEs receive pilot control inputs and send these signals to the three PFCs. The PFCs verify these signals and utilise information from other airplane systems in order to compute control surface commands. These commands are then sent back to the ACEs which then send the enhanced signals to the flight control surface actuators which convert them into analog servo commands. Full functionality is provided including all enhanced performance, envelope protection and ride quality features. When the autopilot is engaged, the autopilot system sends commands to the PFCs. The PFCs generate control surface commands which are sent to the ACEs in the same manner as pilot control inputs. The autopilot commands move the flight deck controls to provide autopilot feedback to the pilots. If a pilot overrides the autopilot with control inputs, the PFCs will disengage the autopilot and utilise the pilot control inputs. Note that the autopilot is not available should reversion to Secondary or Direct mode occur. Secondary mode Boeing Secondary mode is somewhat similar to the Airbus Alternate Law. When the PFCs cannot support Normal mode operation due to internal faults or to loss of information from other aircraft systems, they automatically revert to Secondary mode. Reversion to Secondary mode results in the loss of the autopilot and the pilots must control the aircraft manually. The ACEs still receive pilot control inputs and send the appropriate signals to the PFCs. However, due to the degraded mode of operation, the PFCs use \"simplified\" computations to generate the flight control surface commands. These commands are sent back to the ACEs from where they are sent to the flight control surfaces in the same manner as during Normal mode operations. Aircraft handling qualities are affected by the simplified computations or PFC control laws that are utilised in Secondary mode. While all flight control surfaces remain operative, the elevator and rudder are more sensitive at some airspeeds. The following functions are inoperative or degraded during Secondary mode operations: autopilot auto speedbrakes envelope protection gust suppression tail strike protection thrust asymmetry compensation yaw damping Direct mode The ACEs automatically revert to Direct mode when they detect the failure of all three PFCs or when they are unable to communicate with the PFCs. Direct mode can also be manually selected by selecting the DISC position on the Primary Flight Computers Disconnect switch. In Direct mode, the PFCs no longer generate control surface commands. Pilot inputs are received by the ACEs and sent directly to the flight control surface actuators. Direct mode allows for full aircraft control while in flight and during the landing phase. Aircraft handling characteristics are very similar to those encountered while in Secondary mode. In addition to those functions lost during Secondary mode operations (as listed previously) the manual rudder trim cancel switch is inoperative.",

            "explanation": "Refer to the figure The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. In the figure in the annex you can see the schematic of a feel system. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Therefore, in a Fly-By-Wire system, the control surfaces are moved indirectly by the pilot inputs via a computer, which makes the system irreversible.

Advantages of Fly-By-Wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure G forces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer, which could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional sensors, computers and hydraulic systems. A flight control system must not be allowed to have a single point of failure, so there is a large amount of extra redundancy built-in, which allows multiple different failures before the FBW system becomes inoperative.",

Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination.

The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control).

CORRECT: If an aircraft would take off with a gust lock engaged one or more flight controls would not work. Statement 2: There is no need for a gust lock on reversible flight controls. INCORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed.

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with even a medium sized flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps/slats from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, which will hydraulically deflect a flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to FBW systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW also enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which, provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft has the ability to change the control inputs to keep the aircraft within its safe flight envelope, and can therefore make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. The system would not override the pilot too much, and in dire situations the pilot may require high bank angles, which would still be possible in a FBW aircraft, as not to degrade safety.",

            "explanation": "There are 4 main types of control system: Manual - cables and pulleys connect the flight controls to the control surfaces directly. The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-By-Wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

Priority takeover is added as the sidesticks are not mechanically linked so the pilots must be able to decide who is controlling the aircraft manually, as dual inputs can otherwise occur. to disconnect the autopilot when engaged in \"command\" (i.e. the aircraft is automatically flying), this red button can be pushed, the autopilot can be de-selected on the control panel (the flight-deck glareshield panel), or the pilot can simply make a large enough input on the sidestick, which will also disengage the autopilot and allow the pilot to control the aircraft manually.

CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: There is no need for a gust lock on a fully manual flight control system. INCORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Normal law is the system mode which is active throughout the flight and is terminated when system failures occur that prevent its use. The highest reduced mode of operation in Airbus FBW systems is the Alternate Law, which provides most features of normal law. Some features such as automatic stall protection are lost and replaced by conventional warnings for the pilots to manually correct the condition. Should failure conditions prevent operation in Alternate Law, an even more basic Direct Law is available. Autopilot functions are lost, along with flight envelope protection. As a last emergency means of operation, Mechanical Backup is provided to maintain level flight only for the limited period of flight control computer reset following a complete loss of power. As we have stated above, a system degradation results in a loss of protection features, so the required alertness of the crew increases and leads to a higher workload.",

They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and Fly-By-Wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals.

            "explanation": "As you can see at the bottom of this explanation, for the aileron and rudder the “zero force point” will be adjusted when trimming. This is not the case for elevator trim. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

A flap asymmetry situation can be disastrous. This is because flaps change the coefficient of lift of the wing massively, in order to provide more lift, and therefore allow flight at slower speeds. Flaps can easily double the coefficient of lift from a wing, whilst also increasing the drag, possibly by a lot. An aircraft will fly terribly with a large flap asymmetry, with high drag and high lift on one wing but not the other. A way to avoid this situation is by having a flap/slat asymmetry protection system. This detects the actual flap/slat position in each wing with great accuracy, and as soon as an asymmetry is detected, the system will stop the flaps from moving, and show up a warning or caution to the pilots.",

If one hydraulic system fails because of a leak, the other system can be used to maintain control. It might give less control than it would with both systems operating but the aircraft will be controllable and can be landed without problems. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control).

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are 3 ways to limit rudder deflection, which we want to do at higher airspeeds to limit the forces on the aircraft: Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Variable Stops: The movement of the rudder and the pedal travel are directly proportional to each other. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted. This does have the consequence of making the rudder very sensitive at high airspeeds, just not with a very long pedal travel. The figure above shows the allowed deflection of a particular aircraft. Blow-Back: This is a system that applies a constant movement force to the rudder, the force being dictated by the pedal deflection, which then deflects the rudder depending on the speed of the airflow. slower airspeed means that the constant force will deflect the rudder more, whereas fast airspeed would mean the consequent higher dynamic pressure naturally limits the rudder deflection, acting like a more modern rudder ratio changer. The reason that statement 2 is incorrect is that it says the limitations to rudder/rudder pedal deflection occur with decreasing airspeed, but actually it is with increasing airspeed.",

The A320 is a typical example of an aircraft with a FBW system in which all surfaces are actuated hydraulically and are electrically or mechanically controlled. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY (figure 2) Safeguards to eliminate the possibility of loss of control in the event of hydraulic or electrical failure must be provided on modern transport aircraft. This is generally achieved by building some form of redundancy into the control system. Splitting the control surfaces into two or three sections, each powered by separate actuators and hydraulic systems is the usual method. The A320 (EASA's usual favourite aircraft) has 2 actuators per aileron aswell, an active and a \"damping\", which can be used in the event of the failure of the active. Important Note: This question is far too ambiguous about the aircraft in question and the fault that has occured. We have to go to the level of the learning objectives, and try to see what the examiner wants from us. They want us to know that there are multiple computers for each system, so in this event, the system can switch computers, and redundancy in the rest of the system allows us to use a different actuator aswell. This is not true for all FBW aircraft, but going off the feedback, this is what EASA want from us.",

The processed commands are then transmitted to a servo valve, which, in turn, regulates the movement of a hydraulic actuator, ultimately controlling the aircraft's flight surfaces. FBW systems can be lighter than a conventional system as FBW does not require the heavy control cables. Including FBW provides a significant reduction in fuel consumption. The FBW systems also provide flight envelope protection by preventing the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack. It will also allow the pilot to operate the controls positively up to the 2.5g limit without fear of overstressing the aircraft.",

Fly-By-Wire flight controls offer many benefits to an aircraft, one of the largest being the addition of flight envelope protection. Provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, this significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, overspeed, high-AoA/low airspeed and bank angle. At high angles of attack/low airspeeds, sometimes called high alpha, Fly-By-Wire systems have certain protections to prevent the aircraft stalling. Take Airbus for instance, their aircraft have alpha prot., alpha floor, and alpha max. Each level increases the amount of protections, from automatically beginning a descent to remain at a safe speed (alpha prot.) all the way up to alpha max, which the pilots cannot physically exceed (whilst in normal law). These protections reduce pilot workload, by allowing the pilots to think about things other than flying the aircraft near the stall. This could allow the pilots to complete checks or drills and secure the situation.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Partially powered/Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-by-wire - A type of fully powered control system where the flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted (partially powered) control systems, which are \"reversible\", and have natural feedback to the flight controls. Power assisted controls do not have as much feedback as manual controls of course, as the hydraulic system takes most of the force, but the pilot will feel a certain percentage of it, and the feel force does come from the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the control surface.",

            "explanation": "A fully manual flight control system would be a reversible control system, meaning the forces applied on the controls are the forces moving the control surfaces and vice versa. This are connected by mechanical links only and aren’t powered in any way. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

They may be used to give directional control together, or instead of the ailerons. When a flight spoiler is raised it disturbs the flow over the wing causing a decrease in lift. When the flight spoilers are used for lateral control, on the wing that is meant to go down, the spoilers will extend while the spoilers on the up going wing remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers will not increase lift and so the use of spoilers instead of ailerons will cause a decrease in lift, this however will give some advantages over ailerons. As the raised spoiler will increase drag, the yaw directions will be in the same direction as the roll, therefore there will be no adverse yaw. When flying at transonic speeds there will be no shock induced, so the effectiveness stays the same. Because the spoilers are not located at the end of the wings there will be less wing twisting because the loss of lift will be distributed more even across the wingchord. Flight spoilers can also be used as speedbrakes, these can be used either in the air or on the ground. When on the ground the spoilers will be extended further than when in the air. When spoilers are used as speedbrakes their deflection will be symmetrical other than for lateral control when the deflection will be asymmetrical.",

The position of the flaps is measured with sensors and is indicated in the cockpit. The flaps are protected against asymmetric operation, runaway and over speed. The flap load relief system, or load limiter will retract the flaps to an intermediate position when the airspeed exceeds a predetermined speed. Once the speed has decreased below this speed, the flaps will be automatically returned to the selected flap setting. If the main hydraulic system fails, the emergency operation might be via an alternate hydraulic system or an electric motor which operates the same gear train as the normal operating system.",

The standard system for this is for both inputs to be \"algebraically summed\" together, which is a complex way of saying that both sticks get an input into the control system. This is called dual input. In case that it occurs, an aural warning “DUAL INPUT” and a flashing warning light in sight of each pilot is provided. To allow one pilot to take over controls from the other, which might be necessary in case of incapacitation, etc., a red take-over button is installed on each sidestick that disables the stick on the other side when held. This button works as an autopilot disconnect when pushed once, but when it is pushed and held, it removes the other pilot's inputs from the system, and after 40 seconds of holding (A320 specific) the other pilot is \"locked out\" from inputs until they push their own prioirty button. When this condition occurs, an aural warning is provided “PRIORITY LEFT/RIGHT”, indicating the active sidestick.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Statement 1: There is no need for a gust lock on irreversible flight controls. CORRECT: as in irreversible flight controls the control surfaces are attached to hydraulic actuators which will not move when an external force is exerted on the control surface. Statement 2: A fully manual flight control system should have a gust lock. CORRECT: fully manual flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

This is the system in operation during normal flights. Normal Law operates in different modes depending on the stage of flight. These modes include: Ground Mode Flight Mode Flare Mode Alternate Law offers limited protection including stability, load factor and stall protections. Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft. Note: Type related questions are out of the scope of ATPL learning objectives.

            "explanation": "On some aeroplanes, take-off is prevented with a gust lock engaged. This is the correct answer and to reply to the comments, some aircraft have gust locks in place which prevent the movement of the throttle. So this is what’s meant with take-off is prevented. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed inscreases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder peddals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. If this automatic reduction is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, it will may cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw. \"II. A variable stop system limits both rudder and rudder pedal deflection as the IAS increases.\" Correct. Variable Stop System: The movement of the rudder and pedal travel are proportional. However, as the airspeed increases, the movement of the rudder pedals and the rudder are physically reduced. When the rudder is limited in movement at high speed, the pedal travel is also restricted.",

This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (the same as powered steering in a car). The connecting factor means that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. Irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against and the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. Therefore, in this scenario, there is no connection at all between the control surfaces and the cockpit controls (especially as the aircraft is powered down, so there is no automatic control centring, etc.). Therefore, if the rudder goes to full deflection by the wind or by someone pushing it, etc., there would be no corresponding movement of the rudder pedals. That would be the case for any irreversible control system, but the rudder pedals would also move if the system were reversible. Therefore, the flight controls on the aircraft described must be fully powered, out of that selection of options.",

Basically, it is the reduced mode of operation which provides most features of normal law. Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft. Note: Type related questions are out of the scope of ATPL learning objectives.

These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. Advantages of Fly-By-Wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft.

Each flap setting has a VFE speed, which is the maximum flaps extended speed. Above this speed, the flaps will take too much load, and could be damaged. Modern jet transport aircraft often have a flap load relief system, which detects flap overspeed, and can disengage the flap lock, allowing the airflow to push the flaps to a lower setting, or some intermediate value, so that the flaps do not get damaged. Some systems use hydraulic pressure and physically move the flaps using the standard system, whereas others use the \"blowback\" system mentioned above.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.05.05: Explain the concept of a rudder deflection limitation (rudder limiter) system and the various means of implementation (rudder ratio changer, variable stops, blow-back). One of the problems with rudders is that they need to be very large and have a large maximum deflection for adequate directional control in the case of an engine failure during take-off or at low speeds, when there is very little airflow, but if this large rudder had a large deflection at the high cruise speeds of a jet aircraft, it could easily break the tail of the aircraft off with the extreme forces. There are a few methods to remove this problem, rudder ratio changers, variable stops, and blow-back. Rudder Ratio Changer: The control commands from the rudder pedals and trim control are modified by a rudder ratio changer. As the aircraft speed increases, the rudder deflection must be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot => the rudder pedals move through their full range at all speeds, however, rudder deflection is reduced with increasing airspeed. This rudder ratio changer can be continuous, as described above, or can be a discreet change at a certain airspeed, like changing gears in a car. If this automatic reduction in rudder authority is not applied and rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high speed flight, the huge forces could damage the aircraft, or at least cause violent yaw/roll. Conversely, if the rudder remains in the high-speed, low deflection mode, then there will be insufficient rudder authority to handle engine failures and crosswind landings at low speeds. This means that the approach will have added limitations, such as a higher minimum approach speed and a reduced crosswind limit. The annex above is an extract from the ATR 72 FCOM, an aircraft which does have a discreet rudder ratio changer (called a TLU - Travel Limiting Unit - in the manual) that changes rudder deflection at 180 kts, and the procedure for if a fault occurs. Notice that within the area of the red box, the procedure for if the fault is not resolved (or unsure if resolved) is to increase the VAPP (approach speed) by 10 kt (with associated increased landing distance) and land at an airport with the lowest crosswind, max demonstrated crosswind is 15 kt. To address the other options: The maximum operating speed will not increase, only the minimum. The rudder authority will be less than usual. The flap setting would not need to be greater, as the approach will be faster, so if anything, less flaps may be needed.",

But here we go, statement 1 is definitely incorrect: \"1) disengage FBW.\" INCORRECT. FBW describes those flight control systems which use computers to process the flight control inputs made by the pilot or autopilot, and send corresponding electrical signals to the flight control surface actuators. It is definitely not possible to disengage the FBW. \"2) press and hold priority button.\" CORRECT. The sidestick priority logic is only valid when the autopilot is disconnected as it manages who has control when sidestick inputs are made on both sidesticks at the same time. If you press that button at any time it disconnects the autopilot. Press and hold it you have priority. Computers will disregard the other sidestick’s inputs. Press it continuously for 40 secs and it permanently locks the other sidestick out unless the other pilot presses his button. \"3) disengage on MCP.\" CORRECT. I believe they might be referring to the A/P disengage bar which is found on the MCP of Boeing airplanes. If you press this bar down, the A/P disengages. \"4) forcefully move the control column.\" CORRECT.

            "explanation": "Flight controls Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. In the figure in the annex you can see how the trim of the artificial feel unit works. A movement of the trim wheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "As you can see at the bottom of this explanation, for the aileron and rudder the “zero force point” will be adjusted when trimming. This is not the case for elevator trim. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does.

They are usually used while landing or performing manoeuvres which take the aircraft close to the stall, but are usually retracted in normal flight to minimize drag. They decrease stall speed. Some aircraft have an autoslat function which will extend the slats automatically if the wing is about to stall. Usually this autoslat function has some conditions before it will function which can be airspeed, flaps and slats settings. When the stall condition ceases the autoslat system will retract the slats. With an autoslat system the aircraft has improved stall characteristics as with high angles of attack the stall speed is reduced.",

When using the elevator (pitch) trim, the entire horizontal tail moves and therefore the zero force point will stay the same. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. The artificial feel system is placed in parallel with the hydraulic actuator, so the movement of the flight controls in the cockpit will cause the hydraulic actuator to operate. During this same movement the artificial feel system will apply pressure on the controls appropriate to the airspeed of the aircraft. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

            "explanation": "Note: We think that the different authorities have different versions of this question. Some mention that it is a Fly By Wire aircraft, some saying Airbus, and some saying specifically A320. It is the same answer for all these, and EASA are usually talking about A320s when they mention Fly By Wire anyway. We think the questions are similar enough to warrant only this one in the bank, but if further feedback says otherwise, we will add separate questions. Fly By Wire systems A fly by wire control system is a powered system (irreversible) that uses electronic inputs to a solenoid servo valve instead of mechanical inputs from conventional powered controls. The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of Fly By Wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. This question used to be very ambiguous, but over the past year it has changed a few times, and now we know it is an Airbus (we believe it says A320 in some exam authorities) and it is flying at the critical angle of attack. As it is at its critical angle of attack, pulling back on the sidestick would make it initially attempt to climb, but as this would further increase the angle of attack and slow the aircraft, the flight envelope protections would step in and stop this pitching backwards. Therefore the only thing that can save us from this scenario is actually adding thrust. This will allow us to increase our speed, decreasing our AoA, and subsequently, the flight controls will allow us to begin a climb. This is the only way to induce any sort of climb from the very low energy state of the question. In fact, the Airbus A320 actually has a set of limiting angles of attack, where different measures will be taken one by one to stop an impending stall. One of those measures is automatically applying TO/GA (Take off/Go around) thrust. You are not expected to know this for the question, so do not assume that the aircraft will automatically do this if you keep pulling back. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.05.01.03.05: Explain the operating principle of rudder and aileron trim in a fully powered control system. There are two basic types of flight controls, reversible and irreversible. Reversible flight controls are those that have a two way force mechanism naturally as part of the system. This includes manual flight controls, which use levers and pulleys to transfer pilot force to the controls, and partially powered controls, which are aided by hydraulic force, but there is still a mechanical connection between the pilot and controls (think powered steering in a car). The connecting factor is that if you went to the aileron and pushed it, the controls in the cockpit would move accordingly. The opposite are irreversible controls, which have no \"backwards force\", or \"feel\". These are only 1 way, so the pilot can move the control surfaces, but the control surfaces cannot move the pilot's controls. Fully powered hydraulic controls and fly-by-wire controls are irreversible. irreversible controls have no natural feedback, so require artificial \"feel\", so the pilot has something to push against, the controls naturally centre, etc. If you pushed the aileron, the controls would not move. There are pros and cons to both, but one benefit of irreversible controls such as fly by wire, is that trimming can be made easier. All a simple trim system needs to do is adjust where the system considers the \"zero\" point to be. Therefore the rudder (in this case) will sit naturally at the new \"zero\" point, which will produce a constant trim in a particular direction. Pitch trim can differ from this method though, and some manufacturers take their own stance on trimming, such as if the rudder pedals are supposed to move with the trim or not, etc.",

The pilot operates the controls, these can be a sidestick and rudder pedals or a conventional yoke with rudder pedals. These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. One of the largest benefits of fly by wire is the flight envelope protection system. It has many abilities, including preventing excessive bank angles, preventing the stall, overspeed protection, overload protection, etc. In the event of severe windshear, the recommended way to gain altitude and escape the windshear is to apply maximum thrust and pitch up to a high attitude until reaching near the stall speed, then maintain that speed. In theory, a Fly-By-Wire aircraft can actually perform some of that for the pilot. Because of the stall protection of a Fly-By-Wire flight control system, in theory, the pilot can just apply full thrust and pull back on the sidestick all the way, and just hold it there. The aircraft will go into stall protection mode, which in an Airbus A320 (as EASA usually refer to) changes the control logic slightly above αprot then applies TO/GA thrust above αfloor (the pilot should already have applied TO/GA at this point of course), but will not let the aircraft fully stall, no matter how hard the pilot pulls back. Note: this is not the way an Airbus pilot should actually fly a windshear escape manoeuvre, it is simply a theoretical method of doing so. However, the examiner likes to find interesting ways of testing fly-by-wire knowledge, and that includes asking you about the very limits of the systems.",

CORRECT: If an aircraft would take off with a gust lock engaged one or more flight controls would not work. Statement 2: Reversible flight controls should have a gust lock. CORRECT: reversible flight controls will move by external or internal forces and are not held in place by anything, so strong winds could cause damage to the aircraft. A gust lock or control lock, is an internal or external lock and may be fitted to the control surface or the cockpit control. These locks are made for when an aircraft is parked outside with strong or gusty winds these could move the control surfaces against their stops which could cause damage. If these are fitted to the cockpit control they might be made in a way that it is impossible to move the throttle until the control locks are removed. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",

As Fly-By-Wire control systems have no manual back-up systems, and flight controls can be lost due to loss of power, loss of computers, loss of hydraulics, etc., they have multiple redundant systems to prevent this. In reality, they end up having more redundancy than some simpler systems, in the amount of separate systems that can be used as backups. For this question then, the correct answer is actually that FBW aircraft benefit from increased damage tolerance. Now we strongly believe that it very much depends on the type of damage and its location, but when you consider that FBW aircraft usually have 3 hydraulic systems and 3-4 flight control computers, you can see where the examiner is coming from.

Slats Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed-wing aircraft which, when deployed, allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack. At high angles of attack they allow the air over the wing to have much greater energy, allowing the aircraft to fly at much higher angles of attack without stalling. This allows the wing to produce a higher maximum coefficient of lift, and can therefore fly slower whilst still balancing the weight force with lift. Slats, like flaps, are therefore used for take-off, landing and slow flight, thereby reducing take-off and landing distances. Slats are still retracted for normal flight as they increase drag, similar to flaps. They are hydraulically powered, just like the flaps and other flight controls on large aircraft. Some aircrafts are equipped with an Auto-Slat System. This system enhances the airplane stalling characteristics. Upon receiving a signal from the stall warning system that the aircraft is close to the stall (high AoA), the auto-slat system automatically operates the slats, extending them from the midrange position to the fully extended landing position. The slats retract a few seconds after the signal is removed. This is a bit like a \"get out of jail free\" card, and allows a few extra degrees angle of attack before the wing completely stalls.",

Means of control The pressurization can be controlled either automatically or manually. When the system is set to automatic, the system uses the pressure controllers which in most commercial aircraft are electronic. When the cabin pressure changes the controller sends a signal to the outflow valves whether to open or close. These valves are then positioned to a position to achieve a selected rate of pressure increase or decrease. Some aircraft have a ditching mode which will close all valves to avoid water flowing into the cabin in the event of a forced landing on water. The outflow valves are fitted with two AC motors, these are used with automatic control, and one DC motor for manual or emergency operation. When the pressure is controlled manually all automatic functions will be disabled and enables the outflow valves to be positioned with the DC motor. So manual mode has a separate circuit for the operation.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

This mass of air is kept constant by the mass flow controller. The pressure is regulated by the amount of air which is discharged back to the atmosphere by the outflow valves. So the more open these valves are, the lower the pressure will be in the aircraft. There must be two safety measures in place with these kind of systems to avoid a too high pressure or too low when the outside pressure is higher than that of the cabin. Safety valve This is a mechanical pressure relief valve which should open when the cabin exceeds the maximum pressure differential to which the aircraft is designed. Inward relief valve This valve works the other way around than the safety valve and will open once the pressure outside of the aircraft is higher so there will be no negative pressure differential. These two valves may be combined in the same unit or may be two separate units, but there must be at least two of each installed.",

            "explanation": "Most jet aircraft have pneumatic systems with 2 separate air conditioning packs. These usually use bleed air that has been taken from that side engine's compressor, thereby having a left pack which runs from left engine bleed air, and a right pack which runs off air from the right hand engine(s). The APU also feeds bleed air into the pneumatic system (usually to the left side). In the air, the system should operate normally with no interaction between the left and right side. There is an isolation valve between the two systems to either make them interconnected or completely separate. This is usually open on the ground when the engines are off to provide APU bleed air to both packs for cooling and to both engines for starting. It is closed in the air for split operation, unless an abnormal situation occurs, such as a loss of engine bleed air, pack failure, etc., when the isolation valve will either automatically be opened or the flight crew will open it to balance the load within the system. A significant pressure difference between the two sides of an isolation valve in the air is likely to mean that one of the sides has an issue that the other does not have. In the case of the Boeing 737 specifically (image shown above), the isolation valve opens automatically if any of the pack or engine bleed switches are NOT in their normal locations (bleeds on, packs auto) as the system knows that the pneumatics will become unbalanced in that case (bleed off, pack off, or pack set to high flow, etc.). It can be manually forced open or closed though by positioning the switch each side of the \"AUTO\" position. It is not good to feed bleed air into a leaky duct, though, so that is something to be careful of with pressure differentials. As for the other options: \"They close when the system pressure equals the environmental pressure.\" This is talking roughly about the pressurisation outflow valve. That is what controls the pressure in the cabin. \"They open when there is a leak in one of the systems.\" This is a bad thing, as we do not want to feed hot bleed air into a leaky air duct, due to overheating and potential loss of pressurisation. \"They close when the engines are at maximum thrust.\" Engines at high thrust produce more bleed air, but they will produce it to both sides of the pneumatic manifold, so isolation valve open or closed, it shouldn't make too much difference.",

The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Reduced fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no guidance on whether the initial cost of the electric-pneumatic system is cheaper than similar bleed air systems, and any engine system that reduced the take off distance would increase (not reduce) the climb gradient. The change in de-icing capabilities depends on the system. Ease of use also depends on the system. Bleed air pneumatic systems are quite easy to use so the difference will be minimal if there is one.",

            "explanation": "PRESSURIZATION SYSTEMS The aim of a cabin pressurization system is to maintain the cabin altitude at an optimum pressure, irrespective of the height at which the aircraft is flying. For aircraft with passenger cabins, the maximum cabin altitude of an aircraft must be limited to between 6000 and 8000 ft. At this altitude, the air will provide sufficient oxygen for normal use. Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 an 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude.",

The air in the pneumatic system is usually fed from a \"bleed air source\" in a gas turbine engine, which is effectively just air that has already gone through some of the compressor stages and is siphoned off to pressurise the system (not burnt). It is then distributed through pipes to the various parts of the aircraft where it is needed, such as the air conditioning packs or the leading edges of the wings and tailplane for de/anti-icing. The bleed air is very hot (a temperature of 400°C is sometimes quoted, for context) and so any leaks of these pipes could be harmful to the passengers or the other aircraft equipment. This is why there are often a few sensors throughout the aircraft, placed near to the pneumatic pipes, which detect an overheat and inform the flight crew of a likely leak. Note: The correct answer here seems remarkably easy, but it is direct from the feedback wording. We think other similar correct options could be a bleed leak sensor, duct overheat sensor, body overheat sensor, or something of that manner. Certainly read all the options in the exam to make sure none are possible (the bleed air pressure and temperature would NOT rise, and the oil temperature has no connection at all).",

Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Improved range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There are no significant control differences between two systems, a similar control panel is used and they have similar anti-icing/de-icing capabilities.

It makes use of engine bleed air or APU pneumatic air during the conditioning process. Another system is electrically powered air conditioning which can be found in Boeing 787. Some advantages of electrically driven air conditioning system: Improved fuel consumption due to a more efficient secondary power extraction, transfer, and usage. Reduced maintenance costs due to elimination of the maintenance-intensive bleed system. Improved reliability due to the use of modern power electronics and fewer components in the engine installation. Expanded range and reduced fuel consumption due to lower overall weight. There is no significant control differences between two systems, similar control panel is used and de-icing capabilities. An electrically driven air conditioning system does not increase take off distance.",

It differs from the other systems in that the cooling of the charge air is mainly achieved by a refrigerant. \"Air from the turbine of the turbocharger\" is incorrect because the air from the turbine is already highly compressed and hot, which makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose. \"Ram air and an electric fan\" is incorrect as the vapor-cycle system does not operate using ram air or an electric fan for its cooling process. \"A vapour-cycle machine is a closed system, therefore a separate air source is not required.\" is incorrect because a vapor-cycle system necessitates an external source of high-pressure and high-temperature air to facilitate the cooling of the refrigerant and other components.

Cabin Differential Pressure. Cabin pressure - ambient air pressure The difference in pressure between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure (the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft). Flying an aircraft at high altitude, with the cabin pressure set to a lower altitude, results in a pressure difference acting on the structure of the aircraft fuselage (hoop stresses). The maximum permissible cabin differential pressure for a transport aircraft is generally between 7 and 9 psi, however it may vary based on the fuselage design strength, and will limit the aircraft’s operational ceiling and its associated maximum cabin altitude. Control. Achieved by feeding air into the cabin (through air conditioning packs) and restricting its flow out - by using electric motor-operated outflow valves. The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control. If a higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the outflow is reduced by closing the outflow valves (which increases the pressure); To reduce cabin pressure, the outflow valve slowly opens, allowing more air to escape.",

A bootstrap system is based on a compressor driven by a turbine which is in turn driven by the charge air. In a bootstrap air cycle machine air is tapped from the low pressure compressor of the engine. This air is then precooled by the primary heat exchanger after which it will pass through the compressor. This will increase pressure and temperature, increasing the pressure will make the energy conversion later in the turbine more efficient. After the compressor the air passes through the secondary heat exchanger to remove the excess heat caused by the compressor. The main temperature reduction is achieved in the heat exchangers. The goal of this system is to be able to use air from only the low pressure compressor. With the compressor in place there will be a sufficiently high pressure drop through the turbine.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.06.01.01.01: Describe the following means of supplying air for the pneumatic systems for piston-engine aircraft: compressor; vacuum pump. In piston engine aircraft, different sources of air supply can be used, such as compressors, blowers or vacuum pumps. Those devices are driven by small electrical motors or directly by the engine and provide air for some instruments, de-icing and cabin. Compressors are able to handle more air while blowers and vacuum systems are used for lower demands. Ram air turbine may be used on larger aircraft as a backup hydraulic power source. Bleed air provides air supply for a gas turbine engine. Turbocharger is not necessarily running all the time and therefore would be of no use as air supply. Note: Superchargers can be used to provide pneumatic pressure, as they are effectively the same thing as an air compressor, just one that is usually used to provide extra Manifold Pressure to the engine intake air. This is why some textbooks and questions do refer to them as possible pneumatic pressure sources, but compressor pump is much more correct than turbocharger here, as turbochargers are not always working in an engine.",

Locate the value of 38 000 ft in the first column on the left => continue horizontally to the right and read the corresponding pressure 2.99 PSI. The maximum allowed pressure differential is 8.17 PSI - that means that the cabin pressure is \"outside air pressure (2.99) + differential pressure (8.17)= 11.16 PSI\" Cabin altitude corresponding to 11.16 psi is found by interpolating 7000-8000 ft and 11.34-10.92 PSI. For the 0.42 PSI change between 11.34 PSI (7000 ft) and 10.92 (8000 ft) PSI, the change in altitude is 1000 ft in total. So each 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft. We can calculate 11.16 PSI cabin pressure based on 11.34 PSI or 10.92 PSI. Let's base it on 11.34 PSI. The difference between this and the cabin pressure we calculated is 0.18 (11.34 - 11.16) PSI. Since every 0.01 PSI change causes a change in altitude of 23.81 ft, a change of 0.18 PSI causes an altitude change of 429 ft (23.81 x 18). If we add this value to our base altitude (7000 ft), the result is 7429 ft. (We added it because the altitude increases as the PSI decreases) The closest answer is 7430 ft.",

The valves are automatically controlled by the aircraft’s pressurization system when in automatic control.

Are used to prevent the over-pressurization of the aircraft cabin. They open at a preset differential pressure (when the maximum pressure differential allowed for the aircraft type is exceeded) and allow air to flow out of the cabin. Normally opens if the pressure rises to maximum differential plus 0.25 psi. Inwards relief valve/Negative Pressure Relief Valve. A relief valve in an aircraft pressurization system that prevents the pressure in the cabin from becoming lower than the ambient outside pressure, avoiding excessive negative differential pressure. Normally opens if the pressure outside the aircraft exceeds that inside the aircraft by 0.5 to 1.0 psi.",
