These generators’ characteristics are: 115/200 Volts, 3-phase AC. 400 Hz. 90 kVA. 28 V DC is obtained by converting the generators’ output AC via the transformer rectifier units. The APU generator is essentially the same as the main engine-driven generators, so it will provide exactly the same output. The APU will electrically supply the aircraft and other associated systems on the ground when the engines are not running, and the Ground Power unit (GPU) is not connected. As to why nowadays commercial aircraft generators are integrated with a CSD in an IDGU (integrated drive generator unit) and use mainly 400 Hz AC is because a higher frequency allows the manufacturers to make smaller and lighter generators that would allow increasing the payload instead of carrying extra weight from the generators. Because the frequency of an AC generator mainly relies on the number of pairs of poles and the speed of the rotor, it is sufficient to increase the generator’s rotational speed in order to provide a higher frequency, and thus decrease the generator’s size appropriately.",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”.

On top of assuring a equal potential difference, the bonding system can also be used as a earth return system for a unipole circuit. Incorrect answers: “eliminate the need for grounding the aircraft during refuelling.” – The wires create a connection between the aircraft parts, but not to the ground. “prevent the aircraft being struck by lightning.” – Even though the grounding system will help the electrons from the lighting pass through the aircraft, it will not prevent the aircraft from being hit by a lightning strike. “ensure the electrical potential of the aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.” – The bonding system ensures that the potential difference between the components is zero, not that the entire aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.",

In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the oil reservoir. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. We can now go through each option: \"A separate oil reservoir.\" Correct. A separate oil reservoir is part of a dry sump oil system. \"An oil filter with a bypass indicator.\" An oil filter will be in all types of engine oil system, due to the need to clean the oil and remove particulates before they are re-circulated through the engine. The bypass indicator shows clogging of the filter, and indicates when the filter is no longer being used, and the emergency bypass valve has opened to let oil past. \"An integrated oil reservoir.\" Wet sump oil systems use an integrated reservoir that stores the oil in the bottom of the engine casing. \"A pump to provide oil flow to the engine.\" Both types of oil system will include a pump to provide oil flow to the engine. In a wet sump system, it is the only oil pump. In a dry sump system, this is called the pressure pump (there is also a scavenge pump).",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than the exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

Any variations in engine power output (throttle pulled back or forward), which would otherwise produce a change in rpm, are sensed by the CSU which alters the propeller pitch angle to keep the rpm constant. If the throttle is pulled back, the propeller pitch would automatically decrease (fine pitch) but the RPM will remain the same, and vice-versa. The governor controls a hydraulic servo system feeding high-pressure oil, via a pilot valve, to a piston in the pitch change mechanism (PCM). The CSU operates on the principle of balancing a spring pressure against the centrifugal force of rotating governor flyweights, driven directly from the engine or reduction gearbox. Usually, in a piston engine, the governor flyweights are tensioned by a speeder spring, which is controlled from the cockpit by setting the RPM lever. In a turboprop, however, the most efficient engine RPM is maintained by pre-tensioning the speeder spring to give the maximum engine RPM at all times.",

However, if the grounding wire is broken, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply. Caution! Maintenance action should be sought before touching the propeller since the engine can start at any time with one magneto still un-grounded.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.10.09.04.03: Describe the operating principle of a variable pitch propeller when feathering and unfeathering, including the operation of cockpit controls. When flying with a variable pitch propeller (the most common type being a \"constant speed propeller\"), there is often an extra lever in the cockpit near the throttles to control the propeller pitch. In the standard \"constant speed propeller\" systems, this extra lever (coloured blue) sets the speed of the engine (the RPM), and the black throttle lever then dictates how much fuel and air mixture is allowed into the cylinders, which sets the manifold pressure. Having a constant speed propeller (variable pitch), means that the engine/propeller can run at their best RPM all the time, whether that be at 0 kt at the beginning of the take off roll or at 150 kt in the cruise, for instance. The incoming airflow at 150 kt means that the propeller must be set much more coarse to still cut out the same sized \"chunks of air\", thereby maintaining the correct angle of attack with the airflow. Fine pitch is when the chord of the propeller is more inline with the plane of rotation, and is more efficient for low speed flying, take-off, go arounds, etc. Coarse pitch is used in the cruise. Going past the coarse pitch until the propeller is pointing directly forwards (near 90° blade angle) is called feathering. It is used to reduce drag when the engine stops. If the engine stops with the propeller in the normal operating range, the airflow actually tries to turn the engine, which is what we call windmilling. This is what we need for restarting the engine, but it is not good for drag. Therefore, to \"unfeather\" an engine (to try a restart), we need to move the blade angle from feathered to fine (best for windmilling), which will initially provide negative thrust (drag), but as soon as the engine is turning under its own power, will be able to produce forwards thrust, which is not possible when feathered. The way to remember whether to push or pull the blue prop lever is to think of a go around/take off. In these scenarios, we want all three levers forwards, throttle full, propeller fine, mixture rich. Therefore, this means that for the blue lever, forward is fine, so full back must be feathered. This means that to unfeather, we must push the lever forwards.",

During detonation, the fuel/air charge explodes rather than burning smoothly. Because of this explosion, the charge exerts a much higher force on the piston and cylinder, leading to increased noise, vibration, and cylinder head temperatures. The violence of detonation also causes a reduction in power. Mild detonation may increase engine wear, though some engines can operate with mild detonation. However, severe detonation can cause engine failure in minutes. Because of the noise that it makes, detonation is called \"engine knock\". Detonation and its resulting high heat is detrimental to piston engine operation. Its cumulative effects can lead to piston, ring, and cylinder head failure and place thermal stress on other operating components.

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.04: Describe the function and the principle of operation of the following main components of a turbocharger: turbine; compressor; waste gate; waste-gate actuator. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. Turbochargers (and any superchargers, really) increase the amount of air (and therefore fuel) we can ignite in the cylinders, and are measured by the MAP; the higher the MAP, the more air/fuel mixture we can burn in each power stroke. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for mixing with fuel and then entry into the cylinders (or sent straight into the cylinders where fuel injection takes place). All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use. The turbochargers we talk about are controlled by waste-gates, which are situated in the exhaust manifold, and decide how much exhaust gas to divert to the turbine; if the MAP is too low (for what has been asked for), then the waste-gate will send more air to the turbine to get a faster spinning compressor, and vice-versa. The movement of the waste-gate is powered by the oil pressure on the waste-gate actuator which is cleverly controlled by a system that measures the MAP and makes changes to the oil pressure accordingly, thereby moving the waste-gate actuator, and the waste-gate position. To go a little deeper, the waste-gate (as per its name) actually controls how much exhaust gas is allowed to bypass the turbine, and by closing the waste-gate and letting no gas escape would mean that all the gas would go through the turbine (to cause a high MAP) and vice versa (open waste-gate for slow turbine/compressor for lower MAP).",

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.05: Explain the difference between an altitude-boosted turbocharger and a ground-boosted turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same manifold pressure and power output up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. For this reason, most aircraft use altitude boosted turbochargers, not ground boosted turbochargers. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use. As for the other options: The power should not increase with altitude (in any meaningful way), it should either remain roughly the same or decrease above a certain altitude. The reducing temperature of the air increases air density so actually aids power output slightly. Again, the power output shouldn't increase with increasing altitude.",

Volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the volume of the mixture induced into the cylinder during normal engine operation, to the volume of the mixture which would be required to fill the cylinder at standard temperature and pressure. To make it simple, the bigger the volumetric efficiency of a given engine, the bigger the power produced. Therefore, the simplest way to increase it, would be to increase the amount of mixture entering the cylinder, which is the exact purpose of the superchargers. Because in this question it is stated that the MAP is maintained CONSTANT, it means that the pressure, and therefore the density inside the engine is higher than in the outside air you’re currently flying in. Additionally, the decrease in temperature further increases the density of the air flowing through the engine. Moreover, in a simple piston engine without turbocharging, the volumetric efficiency only increases by increasing RPM (=increased momentum of the gases) and/or with increasing altitude where the drop in air density produces a drop in exhaust backpressure, which in turn will further increase the mass flow (and density) in the cylinder.",

Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce a minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

Sometimes ignition may not switch off in all cylinders and the engine may continue to run, even though it has been shut down with the ignition switched off. When pre-ignition occurs, there’s some loss of power, the engine is running roughly, and contributes to further overheating the engine.

            "explanation": "Aircraft icing can be divided into two general types based on whether it affects power production or aerodynamics. Induction icing affects engine power and includes when ice forms in the carburettor venturi. It can occur when the outside air temperature is between -10°C and +30°C and with a high relative humidity. Carburettor icing is particularly common, as the air cools down significantly inside the carburettor, not only due to the decreased static pressure in the venturi section (decreasing the temperature adiabatically) but also the evaporation of the fuel inside the carburettor, which requires latent heat input, thereby cooling the air. It is worse when the throttle is low, thereby causing the throttle butterfly valve to have only a small opening, further increasing the venturi effect. As you can see by the graph above, the worst icing happens between about -1°C and +15°C, which shows that the second item is not correct. Fuel injection systems provide uniform and reliable fuel delivery, better icing protection, and quicker throttle response. They work on the principle of feeding fuel under pressure to the engine, therefore they don’t need a venturi in the air intake. Without any ducts that inevitably reduce the temperature by their nature, the fuel injection systems are less prone to air intake icing than the traditional carburetor fuel systems. However, icing still may occur due to precipitation that enters from the external environment and contaminates the ducts. Induction systems are prone to icing in the event of heavy precipitation during winter operations, as snow or freezing rain hitting the filters can block the induction system. The first item is not correct as well.",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

            "explanation": "The throttle controls the power output of the engine which is registered on the manifold pressure. The propeller control regulates the engine RPM and, in turn, the propeller RPM. - During take-off - when the forward motion of the airplane is at low speeds and when maximum power and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller sets up a low propeller angle (pitch). The low blade angle keeps the angle of attack, with respect to the relative wind small and efficient at the low speed. At the same time, it allows the propeller to \"slice it thin\" and handle a smaller mass of air per revolution. This light load allows the engine to turn at maximum rpm and develop maximum power. Although the mass of air per revolution is small, the number of revolutions per minute is high. - As the airspeed increases after lift-off, the load on the engine is lightened because of the small blade angle. The governor senses this and increases the blade angle slightly. Again => higher blade angle + higher speeds => keeps the angle of attack with respect to the relative wind small and efficient. - For climb (after take-off), the power output of the engine is reduced to climb power => by decreasing the manifold pressure (pretty straight forward) and lowering RPM by increasing the blade angle. (the angle of attack is kept small by increasing the blade angle with an increase in airspeed) - At cruising altitude, when the aeroplane is in level flight => less power is required to produce a higher airspeed than is used in climb. Consequently, engine power is again reduced by lowering the manifold pressure and increasing the blade angle (to decrease RPM). The higher airspeed and higher blade angle enable the propeller to handle a greater mass of air per second at still smaller slipstream velocity.",

This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. Each magneto is controlled by its own ignition switch. The switch isolates the magneto’s ignition circuit by connecting the circuit to Earth. In order to completely switch off the ignition system, the primary circuit needs to be grounded. In this condition, it is said to be ‘grounded’. However, if the grounding wire is broken, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. Note: If the primary circuit is grounded, it will automatically ground the secondary circuit as well.",

The use of high-octane fuels in engines not necessarily designed or modified to take advantage of the higher-grade gasoline. Continuous climb with a mixture setting fully rich. One thing that could be done to avoid spark plugs and cylinders fouling is clearing the engine in flight at regular intervals by opening not less than intermediate power and altering the engine rpm from cruise setting to maximum several times. This will avoid the fouling problem and will ensure that full power will be available if required (in case of missed approach for example).",

The 2 main types of propellers found in aviation reciprocating engines are the following: Fixed pitch propeller: which is the simplest type of propeller with no additional moving parts fitted to most light general aviation aircraft. The engine RPM, and so, the power generation is controlled by the throttle. The propeller’s pitch angle is fixed and designed to be efficient at the normal maximum cruising speed. Variable pitch propeller: designed to keep a set rpm throughout the entire flight range. The propeller controls the engine at this set rpm through a device called a Constant Speed Unit (CSU). Any variations in engine power output, which would normally produce a change in rpm, will be sensed by the CSU that will alter the propeller’s pitch angle to keep the rpm constant. To avoid an engine overboost the RPM will be increased before increasing the manifold pressure.",

In the absence of such a system, it is possible to deliver more fuel to the cylinders by pumping the throttle lever which will act on the accelerator pump and deliver more fuel. The priming pump will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the inlet manifold. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs.",

It has control over every available part of the engine, from fuel-air mixture to ignition timing and even the propeller controller for variable pitch propellers. Ignition timing is the point in the 4 stroke engine cycle where the air/fuel mixture is ignited, and as RPM increases, the ignition timing should get earlier in the cycle to provide the best efficiency. In a diesel engine, this is the point where the fuel is injected, as it immediately ignites. The advantages of FADEC on piston engines include: Reduced weight Optimum efficiency No possibility of exceeding engine limitations Easy engine diagnostics There are also disadvantages to FADEC, which include: High complexity 2 ECUs are required to avoid a single point of failure No ability to gain excess power out of the engine in a crisis (e.g. terrain escape) Complete electrical failure means an engine failure (or uncontrollable engines) This question is on the topic of piston engine FADEC, which is currently used in a few light aircraft, such as the DA40, DA42, etc., but FADEC has been used for many years on turbine engines, and modern turbine engines are almost exclusively FADEC these days.",

            "explanation": "A piston engine operates using a cycle of induction, compression, combustion and exhaust. In the induction stroke, the fresh, unburnt air/fuel mixture enters the cylinder (is pulled in by the retreating piston). In the compression stroke, all valves are closed and the air/fuel mixture is compressed by the advancing piston. The combustion stroke is where the mixture is set alight by the spark plug, and the pressure generated by this combustion provides the power to push the piston downwards. The final stroke of a 4-stroke engine's \"Otto cycle\" is the exhaust stroke, where the piston advances one again and the burnt exhaust gasses are forced out through the exhaust valve. The combustion occurs at a higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, as the air/fuel mixture is compressed by the piston just before ignition. The amount of compression is known as the compression ratio (around 10:1 for petrol engines and around 20:1 for diesel engines), and this is a very important figure that dictates the combustion that occurs in the cylinder. The amount of fuel/air misture that is burnt in each cylinder can be increased also by various types of supercharger, which further increase the pressure above the atmospheric pressure, thereby increasing the power transfer of the combustion. Let's go through the options: \"Spark plug temperature and oil viscosity.\" Spark plugs provide a spark using an electrical arc, which by its very nature is hot enough to ignite the air fuel mixture. Oil should not be part of the combustion (and if it is, that is quite bad), so its viscosity isn't important to the combustion. \"Atmospheric pressure and carburettor compression.\" The atmospheric pressure affects the combustion, yes, but the carburettor simply mixes air and fuel and meters a certain amount of it to the engine, it doesn't compress anything. \"Atmospheric pressure and pressure within the cylinder.\" This is correct, as explained above, these pressures massively affect the combustion within the engine. \"Fuel viscosity and exhaust gas temperature.\" Fuel should be vapourised by this point so viscosity makes little difference. Exhaust gas temperature is an output, and doesn't affect the input or the pressures themselves.",

Let’s assume you have just arrived at your planned cruising level and you’re ready to lean your engine. Because you were climbing, your mixture was full rich, which was providing extra cooling to the cylinders. Now that you reached a higher level where the air density is much lower, you need to lean the mixture in order to achieve the perfect fuel/air ratio and achieve a better engine performance. You will therefore start to pull back (lean) the mixture control lever (red). Because you started to deliver less fuel to the cylinders, they will receive less cooling and the EGT will start to rise. The maximum EGT of a piston engine is theoretically associated with a fuel (mass) to air ratio of 1:15. As you will continue leaning, you will start noticing some roughness in the engine’s operation: the engine has been starved of fuel just enough to produce peak power, so the RPM will start dropping. Since the power produced is not enough, the EGT will also start to drop. If the mixture is enriched again by advancing the red lever, the power will surge again, and you will see an increase in RPM and you will reach an EGT that is lower to the peak you’ve found in step (2) and corresponds to the best power production mixture. It will also provide you a small surplus of fuel for cooling and safety buffer.",

The typical compressor usually fitted in a piston engine’s turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor. The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than the exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

The mixture creation is also different from the standard petrol engines as the diesel engines use direct fuel injection systems to mix the fuel and the air in a pre-chamber before supplying it to the cylinder. The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at a much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from a higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

As the intake valve is open, it allows the air/fuel mixture in the intake manifold to flow into the cylinder. Normally aspirated engines do not have any superchargers fitted. A supercharger is a device after the air intake (but before the carburettor) that compresses the intake air, increasing the manifold air pressure to allow an increased density of fuel/air mixture to enter the cylinders. It is particularly important for aircraft as they fly at high altitudes where the air density is low, causing a low engine power, as there is less air/fuel to burn. A turbocharger is a special type of supercharger that uses exhaust gas to power the compressor. To answer this question then, the force which causes the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinders in a normally aspirated engine is simply the pressure difference between ambient pressure (manifold pressure) and the pressure in the cylinder, which is decreasing throughout the intake stroke. At altitude, the ambient pressure is lower than at sea level, so there is less of a pressure differential, and lower mass flow into the cylinder, but the system of air intake is the same.",

A dry sump engine is one where the oil is not allowed to sit in the engine sump for too long, and is instead \"scavenged\" back to a separate reservoir. This is the opposite of a \"wet sump\" engine, where the sump (within the engine casing) is the reservoir, and a lot less systems are required, but with reduced engine power due to energy losses, and inability to perform many aerobatic manoeuvres. With a dry sump engine, the oil enters from the \"external\" reservoir, where it is stored when not at work in the engine, via a pressure pump, getting it up to a suitable pressure to spray inside the engine. The oil then lubricates, cools and cleans the engine components, finally ending up at the bottom of the engine, where it gathers in the sump, and is collected up by a scavenge pump, which returns it to the reservoir. The oil is often quite aerated and foamy by this point, so is less dense, and the scavenge pump needs a larger volume to cope with this oil, and not let it mount up in the sump. In comparison to the wet sump system, dry sump oil systems have: Better control of cooling, as the oil does not have to stay sat in the bottom of the hot engine; The ability to perform aerobatics and keep the engine correctly oiled; Less oil oxidation and contamination; Higher capacity for oil, as it limited by the external reservoir, which can be made larger than the engine sump.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.10: Explain the purpose of a supercharger and the basic differences from a turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. In reality, a turbocharger is a particular type of supercharger. All superchargers compress the fresh intake air so more fuel/air mixture can be burnt in each power stroke, thereby making the engine more powerful (or allowing it to maintain its power to higher altitudes). Supercharger is technically the umbrella term that covers all such devices, but in reality, most people refer to power augmentation devices as follows. Supercharger: An engine driven compressor which allows an increase in MAP. Turbocharger: A device where the excess heat and speed of the exhaust gasses drive a turbine which drives the compressor, allowing for increased MAP. There are various reasons for using each; superchargers do not suffer from turbo-lag, but do take power directly away from the crankshaft, whereas turbochargers are more efficient by taking energy away from the otherwise wasted exhaust gasses. In aircraft, turbochargers are far more widely used, but the learning objectives do ask us to understand the key differences between the two. Turbochargers do cause a small power loss that is not often talked about, and that is due to exhaust back pressure. Essentially, in an non-turbocharged engine, the exhaust gasses are allowed to flow freely from the cylinders during the exhaust stroke, but when a turbocharger is added (and the waste-gate is closed, meaning that all air goes through the turbine), there is some back pressure from the more restrictive flow through the turbine. This means that exhaust gasses are not removed as effectively, and the engine does lose out on a small amount of power. It is not a lot though, as the extra MAP means that the power increases massively for this small loss. On normally aspirated and supercharged (not turbo-) engines, though, the exhaust gasses are allowed to leave the engine without restriction, and technically, the higher we fly, the lower the ambient pressure, so the lower the exhaust back pressure. This is a very small gain of course, but it can make a difference, especially when a supercharger makes the engine perform like it is at a low altitude, but with even better exhaust gas removal.",

Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. The more air (and therefore fuel/air mixture) we can get into each cylinder, the more intense the flame, producing a much stronger power stroke. A turbocharger (or any supercharger, really) would run a compressor to increase the pressure of the fresh intake air, so more fuel/air mixture can enter the cylinders and provide more power during each power stroke. When an engine does not have one of these, it is referred to as being \"normally aspirated\", or \"naturally aspirated\". This means that the MAP will only ever be as high as the ambient pressure outside, and the mass flow (and power) through the engine depends completely on the density of the ambient air. The higher the aircraft flies, the lower the air density becomes, which means that the lower mass flow through a normally aspirated engine will produce less power. This is the same in hot conditions and also in high atmospheric humidity, where air density is low, and maximum power output is therefore reduced.",

Oil pressure is a very important indication to monitor during engine start and in-flight. High oil pressure may indicate a blockage in the system, whereas a low oil pressure would likely indicate a loss of oil through oil leak or damage, but may also indicate a pump failure. Oil temperature (another very important indication to monitor as a pilot) actually affects oil pressure quite a lot. On a cold morning, you will often find that the oil pressure rises higher than normal during engine start, and may stay that way for a couple of minutes whilst the oil warms up. This is because the oil starts at a temperature much colder than its usual operating temperature, and is much more viscous when cold (leading to slower fluid flow and higher pressure buildup). For this reason, some engines use thinner oils in winter to counteract the colder oil temperatures and avoid oil overpressure. As for the other options, high oil temperature is obviously the opposite of the correct answer, an oil leak would cause a small reduction, and eventual loss of oil pressure completely. Cowl flaps are more interesting: They are fitted to some aeroplanes to change how much airflow is available to cool the engine. With them closed, there is less airflow to cool the oil, so the oil will be warmer, and will not give a higher oil pressure indication.",

When the pilot reaches the top of climb (especially when climbing at Max Continuous Power), they must reduce their power output and set the aircraft up for the cruise. This is usually done by bringing backwards both throttle and RPM levers (and sometimes the mixture lever also). Pilots who fly aircraft fitted with constant speed (variable pitch) propellers, will choose a power setting to fly at, which includes an RPM setting and a manifold pressure setting. When retarding the thrust from climb to cruise, the pilot will first reduce the MAP (manifold absolute pressure) by retarding the throttle, then reducing the RPM lever to the cruise setting after this (usually less than the climb RPM, primarily for the reason of better fuel economy at lower RPMs), then re-adjust the MAP if necessary. This order of operations avoids an overboost scenario. The answer to this question is therefore a decrease of both the MAP and RPM, and the RPM is decreased by increasing the blade angle of the propeller. The RPM is usually retarded more than the MAP is in this process (as this contributes to better fuel economy), so the increase in blade angle from reduced RPM outweighs the increased blade angle from decreased MAP, and the blade angle is increased overall.",

Now when considering the pressure, we know that the total pressure always remains constant in subsonic airflow. Next, knowing that the total pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus the static pressure, we know that if one increases, the other must decrease to maintain a constant total pressure. Now what is the dynamic pressure and what is static pressure: Dynamic pressure is equal to: q = ½ rho V2. Therefore we can say that the dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity of the airflow. Static pressure is the pressure that any object feels even when not moving. This pressure is caused by the force of gravity forcing particles closer together and pushing against each other and any objects around them. Knowing that dynamic pressure is basically the velocity of the airflow, we can say that if the velocity increase, hence increasing the dynamic pressure, there has to be a reduction in static pressure. This is known as Bernoulli’s principle! What this means for our question is that: Converging streamlines indicate a speed increase Diverging streamlines indicated a speed decrease A decrease in static pressure occurs with an increasing speed And an increase in static pressure occurs with a decreasing speed",

The priming pump will be fitted in parallel with the main fuel pump (which is either electric or mechanical) and will take fuel from the filter housing and channel it to the inlet manifold. The necessary amount of priming required will mainly depend on the ambient temperature and how long the engine hasn’t been running. Priming is mostly necessary for the first flight of the day and during cold weather after the engine has been off for a few hours (depending on the engine type). However, sometimes it is not even needed as the engine will perfectly start without priming. Over-priming a hot engine could lead to a buildup of excessive fuel inside the cylinders (flooding), potentially increasing the risk of engine fire, flooding the engine, and fouling the spark plugs.",

            "explanation": "The question is basically asking you how to check the proper operation of the pitch adjustment system (i.e. the CSU) of your variable pitch propeller just after engine start up. The engine is started with the condition lever (blue) in the low pitch-high RPM position in order to reduce the load on the propeller and facilitate the starting sequence and warm-up. While the engine warm-up, the constant speed unit of the propeller should be operated carefully and smoothly through its whole range to determine whether the system is working properly and as expected. It is also the right moment to distribute some warm oil through the CSU’s governor and warm it up before take-off. In a constant speed propeller piston engine, you will find 3 levers in the cockpit: the throttle lever, the condition lever, and the mixture control lever. The throttle lever controls the power output of the engine and is monitored on the MAP gauge (in inches of mercury). The mixture control lever varies the fuel flow and corrects for variations in the fuel/air ratio. Finally, the condition lever will control the pitch of the propeller to increase its efficiency and will be monitored on the tachometer as the RPM will change. Therefore, the pitch adjustment mechanism of the propeller will be checked by moving the blue lever to high pitch – low RPM, and then by moving it back to a low pitch setting, ready for take-off. All the RPM variations during this testing sequence will be monitored on the tachometer.",

In order to completely switch off the ignition system, the primary circuit needs to be grounded. However, if the grounding wire is broken for instance, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. This is because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a rough, rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply (many aircraft engines are normally shutoff by removing the fuel supply anyway). Caution! Maintenance action should be sought before approaching the propeller since the engine can start at any time with these conditions. As for the other options: A grounded switch wire in the magneto primary circuit will turn the magnetos off, so that is not a cause of the engine continuing to run. Fouled spark plugs are more likely to stop a running engine, and are unlikely to continue running an engine that has been switched off. A defective condenser will most likely make the engine run rough or stop in normal operations.",

It is a system designed to take the task of managing engine parameters away from the pilot and have a computer do the job instead. This has many advantages, such as weight saving and \"care free\" handling of the engine, as well as increased efficiency and reduced chance of overspeed/overtorque. They do have some disadvantages, in the fact that a FADEC failure can fail the whole engine, and a full electrical failure would have the same effect. These disadvantages can be reduced by creating redundancy within the system. The main source of redundancy is that each engine is fitted with 2 seperate FADEC systems, that can either operate the engine perfectly well. Each is usually fed by a seperate electrical system as well, with backup batteries, reducing the chance of total failure.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.04: Describe the function and the principle of operation of the following main components of a turbocharger: turbine; compressor; waste gate; waste-gate actuator. Turbocharger compresses the intake air when needed. Turbochargers are very useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which puts a lot of strain on the engine. A turbocharger works by using the speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then uses that energy to spin the compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. We cannot allow the turbocharger to run wild though, as too much pressure (MAP) can cause the engine to \"overboost\", and even fail quite spectacularly. The way we regulate the turbocharger is by varying how much air gets to the turbine, this is via a wastegate system. the exhaust gasses can go down two different tubes, one is a standard exhaust, straight out of the aircraft (bypassing the turbine). The other is a tube to the turbine, to spin up the turbocharger. The wastegate is a butterfly valve that can block the exhaust tube, so when it is closed, all the exhaust gasses go to the turbine, making the compressor/turbine spin fastest. As altitude rises, the waste gate gradually closes to enhance turbocharger boost. When fully closed, the turbocharger delivers maximum boost at the critical altitude.",

            "explanation": "CRITICAL ENGINE One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (distance from the CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). In the case of a propeller engine aircraft the length of the thrust arm is determined by the asymmetric effect of the propeller. At a positive angle of attack, the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller, when viewed from the rear, is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade. If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment; a higher IAS (VMC) would be necessary to maintain directional control. At a given IAS, the situation would be more critical if the left engine failed. The rudder is used to prevent yaw, and the wings are maintained level with aileron. The fore and aft CG location has no effect on the yawing moment from a failed engine, but will influence the rudder arm, hence the rudder moment. CG on the aft limit will give the smallest rudder arm and the least ability to oppose the yawing moment from a failed engine. Video Explanation:",

The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

In fact, the rate of pressure rise will sometimes occur too early in the power stroke for the piston to be forced downwards. Therefore, most of the chemical energy created will be wasted as heat. The cylinder walls, the piston head, the sparking plugs, and the exhaust valves are put under a sudden \"shock load\" when detonation occurs, and this will sound like a knocking inside the engine. Detonation puts an engine under intense shock loading which can quite quickly cause engine failures. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure, high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (the action is to retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

            "explanation": "A magneto is a self-contained, engine-driven electrical generator designed to supply a high voltage to the sparking plugs. This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. In order to break the gap between the sparking plug electrodes, the magnetos consist of a rotating permanent magnet surrounded by a U-shaped stator of soft iron, around which a thick primary and a thin secondary winding can be found. The thick winding (primary) is the low-tension element of the circuit and consists only of a few turns of thick wire. Whereas the thin winding (secondary) is the high-tension element of the circuit consisting of numerous thin windings that act as a step-up transformer. As a consequence of this arrangement, any electrical current in the primary circuit (thick winding) will induce a higher voltage in the secondary winding. Both windings will be supplied with alternating current from the permanent set of magnetos as they’re driven by the engine. Another important aspect you need to understand in the principle of magnetos operation is that the primary winding will be continuously broken and then restored by a contact breaker. The contact will be broken by a permanently rotating breaker cam whose main task is to break the primary circuit. The reason why we need the primary circuit to get broken is that this will create a collapse in the primary’s winding magnetic field that will produce an increase in energy in the secondary winding. The second reason is that the normal AC produced in the primary winding will be converted into a series of pulses. The general outcome of this sequence of actions will result in a series of very high voltage, low current pulses of electricity that will be fed to a distributor. The distributor’s task will be then to spread these pulses through a high-tension leads to the spark plugs.",

            "explanation": "Note: This should really be a Principle of Flight question, but we have feedback that there are a few questions like this being asked in AGK also. Any further exam feedback is always useful, and can be put in the comments or emailed directly to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This question is similar to 213150, but asking about the other end of the spectrum. Also, this is a different question altogether from the similar looking question 219782, which is asking about yawing, where this question is more focused on maintaining continuous stable flight. They can be easily mistaken in an exam, but have different reasoning and answers. The critical engine part of the question does not really matter, either engine would have the same answer. Firstly, we are looking for anything that either increases the yawing moment caused by the engine failure (which we have to counteract using the rudder), or anything that reduces the effectiveness of our rudder, so we would have to use more of it to produce the same effect. Initially, we can say that the further forward our centre of gravity (CG), the larger the moment arm from the rudder to the CG, and the more effective our rudder is. Therefore, our rudder is least effective at an aft CG and we would need to put more stress through it to produce the same amount of moment. SIDESLIP Next, we have to consider the sideslip configuration of the aircraft, as well as how that is indicated on our instruments. Remember that the sideslip ball indicator is not useful in the usual sense when we have an engine failure, as it only really measures the direction of the \"local gravity\", the G-forces on the aircraft. 1) Wings-level flight The moment (turning force) of the asymmetric thrust must be counteracted by the rudder, which makes the aircraft maintain its heading, but causes it to track with a sideslip towards the dead engine (meaning that the airflow is coming at the aircraft from the side of the dead engine). This requires a lot of rudder to maintain, and leaves us in a sideslip condition with a lot of drag. Our sideslip ball indicator will be central in this configuration, therefore, even though this is a sideslip condition, it has \"no slip indication\". 2) Banking towards the live engine A small bank angle towards the operative engine (up to 5° AoB, \"five to the live\") can reduce or even remove the sideslip using the weight of the aircraft to counteract the tendency to fly away from the live engine. It is a commonly used configuration to acquire slightly more aircraft performance during an engine failure, but not too much bank angle, as that begins to negate the effect and reduce performance again. This reduces the required moment of the rudder (mostly because it is no longer having to fight the weather-cocking effect of the fin and aft fuselage) This reduces the aircraft's actual sideslip but a slip ball indicator would show approximately 1/2 a ball deflection to the operative engine. This is because there is no turning force and so the only G-force that the ball detects is straight down, and as we are banked, that means slightly towards whichever way we have banked (the live engine). Therefore, the correct answer to cause the most strain on the rudder is to have an aft CG and no slip indication (wings-level flight).",

For a gasoline (petrol) engine, the chemically correct air/fuel mixture to burn for maximum combustion efficiency is 15:1, so 15 grams of air for each 1 gram of fuel. This is called the stoichiometric ratio. This is not the best mixture to run a piston engine at though, as it leads to very hot combustion and can heat up the cylinders and pistons too much, causing damage. The weaker we run the mixture (more air, less fuel, for instance 16:1), the less fuel there is able to combust, so the engine runs slightly cooler, but produces less power. This is called running \"lean of peak\", and it is often the most economical way of flying piston engines in the cruise. Running an engine slightly richer than 15:1, say for instance 14:1, gives increased power (but less efficient combustion) due to slightly more fuel available for burning. It is still cooler than running at the chemically correct 15:1 ratio, though, as the extra fuel adds to cooling the engine. Running the mixture full rich, around 10:1 mixture, has a small reduction in maximum power, but gives increased engine reliability as the extra fuel not being burnt is used for engine cooling, and is very effective for keeping the cylinders and pistons cool. It is therefore what we use for take-off and landing, and any changes in power during flight.",

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.05: Explain the difference between an altitude-boosted turbocharger and a ground-boosted turbocharger. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. Turbochargers (and any superchargers, really) increase the amount of air (and therefore fuel) we can ignite in the cylinders, so if we used full turbocharger at take-off, for instance, the forces on the engine would be enormous, and would put too much strain on an engine. We do this in road cars, because we can make engines stronger/heavier, and if they fail it is not life threatening, but with aircraft engines, we cannot afford to gain the extra power for fear of failure, so we simply use it to compensate for the reduction in air density. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use.",

Therefore, since the CSU also works on oil pressurized by the engine, it will become inoperative as well. Because of this, only two outside forces will act on the propeller’s blades: the centrifugal and the aerodynamic turning moment. The aerodynamic force will tend to move the blade pitch angle towards a coarse pitch, whereas the centrifugal force tends to turn the blade to a fine pitch. Since the centrifugal force is greater than the aerodynamic force, the propeller will be pushed to fine pitch by the centrifugal twisting moment and will create a solid resistive propeller disk that will resist against the relative airflow, creating a lot of drag. Additionally, the system also consists of a speeder spring that is directly linked to the RPM selection controller (blue lever). When there’s no more oil pressure, the spring will automatically move until the fine pitch stop by pushing all the oil out of the propeller hub and resulting in a drop in RPM.",

Any variations in engine power output (throttle pulled back or forward), which would otherwise produce a change in rpm, are sensed by the CSU which alters the propeller pitch angle to keep the rpm constant. If the throttle is pulled back, the propeller pitch would automatically decrease (fine pitch) but the RPM will remain the same, and vice-versa. The governor controls a hydraulic servo system feeding high-pressure oil, via a pilot valve, to a piston in the pitch change mechanism (PCM). The CSU operates on the principle of balancing a spring pressure against the centrifugal force of rotating governor flyweights, driven directly from the engine or reduction gearbox. Usually, in a piston engine, the governor flyweights are tensioned by a speeder spring, which is controlled from the cockpit by setting the RPM lever. In a turboprop, however, the most efficient engine RPM is maintained by pre-tensioning the speeder spring to give the maximum engine RPM at all times.",

The mixture creation is also different from the standard petrol engines as the diesel engines use direct fuel injection systems to mix the fuel and the air in a pre-chamber before supplying it to the cylinder. The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at a much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from a higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

Any further exam feedback is always useful, and can be put in the comments or emailed directly to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This is very similar to question 214523, but asking about the other end of the spectrum. CG CONSIDERATIONS Firstly, we are looking for anything that either decreases the yawing moment caused by the engine failure (which we would usually have to counteract using the rudder), or anything that increases the effectiveness of our rudder, so we would have to use less of it to produce the same effect. Initially, we can say that the further forward our centre of gravity (CG), the larger the moment arm from the rudder to the CG, and the more effective our rudder is. Therefore, our rudder is most effective at a forward CG and we would need to put less stress through it to produce the same amount of moment. SIDESLIP Next, we have to consider the sideslip configuration of the aircraft, as well as how that is indicated on our instruments. Remember that the sideslip ball indicator is not useful in the usual sense when we have an engine failure, as it only really measures the direction of the \"local gravity\", the G-forces on the aircraft. 1) First consider wings-level flight. The moment (turning force) of the asymmetric thrust must be counteracted by the rudder, which makes the aircraft maintain its heading, but causes it to track with a sideslip towards the dead engine (meaning that the airflow is coming at the aircraft from the side of the dead engine). This requires a lot of rudder to maintain, and leaves us in a sideslip condition with a lot of drag. Our sideslip ball indicator will be central in this configuration, therefore, even though this is a sideslip condition, it has \"no slip indication\" 2) Banking towards the live engine A small bank angle towards the operative engine (up to 5° AoB, \"five to the live\") can reduce or even remove the sideslip using the weight of the aircraft to counteract the tendency to fly away from the live engine. It is a commonly used configuration to acquire slightly more aircraft performance during an engine failure, but not too much bank angle, as that begins to negate the effect and reduce performance again. This reduces the required moment of the rudder (mostly because it is no longer having to fight the weather-cocking effect of the fin and aft fuselage) This reduces the aircraft's actual sideslip but a slip ball indicator would show approximately 1/2 a ball deflection to the operative engine. This is because there is no turning force and so the only G-force that the ball detects is straight down, and as we are banked, that means slightly towards whichever way we have banked (the live engine). Therefore, the correct answer to cause the least strain on the rudder is to have a forward CG and 1/2 ball slip indication towards the operative engine (aircraft banked slightly towards the live engine).",

A dry sump engine is one where the oil is not allowed to sit in the engine sump for too long, and is instead \"scavenged\" back to a separate reservoir. This is the opposite of a \"wet sump\" engine, where the sump (within the engine casing) is the reservoir, and a lot less systems are required, but with reduced engine power due to losses. With a dry sump engine, the oil enters from the reservoir via a pressure pump (along with filters, coolers, and some sensors), getting it up to a suitable pressure to spray inside the engine. The oil then lubricates, cools and cleans the engine components, finally ending up at the bottom of the engine, where it gathers in the sump, and is collected up by a scavenge pump (more filters as well), which returns it to the reservoir. The oil is often quite aerated and foamy by this point, so is less dense, and the scavenge pump needs a larger volume to cope with this oil, and not let it mount up in the sump. The scavenge pump also needs to be a higher volume than the pressure pump, as the other way around would force more and more oil into the engine, and would create a potential flooding of the sump, which is supposed to hold oil only for a short amount of time, potentially damaging the engine by having too much oil.",

In order to completely switch off the ignition system, the primary circuit needs to be grounded. However, if the grounding wire is broken, the magneto will keep working normally and the engine will continue running. Another situation where the engine can keep running is when an excessive carbon deposit has formed in the cylinder head. Because the deposit is still hot enough when you arrive at your parking position after the flight in order to ignite the charge without the spark from the plugs. The effect will be a hardly rumbling engine that is still running. If this ever happens and the engine doesn’t stop, you can simply pull back the mixture control lever (red) and shut off the fuel supply. Caution! Maintenance action should be sought before touching the propeller since the engine can start at any time with one magneto still un-grounded.",

The biggest difference between the two is where the oil stored when not in use. In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the oil reservoir. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Wet-sump systems are quite common on ground vehicle engines and older aircraft engines, as they are less complex than dry-sump systems, and therefore are less prone to failure. They do have a fair few disadvantages, though. These include not being able to properly oil the engine during some aerobatic manoeuvres, and a reduced amount of oil capacity, and reduced cooling capacity, due to the oil only being stored in the bottom of the engine. There are also some small performance losses due to more oil splashing about in the bottom of the engine.",

The turbocharger is an externally driven supercharger that main advantage over the simpler supercharger is the usage of energy that would otherwise be lost to drive its impeller. That energy is nothing else than exhaust gases. The turbocharger consists of two exhaust gas inlets that receive and direct the exhaust gases towards the turbine wheel. The exhaust gases mechanically spin the turbine before leaving the system through an exhaust gas outlet. The turbine is connected through a solid common shaft to a compressor, and the rotating energy gained from the exhaust gases circulation will serve to drive the compressor. At the compressor’s end, there’s also an inlet that will receive and direct ambient air to the compressor’s impeller eye. The air will then leave the impeller almost at a tangent to the periphery and trade velocity for an increase in pressure and temperature. The boost air under pressure obtained from this process will then be ducted to mix with the fuel and follow its path towards combustion. The pressure of the compressed air (boost) can be monitored only on the cockpit MAP gauge.",

After you set your engine at one of these power settings, you will switch off each magneto in turn and check that the RPM drops within specific limits (usually 100 RPM) and the engine runs smoothly. As a result you will find out that if one of the magnetos fails during flight, engine power is not significantly compromised. If, however, during the mag drop checks you notice that the engine stops it would indicate that one half of the magnetos isn’t properly working, whereas if there’s no drop in RPM it means that one half of the ignition system is not being earthed and maintenance support should be seek.",

In a diesel engine this is the point where the fuel is injected, as it immediately ignites. The advantages of FADEC on piston engines include: Reduced weight Optimum efficiency No possibility of exceeding engine limitations Easy engine diagnostics There are also disadvantages to FADEC, which include: High complexity 2 ECUs are required to avoid a single point of failure No ability to gain excess power out of the engine in a crisis (e.g. terrain escape) Complete electrical failure means an engine failure (or uncontrollable engines)",

The cylinder walls, the piston’s head, the sparking plugs and the exhaust valves are being hardly damaged when detonation occurs as this will cause a sudden knock. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure leading to a high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a toolow octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburetor heating at high power settings (takeoff/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (= retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which puts a lot of strain on the engine. A turbocharger works by using the speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then uses that energy to spin the compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for entry into the cylinders. We cannot allow the turbocharger to run wild though, as too much pressure (MAP) can cause the engine to \"overboost\", and even fail quite spectacularly. The way we regulate the turbocharger is by varying how much air gets to the turbine, this is via a wastegate system. the exhaust gasses can go down two different tubes, one is a standard exhaust, straight out of the aircraft (bypassing the turbine). The other is a tube to the turbine, to spin up the turbocharger. The wastegate is a butterfly valve that can block the exhaust tube, so when it is closed, all the exhaust gasses go to the turbine, making the compressor/turbine spin fastest. When the engine reaches its maximum MAP, the oil system which regulates the wastegate begins to open it, letting some of the \"waste\" air straight out of the aircraft, so it does not continue to run the turbine, which might overboost the engine.",

The biggest difference between the two is where the oil stored when not in use. In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the external oil reservoir and then pumped back to the engine to work again. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine crankcase, where the oil naturally drains to. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Wet-sump systems are quite common on ground vehicle engines and older aircraft engines, as they are less complex than dry-sump systems, and therefore are less prone to failure. They do have a fair few disadvantages, though. These include not being able to properly oil the engine during some aerobatic manoeuvres, and a reduced amount of oil capacity, and reduced cooling capacity, due to the oil only being stored in the bottom of the engine. There are also some small performance losses due to more oil splashing about in the bottom of the engine.",

The mixture creation is also different from the standard petrol engines as the diesel engines use direct fuel injection systems to mix the fuel and the air in a pre-chamber before supplying it to the cylinder. The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way, as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

When the waste gate fully closes, it directs all the exhaust gases to the turbine, causing it to accelerate. This is exactly what will happen at a high cruising altitude.

Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this so we can verify the question, thank you! There are two main types of oil system for engines, dry-sump and wet-sump. The biggest difference between the two is where the oil stored when not in use. In a dry-sump system, the oil is pumped from the bottom of the engine to the oil reservoir. In a wet-sump system, the oil is stored in the \"sump\", which is just the area at the bottom of the engine, where the oil naturally drains to. In a dry-sump system, the engine oil is collected in the sump, then pumped back into an external reservoir, where it is stored when not in the engine. Wet sump systems are simpler and cheaper, but they have a smaller oil capacity than dry-sump systems, and often have problems cooling the engine during aerobatic manoeuvres, and reduce engine performance slightly due to splashing, etc. Therefore, this question is not describing any single type of oil system. The oil is kept underneath the engine (wet-sump systems keep it at the bottom of the engine, we do not consider this the same). There is no external reservoir (therefore it cannot be a dry sump system). The oil capacity is \"higher\", which is the characteristic of a dry sump, not a wet sump system. As mentioned above, the correct answer could also be \"wet sump\" if the question is different to what we have, but so far we do not have enough information to say for sure.",

If there’s a larger mass of air entering the venturi, the pressure drop will be excessive at the venturi throat, which will result in a larger addition of fuel making the mixture too rich. To avoid this imbalance, air from the pressure balance duct is fed through a drilled tube (tube with holes) which is the diffuser. The diffuser’s openings are precisely dimensioned to guarantee that the correct mixture ratio is maintained across the entire engine’s speed range. When the engine is running at idle, the levels in the diffuser and float chamber are almost equal. However, when the engine is running, the fuel level in the diffuser drops because of the slight restraint caused by the carburettor’s jet. This will uncover some of the diffuser’s openings allowing air from the pressure balance duct to flow in. This reduces the pressure at the nozzle, thus reducing the fuel flow and allowing a balanced mixture.",

            "explanation": "Piston Engines have always suffered from icing problems in some of the conditions that aircraft require them to be operated. There are two type of piston engine induction system, they both suffer from induction icing differently. Carburettors - The original method for mixing fuel and air prior to the cylinder, the carburettor uses the venturi effect to \"suck\" fuel out of the tube, into the airstream. For icing considerations, this has two problems; the fuel vaporising requires latent heat to be input, removing heat from the surrounding air, and the low pressure in the venturi (and throttle valve) which further cools the air. In certain conditions, These could make the air colder than 0ºC, and it would then be possible to form ice on the walls of the carburettor, and on the throttle valve, especially at low throttle settings where the throttle valve only has a small gap for the air to pass through, which will cause even lower pressure (annexes above). This is on top of the usual icing that can form, such as on air filters or wherever the air impacts a cold metal surface, similar to airframe icing. Carburettor heat can be used intermittently to provide hot air to the induction system and melt any ice. Fuel Injection - A system where the exact amount of fuel is injected into the intake air, either just before the intake valve, or inside the cylinder. As there is no venturi and no fuel evaporation in this system, the usual \"carburettor icing\" concerns are no longer an issue. However, icing may still form, such as at any bends in the system, or where the air has to impact a cold surface such as the air filter, similar to airframe icing. Fuel icing is also possible (but it is possible in a carburettor system also, so that is not the correct answer). Fuel injected engines have an \"alternate air\" system which will bypass any such problems if required. Therefore, from those options, the answer is actually quite simple, ice accretion affects both types of induction system.",

However, a failure of an airplane engine due to fuel issues can be potentially fatal, so safety dictates that aviation fuel must conform to very stringent requirements. It is made of various selected grades of gasoline, combined to give high anti-knock ratings. The octane rating of a fuel indicates its resistance to detonation. The use of too low octane gasoline in a piston engine will increase the chances of detonation. However, using fuel with a higher-octane grade is perfectly normal provided it is designed to take advantage of a higher-grade fuel. In fact, using a higher-grade fuel in a low-performance engine will not benefit you as this may cause fouling of the cylinders and eventual mechanical failure. For your general knowledge, the octane rating is based on the knock resistance difference between two spirits, iso-octane (which is very good) and heptane (very poor). By degrading iso-octane with heptane until the blend detonated in a variable compression engine under the same standard conditions as the fuel under test, it was possible to classify that fuel by a number representing the percentage of iso-octane in the test mixture. In this way, 89-octane fuel corresponded to a mixture of 89% iso-octane and 11% heptane.",

            "explanation": "Oil is the primary fluid used to lubricate an engine. It also assists with cleaning, cooling and detecting engine problems. The main purpose of lubrication is to reduce the friction between the moving surfaces and dissipate heat from the moving parts. In a gas turbine engine, the largest and some of the most important moving parts are the ball and roller main bearings of the main driveshafts, which would also crucially require an oil supply. In a piston engine, the cylinders require oil to stop metal rubbing directly against metal, as well as the bearings from the crankshafts, camshafts, etc. Oil pressure in particular is one of the most important parameters to monitor during engine start. If you don’t observe an increase in oil pressure, it means the oil isn't flowing properly, and the moving parts of the engine will generate a lot of heat due to friction, quickly resulting in engine damage, a fire, or eventually the engine welding itself together, causing a complete seizure. The oil pressure transmitter is usually located just after the engine pressure pumps, before the oil reaches the engine components. As for the other options: A low oil temperature is fine as the oil needs time to heat up in a cold engine. The filter bypass warning means that the filter is clogged and the oil has bypassed it, so is now unfiltered. It is an issue, but not quite as urgent as a low pressure indication (dirty oil is still better than no oil). The chip detector is a magnetic part of the oil lines that collects any ferrous metal particles that are in the oil, which sometimes has a sensor that can go off if too many metal shavings are picked up. This indicated damage to internal engine components, and is a big problem, but again, not as urgent as a low pressure indication.",

            "explanation": "Diesel engines are sometimes labeled as ‘compression ignition’ engines as it uses the heat generated during the compression stroke to ignite the mixture. For this reason, diesel engines are not fitted with spark plugs and are not heated (except in icing conditions) and require less maintenance and spare parts which ultimately reduces costs. The mixture creation is also different from the standard petrol engines as the diesel engines use direct fuel injection systems to mix the fuel and the air in a pre-chamber before supplying it to the cylinder. The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at a much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from a higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

In fact, the rate of pressure rise will occur too early in the power stroke for the piston to move downwards. Therefore, most of the chemical energy created will be wasted as heat. The cylinder walls, the piston’s head, the sparking plugs and the exhaust valves are being hardly damaged when detonation occurs as this will cause a sudden knock. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure leading to a high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a toolow octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburetor heating at high power settings (takeoff/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (= retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

If there’s a larger mass of air entering the venturi, the pressure drop will be excessive at the venturi throat, which will result in a larger addition of fuel making the mixture too rich. To avoid this imbalance, air from the pressure balance duct is fed through a drilled tube (tube with holes) which is the diffuser. The diffuser’s openings are precisely dimensioned to guarantee that the correct mixture ratio is maintained across the entire engine’s speed range. When the engine is running at idle, the levels in the diffuser and float chamber are almost equal. However, when the engine is running, the fuel level in the diffuser drops because of the slight restraint caused by the carburettor’s jet. This will uncover some of the diffuser’s openings allowing air from the pressure balance duct to flow in. This reduces the pressure at the nozzle, thus reducing the fuel flow and allowing a balanced mixture.",

In fact, the rate of pressure rise will occur too early in the power stroke for the piston to move downwards. Therefore, most of the chemical energy created will be wasted as heat. The cylinder walls, the piston’s head, the sparking plugs and the exhaust valves are being hardly damaged when detonation occurs as this will cause a sudden knock. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure leading to a high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a too low octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburetor heating at high power settings (takeoff/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (= retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

Therefore it has no role in sending the fuel to the cylinders. “Discharge nozzle”: this is the nozzle that sprays the fuel into the intake/cylinder.

The fuel injection system consists of atomizers that will spray the fuel into the pre-chamber, but because not all the fuel droplets burn completely, residual soot will remain in the cylinder. To produce enough heat for the mixture to ignite, the diesel engines operate at a much higher compression ratios than the normal petrol engine: from 14:1 up to 28:1 for the most powerful compared to 9:1 for a petrol engine. Because of this high compression ratio, diesel engines also benefit from a higher thermal efficiency. The amount of power delivered will only be determined by the fuel flow. In the same way as for car engines, diesel engines are less powerful than a petrol engine for the same swept volume.",

            "explanation": "Starting a piston engine (especially on a cold day with a cold engine) can be difficult. It requires the input of the correct mixture of fuel and air into the cylinders. Too much fuel, the mixture will be too rich to start (flooded engine); too little fuel and there is not enough fuel to burn, and the aircraft will not start. The perfect ratio of Fuel : Air is approximately 15:1 (by mass). Priming an engine is a way to enrich the mixture for start, by firing atomised fuel directly into the cylinder intake valve area. The best way to do this is by using a fitted primer system. This is a hand operated pump that bypasses the standard aircraft carburettor, and the pilot can decide how much fuel to add directly into the cylinders, by how many pumps of the primer they decide to do. Too few, and the engine might not have enough fuel to start; too many and the cylinders will become flooded and cause a large risk of fire during start. Another way to \"prime\" an engine is to exercise the throttle prior to engine start. This uses the \"accelerator pump\" inside the carburettor (made to stop the engine getting too lean if full power is applied suddenly) to pump some fuel into the carburettor box. This can be effective on a lot of engines, but it is much less safe and effective than the dedicated primer pump, as the fuel is not atomised as well, and is not in the engine at all, in fact, it is often quite a distance before (and much below) the intake valves of the engine. This means that it requires airflow through the carburettor during start to pull the extra fuel up into the engine, and there is chance of backfiring due to the high amount of fuel sat in the carburettor. It could also lead to over-priming by using this technique, as only a small amount of the fuel is atomised, and the rest forms puddles in the carburettor box. To address the other options, the primer does not spray fuel directly onto the spark plugs, it atomises it just behind the intake valve of one or more cylinders (this is the best place to put the fuel for immediate entry to the correct cylinders). Carburettor heat will not help with this, as there is no heat to make the air different from normal, and the carburettor heat should not be used in excess on the ground due to the lack of sufficient air filter.",

However, a failure of an airplane engine due to fuel issues can be potentially fatal, so safety dictates that aviation fuel must conform to very stringent requirements. It is made of various selected grades of gasoline, combined to give high anti-knock ratings. The octane rating of a fuel indicates its resistance to detonation. The use of too low octane gasoline in a piston engine will increase the chances of detonation. However, using fuel with a higher-octane grade is perfectly normal provided it is designed to take advantage of a higher-grade fuel. In fact, using a higher-grade fuel in a low-performance engine will not benefit you as this may cause fouling of the cylinders and eventual mechanical failure. For your general knowledge, the octane rating is based on the knock resistance difference between two spirits, iso-octane (which is very good) and heptane (very poor). By degrading iso-octane with heptane until the blend detonated in a variable compression engine under the same standard conditions as the fuel under test, it was possible to classify that fuel by a number representing the percentage of iso-octane in the test mixture. In this way, 89-octane fuel corresponded to a mixture of 89% iso-octane and 11% heptane.",

A dry sump engine is one where the oil is not allowed to sit in the engine sump for too long, and is instead \"scavenged\" back to a separate reservoir. This is the opposite of a \"wet sump\" engine, where the sump (within the engine casing) is the reservoir, and a lot less systems are required, but with reduced engine power due to energy losses, and inability to perform many aerobatic manoeuvres. With a dry sump engine, the oil enters from the \"external\" reservoir, where it is stored when not at work in the engine, via a pressure pump, getting it up to a suitable pressure to spray inside the engine. The oil then lubricates, cools and cleans the engine components, finally ending up at the bottom of the engine, where it gathers in the sump, and is collected up by a scavenge pump, which returns it to the reservoir. The oil is often quite aerated and foamy by this point, so is less dense, and the scavenge pump needs a larger volume to cope with this oil, and not let it mount up in the sump. In comparison to the wet sump system, dry sump oil systems have: Better control of cooling, as the oil does not have to stay sat in the bottom of the hot engine; The ability to perform aerobatics and keep the engine correctly oiled; Less oil oxidation and contamination; higher capacity for oil, as it limited by the external reservoir, which can be made larger than the engine sump.",

The cylinder walls, the piston’s head, the sparking plugs and the exhaust valves are being hardly damaged when detonation occurs as this will cause a sudden knock. The conditions in which detonation is most likely in a piston engine are a high manifold pressure leading to a high cylinder head temperature and low RPM. The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a too low octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburetor heating at high power settings (takeoff/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (= retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture.",

The risk of detonation can be reduced by: First of all, always using the correct grade of fuel designed for your aircraft’s engine. Using a too low octane rating will greatly increase the likelihood of detonation. The octane is actually a measure of detonation resistance, higher octane fuel will detonate less readily. Making sure the proper mixture is being supplied to the engine in any conditions. The greater the amount of fuel for a given amount of air, the greater the power that can be obtained without detonation. This is primarily due to the extra cooling effect of excess fuel. Avoid situations where the temperature and pressure of the mixture raise before it burns, such as applying carburettor heating at high power settings (take-off/climb). However, if you ever experience detonation during flight, the following corrective action should be carried: Reduce the manifold pressure (the action is to retard the throttle) Fully enrich the mixture. Of course, retarding the throttle seems counterintuitive during the climb, especially with an engine problem, but detonation is really inefficient and could cause an engine failure, so it is better to retard the throttle slightly until detonation stops, allowing a climb, albeit at a shallower gradient (rather than no climb at all). Also, it is useful to increase airspeed to allow better cooling of the engine.",

That is all we know at the moment, but it should not be seen in this subject, as it is not on the learning objectives. Please let us know if you see it or any similar questions in your AGK exam, thank you! When an engine fails on a multi-engine aircraft, there will be a decrease in thrust and an increase in drag on the side of the failed engine. Primarily there will be a yawing moment towards the failed (dead) engine. The critical engine is the engine which would give the biggest yawing moment if it fails. One of the factors influencing the yawing moment following an engine failure on a multi-engine aircraft is the length of the thrust arm (i.e., distance from the aircraft's CG to the thrust line of the operating engine). In case of a propeller engine aircraft, the length of the thrust arm is determined by the asymmetric effect of the propeller. When the aircraft is flying with a positive angle of attack (which is normal), the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller (when viewed from the rear) is displaced to the right of the engine centre line. This is because the down-going blade generates more thrust than the up-going blade (P-factor). If both engines rotate clockwise, the starboard (right) engine will have a longer thrust arm than the port (left) engine. If the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a larger yawing moment. If both engines rotate inward, they will have the same (shorter) thrust arm (counter-rotating propellers). Of course, no matter the direction of the propellers, a failure of the left engine will always produce a yaw to the left, it is just bigger if the aircraft has clockwise rotation propellers.",

Learning Objective 021.10.10.01.04: Describe the function and the principle of operation of the following main components of a turbocharger: turbine; compressor; waste gate; waste-gate actuator. Piston Engines can have their power increased in three main ways, by increasing the size of the engine (displacement), increasing the RPM, or increasing the pressure of the air/fuel mixture (called the Manifold Absolute Pressure, MAP). This last case is why we might use a turbocharger in our car engines, so we can have a small, efficient engine, with extra power available from a turbocharger (which compresses the intake air) when needed. Turbochargers are arguably even more useful in aircraft, where piston engines become less powerful in the thinner air at higher altitudes. This is where turbochargers can compress that air, to make the engine operate with the same power output it would do at a much lower altitude. We call this an \"altitude boosted\" turbocharger. They are more useful to us by keeping the same power up to higher altitudes, rather than giving us lots more power on the ground, which would put a lot of strain on the engine, which would be a \"ground boosted\" turbocharger. Turbochargers (and any superchargers, really) increase the amount of air (and therefore fuel) we can ignite in the cylinders, and are measured by the MAP; the higher the MAP, the more air/fuel mixture we can burn in each power stroke. A turbocharger works by using the excess speed and pressure of the exhaust gasses to spin a turbine, which then directly spins a compressor, which compresses the fresh intake air ready for mixing with fuel and then entry into the cylinders (or sent straight into the cylinders where fuel injection takes place). All superchargers compress fresh intake air like this, but turbochargers are special types of superchargers that use the excess energy leftover in the exhaust gasses that we would not otherwise use. The turbochargers we talk about are controlled by waste-gates, which decide how much exhaust gas to divert to the turbine; if the MAP is too low (for what has been asked for), then the waste-gate will send more air to the turbine to get a faster spinning compressor, and vice-versa. The movement of the waste-gate is powered by oil pressure which is cleverly controlled by a system that measures the MAP and makes changes to the wastegate position accordingly.",

This is achieved in a timely sequence for a precise compression stroke. In order to break the gap between the sparking plug electrodes, the magnetos consist of a rotating permanent magnet surrounded by a U-shaped stator of soft iron, around which a thick primary and a thin secondary winding can be found. The thick winding (primary) is the low-tension element of the circuit and consists only of a few turns of thick wire. Whereas the thin winding (secondary) is the high-tension element of the circuit consisting of numerous thin windings that act as a step-up transformer. As a consequence of this arrangement, any electrical current in the primary circuit (thick winding) will induce a higher voltage in the secondary winding. Both windings will be supplied with alternating current from the permanent set of magnetos as they’re driven by the engine. Another important aspect you need to understand in the principle of magnetos operation is that the primary winding will be continuously broken and then restored by a contact breaker. The contact will be broken by a permanently rotating breaker cam which main task is to break the primary circuit. The reason why we need the primary circuit to get broken is that this will create a collapse in the primary’s winding magnetic field that will produce an increase in energy in the secondary winding. The second reason is that the normal AC produced in the primary winding will be converted into a series of pulses. The general outcome of this sequence of actions will result in a series of very high voltage, low current pulses of electricity that will be fed to a distributor. Distributor’s task will be then to spread these pulses through a high-tension leads to the spark-plugs.",

Therefore, less fuel is required to maintain a constant power output. So, the fuel flow will decrease, not increase. Increasing the fuel flow in an effort to compensate for the decrease in air density would result in an over-rich mixture and potentially cause engine damage. What exactly do they mean by “maintaining the same power setting”? We believe it is referring to the amount of power the pilot is requesting from the engine, not the actual power output of the engine. In order to maintain the same power setting, the pilot will likely have to lean the mixture (decrease the fuel flow) to compensate for the decrease in air density at higher altitude. So, even though the pilot is requesting the same amount of power, the engine will produce less power due to the decrease in air density, and the fuel flow will decrease to match the decrease in oxygen available. Note: We are deciding that \"power setting\" means constant RPM/MAP for this question. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam.",

At a positive angle of attack and when viewed from the rear, the thrust line of a clockwise rotating propeller is displaced to the right of the engine centre line because the down going blade generates more thrust than the up going blade. Therefore, if both engines rotate clockwise, the right engine will have a longer thrust arm than the left engine. Thus, if the left engine fails, the thrust of the right engine acts through a longer thrust arm and will give a bigger yawing moment. The critical engine is the engine, the failure of which would give the biggest yawing moment. Consequently, we can safely say that with clockwise rotating propellers, the critical engine is the left one. The aircraft has the natural tendency to swing its nose into the wind in response to a sideslip (left wind results in left yaw). This will add to the already existent tendency to yaw towards the left due to the left engine failure and will increase the difficulty to control and the need for a larger rudder deflection.

It is used for \"auxiliary\" purposes, mostly on the ground, such as running the air conditioning system, pressurising the hydraulic system and most importantly, providing an air source to start the main engines when a GPU (Ground Power Unit) is not available. A ground power unit (GPU) is an external unit that provides either electricity to an aircraft (so it does not need to use its own batteries) or a pneumatic air source for air conditioning and starting engines. Jet engines require quite a lot of initial engine input to start up, as the compressors need to spinning quite rapidly to allow stable continuous combustion. There are two main ways to provide this energy, air starting and electrical. Air starting utilises the pneumatic supply in an aircraft, which is usually the most powerful system. This is the reason than most aircraft main engines can only be air started. Electrical starting requires a powerful, very fast spinning starter motor (and a lot of available electricity), so is usually only able to start the much smaller APU engine. There is an exception to this rule, the Boeing 787 actually has such a powerful electrical system, it also uses electrical starting for its main engines. Specifically for APUs, they are meant to be used to start the main engines when a GPU is not available, meaning that they need to be able to start themselves off the aircraft's stored energy alone. Therefore, the APU must be able to start off batteries only, if required. The APU can also be started off GPU electricity, as not to drain the on-board batteries. Air starting of the APU depends on the aircraft. The Boeing 737 can only electrically start its APU, but the Boeing 777 is capable of starting its APU from electricity (from GPU or Battery) and also air-starting (from GPU or main engine bleed-air). The RAT (ram air turbine) is a little wind turbine that drops out of the aircraft to provide hydraulic pressure and even electricity if there are no other electrical or hydraulic sources available on the aircraft. This is to use essential items such as the flight controls in case of a multiple engine and electrical failure. It is not nearly powerful enough to start an engine, and the APU is also not hydraulically started anyway.",

It captures the required air mass flow and delivers it to the compressor at the correct design speed. That’s why the intake is slightly divergent in order to reduce the airflow’s velocity (=dynamic pressure) and increase the static pressure and temperature just before the fan and compressor’s first stages. Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers.",

Axial gas turbine engine compressors are made up of a set of spinning compressor blades and static \"stator vanes\". They direct a complex dance of very accurately placed airflow, and have the job of increasing pressure gradually, but over many stages, until the pressure is many times higher than ambient. Similar to a wing or propeller blade, the incoming airflow onto each blade matters a lot, and each blade has an optimum angle of attack, as well as less-than optimum angles of attack, and stalled angles of attack. The angle of attack is based on the incoming airflow and the rotational speed of that section of blade. If a blade section stalls, then it is no longer able to accomplish its job of increasing the pressure, and it can have a knock-on effect onto other blades and the later stages of the compressor. Compressor stalls are most common at low RPM and during engine RPM changes, so acceleration and deceleration. Eventually, if this disrupts enough blades, the whole airflow within the engine can become disrupted, and the backwards pressure gradient from the combustion chamber will overpower the compressor, causing a surge. A surge is a complete breakdown of the airflow through the engine, and often results in a reversal of the airflow in the engine, as the compressor is no longer managing to keep the back pressure from the combustion chamber at bay. Therefore, we need to make sure that the airflow always hits the compressor blades in the correct way. We do this initially by using inlet guide vanes (IGVs) or variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs), which sit in front of the first LP compressor stage, and have their angle set to make sure the air hits the compressor blades correctly. After this point, stalls could still occur, so variable stator vanes (VSVs) can be used between compressor stages to make sure the airflow is pointing in exactly the correct direction onto the next compressor stage. Even later than this, during the start sequence (when the compressor is most likely to stall) we can use bleed air outlets just after the compressor to let out excess pressure, which reduces the overall backwards pressure gradient force causing a stall.",

VENT/DRAIN VALVE In a gas turbine engine combustion chamber, the fuel and air mixture usually burn at the chemically correct mixture, in order to burn hotter and more efficiently, in theory burning all of the fuel perfectly. Sometimes, however, there can be deposits of unburnt fuel that build up on the walls of the combustion chamber, which will need to drain from the engine somehow. A much more common usage of a vent/drain valve is after a \"wet start\", where a start malfunction has occured that stopped the engine from igniting the fuel, and the fuel has been sprayed out of the nozzles but not burned, so is now sat in the bottom of the combustion chamber. This situation could be made very dangerous if the engine is started again, this time with a pool of fuel at the bottom, and could lead to a \"hot start\", with the potential for large flames to be sent out of the back of the engine. This could also overheat the turbine, as there is not enough cooling airflow during start to counteract the large fire. In aircraft with no vent/drain valve, the pilots would usually run the starter without running the igniters to blow the fuel away, but a vent/drain valve is much easier and can drain the fuel out of the combustion chamber quickly and safely. Note: we would usually refer to this as a drain valve, and so do EASA, but in this question, the feedback says that they have called it a \"vent valve\", which is the same thing.",

            "explanation": "Both statements are correct. The intake geometry is designed to take full advantage of the ram effect. It captures the required air mass flow and delivers it to the compressor at the correct design speed. That’s why the intake is slightly divergent in order to reduce the airflow’s velocity (=dynamic pressure) and increase the static pressure and temperature just before the fan and compressor’s first stages. Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers.",

In nowadays commercial aircraft, the FADEC controls the start valve electrically and operates it pneumatically with bleed air. Ignition ON: the igniters are selected ON and are ready to light the mixture. High-pressure fuel ON: after fuel is delivered by the high-pressure shut-off valve (HPSOV) it is sprayed into the combustion chamber by fuel nozzles under high-pressure where it is mixed with compressed air and lights up. Light-up: the mixture starts burning and the flame spreads all along with the combustion chamber (since it is interconnected). The flame becomes self-sustainable. Self-sustaining speed: all the engine’s spools have reached a self-sustaining speed where assistance from the air starter is not needed anymore. The air starter is disengaged by the coupling between engine N2 spool and starter by the use of centrifugal forces. Starter circuit canceled. As you can see, ignition occurs just before fuel is supplied to the combustion chamber. If you think about it, it makes sense to have already the spark before supplying the fuel. If the spark is supplied after the fuel is being delivered, some fuel will be unburnt and will accumulate at the bottom of the combustion chamber case and would potentially result in a wet start.",

            "explanation": "A gas turbine engine-free turbine does not drive a compressor, i.e. there’s no mechanical connection between the compressor and the power output shaft. The energy delivered by the free turbine stages is only dependent on the rotational speed of the HP spool. In this configuration, the engine will simply act as a gas generator to supply high-energy gases to an independent free power turbine driving a propeller or rotor via a reduction gearbox. This is why this type of turbine is often used on turboprop engines and helicopters. In fact, there will be two major assemblies: one shaft known as the HP spool and connecting the compressor and the compressor-driving turbine, and a free turbine placed after the compressor-driving turbine that is connected to a propeller. Because these two assemblies are not interconnected in any way, the propeller and free turbine assembly will be able to rotate at an independent speed from that of the HP spool. The most suitable control system for a turboprop fitted with a free turbine is the direct control of fuel flow. In this system, the gas generator (the core of the engine) is controlled in the same manner as a turbojet, and the power available to the free turbine assembly is governed by the fuel flow. For instance: If the power setting is increased (due to an increased fuel flow), the RPM of the HP spool will also increase and the axial airflow will be momentarily lagging, causing the EGT to increase. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by increasing the propeller’s blade angle. If the power setting is decreased, the RPM of the HP spool and the EGT will also decrease. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by decreasing the propeller’s blade angle.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.11.03.05.04: Explain the different modes of operation of the ignition system. Gas turbine engines are different from piston engines in many ways, one of which is their continuous nature. Whilst the intake, compression, combustion and exhaust cycle happens intermittently, many times per second in a piston engine, it is a continuous cycle in a gas turbine engine. This means that the flame(s) in the combustion chamber(s) should never go out from starting up to shutting down. Sometimes, conditions can occur which bring the engine close to a \"flame-out\", which is where the flame in the engine is extinguished, and the engine will likely begin to slow down, with no flame to keep it alive. This situation can be stopped by using continuous ignition, where low power igniters run many times per minute to re-ignite the fuel/air mixture instantly if the flame goes out. These do not need to be the same extremely high voltage sparks as used during start-up, as the engine is already running, they just need to be enough to re-light the fuel quickly to keep the engine running. When the engines are running, continuous ignition can be selected either manually by the flight crew or automatically by the FADEC to maintain engine combustion. The FADEC will automatically turn ON continuous ignition when the engine anti-ice is ON, maximum/flex thrust is selected, idle thrust is selected during approach, or a thrust control malfunction is detected (risk of flame-out), etc. On some aircraft, it can even be automatically activated when the stall warning system/stick shaker alerts of an impending stall. The flight crew will manually select continuous ignition when passing through a heavy precipitation area, moderate or severe turbulence, high ambient air temperatures, or anytime a lack of sufficient airflow or fuel into the engine is expected.

            "explanation": "Older single spool turbojet engines did not have any bypass air. All the air that enters the engine goes directly through every compressor stage (except any bleed air), then is combusted, and passes through the turbine and the exhaust. This type of engine relies on the speed and excess pressure of the exhaust gas to provide thrust. It accelerates a small amount of air up to a high speed. This does lose a lot of energy to heat, friction, noise and other inefficiencies. More modern jet engines are called turbofans, because of the big fan at the front. They use a bypass design, where only some of the inlet air passes through the core of the engine (compressor, combustion chamber and turbine), but most of the air actually goes around the core of the engine, blown by the front fan only. This has many benefits over the single spool turbojet design, particularly at lower speeds. This type of engine accelerates a large amount of air (high mass flow) up by a smaller amount (lower velocity). This means that there are less hot exhaust gasses, and that the noise is reduced, as well as there being extra cooling, so the combustion can burn hotter. For commercial aviation, high bypass engines are much more efficient. A lower specific fuel consumption means that less fuel is used to produce the same amount of thrust. Lower SFC means higher efficiency",

You could argue that statement 2 is incorrect because of this, but we think that it is more correct than incorrect, and our feedback shows it to be considered correct in the exam. Not all the air that flows through the compressor will get mixed with fuel and burned in the combustion chamber.

            ],
            "explanation": "\"1. The maximum thrust increases as the pressure altitude decreases.\" CORRECT. As altitude increases, the air gets thinner. The increase in altitude causes a decrease in pressure, thus a decrease in density and corresponding decrease in thrust – since less air is entering the gas turbine engine. As altitude decreases, the air gets thicker. The decrease in altitude causes an increase in pressure, thus an increase in density and corresponding increase in thrust – since more air is entering the gas turbine engine. \"2. The specific fuel consumption is proportional to pressure altitude, at constant TAS.\" INCORRECT. Specific fuel consumption reduces proportionally to the temperature => If temperature is decreasing, specific fuel consumption decreases. That being said, specific fuel consumption depends on temperature and not on pressure altitude. Thus saying that \"the specific fuel consumption is proportional to pressure altitude, at constant TAS\" is vague because, even though normally temperature increases with reducing pressure altitude, there can be inversions. Anyhow, we assume standard conditions => temperature decreasing with increasing pressure altitude => specific fuel consumption, therefore, decreases with increasing pressure altitude (inversely proportional).",

            "explanation": "Note: This is similar to question 215432, but with different options. This question is less commonly reported, and sometimes with slight differences, so it may be slightly different in the exam. A gas turbine engine requires a lot of energy to start. This is mostly in the form of getting the compressor rotating to a speed where it can feed enough air into the combustion chamber to run self-sufficiently. For this, compressors can be spun up in two ways, electrically or by air starter (pneumatic). Electric starting is as it sounds, an electric starter motor runs for the compressor to get up to speed. This used to be reserved for small turbine engines only, and the APUs (Auxiliary Power Units) of larger aircraft, so they can be started from battery power. However, the B787 uses a very high power electrical system, and can start its large main engines using electrical starter generators. This is not a usual method of starting large engines, so we believe the examiner is not talking about it. The more common method (for large engines) is via air starters, which shoot high pressure air at a certain place within the engine compressor, which gets the compressor spinning fast enough to run the engine itself. The source of this high pressure air is the aircraft's pneumatic system, and the 3 places this air can come from are the APU bleed air, from a ground cart that is connected to the aircraft, or from the other main engine's bleed air, if it is running. It is also important to note that even an air start needs electrical power to feed the engine igniters and often the electronic engine controllers that control the engines. This has to come from a source. Lets go through each option: \"From an APU and RAM air turbine.\" The RAM air turbine (RAT) is never used for engine starting. \"From two external power sources and/or an APU.\" We see this as the most correct answer. The APU alone is enough to start the main engines, providing AC/DC power and pneumatic air. Also, the aircraft can be connected to a GPU (ground power unit providing AC power) and an air cart at once (2 external sources), which would mean that the engines can be started without needing the APU at all. \"From two external sources only.\" The APU can start the engines with no external power source. \"From two batteries or an APU generator.\" Most jet engines cannot be started from electrical power alone.",

Some of the most common oil-related issues in any engine, including turbine engines, are lack of oil flow, usually due to lack of oil, leaks, blockages, faulty pumps, etc. In this case, the oil pressure will drop in the engine, and, because less oil is flowing around the engine (and especially in the case of low oil quantity, leaks, etc.), the oil remaining will still take as much heat from the engine, but will less ability for cooling, meaning that the oil will heat up until the oil temperature is too high. This is why low oil pressure so often coincides with high oil temperature, and this occurrence is probably the most common oil-related issue in piston and turbine engines. Certainly, when the ENG OIL PRESS warning shows, the likelihood is that lack of oil flow is the cause, and therefore the above scenario will take place.",

The mounting connecting the blades at their root is of the ‘fir tree’ type. The blades are subject to very high centrifugal loads and high-temperature variations that unavoidably cause thermal expansion of the blades. That’s why they are fitted on a disk or drum using a ‘loose fit’ design that will avoid them blocking in their mounting under high thermal loads and vibrations. The ‘fir tree’ root connection allows the blades to be loosely fitted and to be replaced more easily, as each blade has its own independent connection to the rotor disk. The loose fit gives the rotor blades some room for expansion. Sometimes when the aircraft is on the ground and a strong wind is blowing towards the engine and keeps it rotating along with the compressor (the engine is windmilling) you will be able to hear a clicking noise. This is due to the rotor blades being loose in their mounting on the drum without any centrifugal loads acting on them.",

            "explanation": "\"I. A compressor stall is most likely to occur in a compressor designed for a high pressure ratio operating at low RPM.\" CORRECT A compressor stall occurs when there is an imbalance between the air flow supply and the airflow demand - in other words, a pressure ratio that is incompatible with the engine RPM. As a result, smooth airflow is interrupted and pressure fluctuations are created within the turbine. It occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack (just like a wing). Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing a stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. \"II. A compressor stall is most likely to occur when the air flow stagnates in the front stages of the compressor.\" INCORRECT As mentioned above, air stagnates in the REAR stages, which results in a lack of air in the FRONT stages with subsequent low axial velocity in front stages. This will lead to a high angle of attack of the rotor blades determining a STALL. To avoid such situation, turbine engines are fitted with VIGV (variable inlet guide vanes) and VSV (variable stator vanes) that ensure correct airflow through the stages of the engine.",

The FADEC has a dual channels Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for redundancy, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. In addition to the ECU, all the FADEC peripherals such as actuators, solenoids, electrical wiring, sensors, and fuel metering are also part of the FADEC system and are used for control and monitoring. The system has a three-phase permanent magnetic alternator for an internal power source. This independent alternator is also the electrical power source for all the FADEC sensors as well as the ECUs. By interfacing with other aircraft systems and its own engine sensors, the FADEC system provides the following functions: Automatic thrust rating control. Engine operation within safe limits. Fully automatic engine starting. Thrust Reverser Control. Engine overspeed and/or an EGT protection function. Engine monitoring and help for maintenance and troubleshooting. To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic. All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual, with the exception of some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating (that are single). To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link. Therefore, if one input parameter fails to be delivered, the input parameter from the other channel will be used to allow the correct computation of the engine parameters by the FADEC. This means that the FADEC is a single fault-tolerant, and it will ensure the efficient and correct running of the engine even in case of a detected malfunction.",

The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range, and the power lever positions corresponding to the ALPHA range are between flight idle and maximum power. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust).

The main feature of them is that the power output shaft (to the rotors or propeller) is not physically connected to any part of the \"gas generator\", which is the set of compressors fed by the normal turbines. Instead of linking the propeller to one of the standard turbine spools, an extra turbine is added to the engine after the standard turbines, which absorbs most of the remaining energy to use solely for the turning of the propeller, before the air gets sent out of the exhaust. This means that the propeller can be governed to go at any speed the pilots requires, which will mean that the free-power turbine will also have to go at the corresponding speed (they are connected via a reduction gearbox to go from the turbine's 50 000-ish RPM to the propeller's 2000-ish RPM), but without making the rest of the engine components go at that speed, allowing the standard turbine-compressor spools (known as the \"gas generator\") to stay at their optimum speed, where they can be most efficient, and longer lasting. The engine (gas generator) then becomes far simpler to operate as well, as it is almost self regulating in its speeds, etc. with no outside influence. All we do is harness the left-over pressure and velocity of the air - of which there should be plenty - to put through our propellers. There must be a constant speed unit to regulate propeller RPM, and particular care must be paid to over-torquing the engine. Therefore, just like a normal gas turbine engine, you have: Intake - Compressor - Combustion Chamber - Turbine - Exhaust However, you now have two separate sets of turbines, one set which drives the compressor (gas generator turbines) and the free-power turbine which takes the left over energy and turns the propeller with it. It therefore becomes: Intake - Compressor(5) - Combustion Chamber(3) - Gas Generator Turbine(1) - Free-Power Turbine(4) - Exhaust(2). 5-3-1-4-2",

            "explanation": "FADEC stands for Full Authority Digital Engine Control and is basically a digital control system mounted on the engine’s fan case, that performs the entire engine management tasks. The FADEC has a dual channels Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for redundancy, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. In addition to the ECU, all the FADEC peripherals such as actuators, solenoids, electrical wiring, sensors, and fuel metering are also part of the FADEC system and are used for control and monitoring. The system has a three-phase permanent magnetic alternator for an internal power source. This independent alternator is also the electrical power source for all the FADEC sensors as well as the ECUs. By interfacing with other aircraft systems and its own engine sensors, the FADEC system provides the following functions: Automatic thrust rating control. Engine operation within safe limits. Fully automatic engine starting. Thrust Reverser Control. Engine overspeed and/or an EGT protection function. Engine monitoring and help for maintenance and troubleshooting. To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic. All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual, with the exception of some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating (that are single). To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link. Therefore, if one input parameter fails to be delivered, the input parameter from the other channel will be used to allow the correct computation of the engine parameters by the FADEC. This means that the FADEC is a single fault-tolerant, and it will ensure the efficient and correct running of the engine even in case of a detected malfunction.",

Through the Constant Speed Unit, the propeller controls the power output by varying the propeller blade pitch angle to maintain engine rpm. The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce a minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

Ignition ON: the igniters are selected ON and are ready to light the mixture. High-pressure fuel ON: after fuel is delivered by the high-pressure shut-off valve (HPSOV) it is sprayed into the combustion chamber by fuel nozzles under high-pressure where it is mixed with compressed air and lights up. Light-up: the mixture starts burning and the flame spreads all along with the combustion chamber (since it is interconnected). The flame becomes self-sustainable. Self-sustaining speed: all the engine’s spools have reached a self-sustaining speed where assistance from the air starter is not needed anymore. The air starter is disengaged by the coupling between engine N2 spool and starter by the use of centrifugal forces. Starter circuit canceled.",

The increase in altitude causes a decrease in pressure, thus a decrease in density and a corresponding decrease in thrust – since less air is entering the gas turbine engine. “2. The specific fuel consumption decreases slightly as the pressure altitude increases at constant TAS.” CORRECT. Specific fuel consumption varies proportionally to the temperature => If the temperature is increasing, specific fuel consumption increases. Assuming standard conditions => temperature decreasing with increasing pressure altitude => specific fuel consumption decreases with increasing pressure altitude (inversely proportional).",

Each set of rotor-stator sequence is called a stage. The transition between the rotors and the stators is shaped into a divergent duct in order to convert the kinetic energy of the airflow into pressure energy. Because of the small pressure increase at each compressor stage, numerous stages are required to achieve the desired delivery pressure at the combustion chamber. Each compressor stage consists of rotor blades followed by a row of stator blades and will provide a pressure ratio of about 1.1 or 1.2:1.",

The energy delivered by the free turbine stages is only dependent on the rotational speed of the HP spool. In this configuration, the engine will simply act as a gas generator to supply high-energy gases to an independent free power turbine driving a propeller or rotor via a reduction gearbox. This is why this type of turbine is often used on turboprop engines and helicopters. In fact, there will be two major assemblies: one shaft known as the HP spool and connecting the compressor and the compressor-driving turbine, and a free turbine placed after the compressor-driving turbine that is connected to a propeller. Because these two assemblies are not interconnected in any way, the propeller and free turbine assembly will be able to rotate at an independent speed from that of the HP spool. The most suitable control system for a turboprop fitted with a free turbine is the direct control of fuel flow. In this system, the gas generator (the core of the engine) is controlled in the same manner as a turbojet, and the power available to the free turbine assembly is governed by the fuel flow. For instance: If the power setting is increased (due to an increased fuel flow), the RPM of the HP spool will also increase and the axial airflow will be momentarily lagging, causing the EGT to increase. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by increasing the propeller’s blade angle. If the power setting is decreased, the RPM of the HP spool and the EGT will also decrease.

Specific fuel consumption varies proportionally to the temperature => If the temperature is increasing, specific fuel consumption increases.

The accessory units of a turbo-jet engine auxiliary gearbox are the following: AC generator through its constant speed drive (CSD), Oil pumps, Hydraulic pumps, High-pressure fuel pumps.

Sometimes, however, there can be deposits of unburnt fuel that build up on the walls of the combustion chamber, which will need to drain from the engine somehow. A much more common usage of a vent/drain valve is after a \"wet start\", where a start malfunction has occurred that stopped the engine from igniting the fuel, and the fuel has been sprayed out of the nozzles but not burned, so is now sat in the bottom of the combustion chamber. This situation could be made very dangerous if the engine is immediately started again, this time with a pool of fuel at the bottom, and could lead to a \"hot start\", with the potential for large flames to be sent out of the back of the engine. This could also overheat the turbine if there is not enough cooling airflow during start to counteract the large fire. In aircraft with no vent/drain valve, the pilots would usually run the starter without running the igniters to blow the fuel away, but in the vast majority of engines, a vent/drain valve is fitted, and automatically drains the fuel from the area. This is much easier and can drain the fuel out of the combustion chamber quickly and safely. Seen as the question mentions the pilot has waited a while, we have no problems saying that the fuel should have drained by that point, and therefore the next start should be uneventful.",

Free turbine engine here refers to free-turbine turboshaft which is a form of turboshaft or turboprop gas turbine engine where the power is extracted from the exhaust stream of a gas turbine by an independent turbine, downstream of the gas turbine. The power turbine is not mechanically connected to the turbines that drive the compressors, hence the term \"free\", referring to the independence of the power output shaft (or spool). This is opposed to the power being extracted from the turbine/compressor shaft via a gearbox. Note: We placed this question in this sub-section since it is about propeller properties. How the power is generated is not very relevant.",

            "explanation": "Impulse turbines use a convergent duct in the NGV to accelerate the airflow first, then use the \"water wheel\" bucket style design of the turbine to turn that fast airflow the other way. This is a change in momentum, called an impulse. We would say that this is a prime example of Newton's third law in action, as there really isn't much else going on. Reaction turbines use much simpler (non convergent) NGVs, which direct the airflow at the proper angle into the turbine blades, which then turn and accelerate the air through convergent blades, which produces the majority of the turbine movement. The angle of the airflow on the turbine blades provides some of the turning force on the turbine, but the majority appears to come from the aerodynamic effects of the aerofoil shape as well as the converging section, which trades the high pressure for velocity, providing quite a good axial flow design for a multi-stage turbine. In reality, all gas turbine engines use a combination impulse-reaction turbine these days, as it is better to mix the two. Note: The correct answer is not verified for this question yet, and whilst we believe the aerofoil answer is certainly most correct, it would be easy to choose the answer about Newton's third law, either due to mixing the two types up, by the name \"reaction\", or simply due to the fact that everything obeys Newton's third law, however, the reaction type turbine blades are not \"based on it\" like impulse type turbines are.",

A compressor stall is a phenomenon that can happen in a gas turbine engine where some sort of local disruption of airflow occurs, and causes a change in the aerodynamics of the compressor. It is so named, because it is usually made up of the individual compressor blades stalling. This can vary in its effect on the engine, from a transient stall that has no major effect, to a stall that spreads to other turbine blades and stages, causing a full surge of the compressor, when it can no longer maintain the high pressure gradient from inlet to combustion chamber. The disruption of airflow in a compressor stall reduces the cooling airflow into the turbine (the point in the engine closest to its maximum temperature), causing a rise in TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature), both before the turbine stage (TIT - Turbine Inlet Temperature) and between the individual turbines (ITT - Interstage Turbine Temperature). Alongside these temperature rises (which could cause the temperature limits to be exceeded, the RPM of the turbines/compressors will fluctuate, and the EPR (engine pressure ratio) will drop, as the engine is no longer working optimally. A compressor stall can cause pops or bangs to be heard from the cabin, particularly if it leads to a surge, which is a full breakdown of the airflow through the compressor, often requiring the engine to be brought down to idle in order to fix the problem. None of the other options in this question would cause fluctuations and pops/bangs, only severe damage, shutdown, or maybe constant RPM (in the case of a FADEC control unit failure).",

This further induces a subsequent low axial velocity in front stages and will lead to a high angle of attack of the rotor blades determining a STALL (at the front stages first). Usually, this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. That’s why the tapped excessive pressure is relieved by means of a bleed valve that will open at the front stages and recirculate the bleed air towards the air conditioning unit and other systems. This is determined by the engine operating regime so that any unwanted rise in air pressure can be relieved and prevent the conditions which will cause a surge.",

In fact, it can only be controlled and minimized properly by using the right and precise control method. Basically, FOD is known as foreign object (FO) that can cause severity and destruction to the aircraft such as engine failure and loss of human life. FOD is a severe hazard for gas turbine engines, as solid objects can cause serious structural damage that can lead to disintegration and even fire. The RPM is very high, and there is a large momentum of moving parts, so a collision with solid objects releases a lot of impact energy. The indications of FOD ingestion would be: \"NO N1 Rotation\"; \"NO N2 Rotation\"; \"NO Fuel Flow\"; \"High EGT\"; \"High Oil TEMP\"; \"LOW Oil Pressure\"; \"High Vibration\". In this case, NO 2 (right engine) has ingested FOD. To further confirm this, a large yawing moment to the right, possibly indicates a right engine failure.",

It captures the required air mass flow and delivers it to the compressor at the correct design speed. That’s why the intake is slightly divergent in order to reduce the airflow’s velocity (=dynamic pressure) and increase the static pressure and temperature just before the fan and compressor’s first stages. Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers.",

Stall represents a partial breakdown of airflow within the engine, while surge indicates a complete breakdown. Compressor stall typically progresses, starting from a single blade and potentially affecting an entire stage before spreading to the entire engine if unaddressed. Ultimately, this progression leads to surge, potentially causing an instantaneous reversal of engine gases, often accompanied by a loud noise. Indicators of stall include heightened engine vibration and increased exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The rise in EGT results from reduced airflow to the combustion chambers, limiting the cooling effect on exhaust gases. Signs of surge encompass: Loud noise; RPM fluctuations; Significant increase in EGT, and a resultant loss of thrust that may cause the aircraft to yaw. If surge occurs, it's crucial to gradually close the throttle of the affected engine.",

Turbine engines operate with very fine margins, and contain incredible heat and immense rotational speeds. They are, however, still reliant on the outside air for their oxygen, without which they cannot burn fuel. When the outside air is colder, or when the aircraft is at low altitudes, they are very powerful, as there is plenty of air available to compress and then burn. Of course, at higher altitudes and/or in warmer air, the air is less dense, so the engine has to work harder to produce the same thrust output, and therefore has a lower maximum thrust. There is a second effect of extra heat in the air though, and that is on the turbine. The turbine is the most highly stressed area of a gas turbine engine, and is also located in the hottest section of the engine. That means that there is a maximum Turbine Gas Temperature (TGT) that cannot be exceeded, as the turbine blades could become permanently deformed. When the air outside is hotter, there is a certain point at which the TGT becomes the limiting factor to how much thrust the engine can produce, and this is usually around the region of ISA +15°C. As the OAT gets hotter than that, the engine thrust continues to reduce, as we are not able to burn as hot, without potentially damaging the turbine blades. We call this the \"temperature limited\" or \"TGT limited\" range. Below this range is the \"flat-rated range\", and the temperature where the two ranges meet is the flat rated temperature. In this range, the air is cool enough to be limited by the maximum mass flow of the engine, rather than by any temperature considerations. For summary; OAT below the flat rated temperature = flat rated OAT above the flat rated temperature = temperature limited.",

Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. In Conclusion: In a convergent duct, flow speed increases, increasing dynamic pressure (= velocity). If dynamic pressure increases, static pressure and static temperature decrease. In a divergent duct, flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (=velocity). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure and static temperature increase.",

Upon recognition of the hung start conditions, the flight crew needs to shut down the engine, conduct a cranking and initiate a cooling sequence before attempting a new engine start. Hot start – usually caused by an early starter cut-out, fuel mis-scheduling (leading to excess fuel in the combustor), or strong tailwinds. Intermittent light-up at very low rpm (sub-idle) will be observed, followed by a very sudden increase in EGT. That’s why EGT monitoring is one of the most important parameters to monitor during the engine start sequence, which will allow you to abort the start immediately. Dry start – fuel fails to be delivered to the engine and light-up will not take place. The compressor will only reach a given RPM (rather low) because it will be driven only by the starter motor.",

When the combustion gases pass through the turbine, the pressure drops. The higher the temperature resulting from combustion, the greater the gas expansion and energy transfer to the turbine. However, because the materials used in the turbine assembly are temperature limited, temperature limitations are usually imposed on the turbine section to avoid its complete damage. Creep is the permanent and cumulative physical extension of a component under loads. The extend of the creep is mostly affected by the temperature and the centrifugal loadings, where the higher the temperature the greater the amount of creep. Therefore, the VSV system, the blades, and their rotors (where the creep phenomenon is the most severe) must be cooled to permit them to withstand the high turbine entry temperatures.",

Therefore the correct answer is: “reduce the tendency to compressor stall” The other answers are incorrect: “spill compressor air should the engine overspeed thus controlling the speed.”: If the engine is in a overspeed conditions, removing air inside the compressor will only work against the objective. The compressor is having to force air backwards and pressurize it into the combustion chamber which requires a large amount of force. Removing the air will remove that force required and make the compressor turn even faster. “enable an external air supply to spin up the compressor for engine starting.”: Although this may seem correct, remember that the engine can be started with the use of bleed air and the air starter that is connected to the accessory box. Therefore bleed air from an APU, another engine, or a GPU will never enter the engine itself. “control the acceleration time of the engine.”: The acceleration of the engine is controlled with the fuel flow.

The pressure can get so high that the airflow in the compressor stage gets reversed. The reversal of airflow causes the angle of attack of the compressor blades to exceed their maximum, which further worsens the surge. To avoid this, modern engine have a FADEC unit which accurately interprets the pilots input and safely translates this to outputs of the engine, such as fuel flow. This prevents a flooding of the combustion chamber during hard accelerations.

            "explanation": "The oil to fuel heat exchanger is a really smart system invented to save energy and prevent complexity in aircraft. Aircraft very commonly fly at thirty to forty thousand feet where temperature can reach as low as -57°C, now considering that Jet A-1 freezes at roughly -47°C, we know we have to create a system that keep the fuel warm and therefore liquid. Now we could install electric heaters but they would add extra load on the accessory gearbox of the engines and thus increase fuel burn. We could also use bleed air but that would again decrease the effectiveness of the engine requiring a higher fuel flow. At the same time, we have oil flowing through an engine that reaches temperatures of 1700°C that needs to be cooled. So we could install radiators around the engine to exchange the heat from the oil with the cold outside air but that would create extra drag and therefore increase fuel burn. Instead, we could connect both systems and prevent any waste of energy and prevent the operators of the aircraft to have to car for another component/system in an already complex aircraft. What we are left with is a system that cools the oil and heats the fuel at the same time. The other answers are incorrect: “fuel is cooled to prevent vapour locking interrupting the fuel supply to the nozzles.”: Fuel is heated to prevent freezing “oil is heated through thermal exchange with the fuel.”: Oil is cooled and fuel is heated. They are performing a thermal exchange but it’s the opposite of the statement. “fuel is heated as required whenever fuel filter clogging is detected.”: The system is constantly running, it does not only turn on when clogging is detected.",

Through the Constant Speed Unit, the propeller controls the power output by varying the propeller blade pitch angle to maintain engine rpm. The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range, and the power lever positions corresponding to the ALPHA range are between flight idle and maximum power. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

The axial compressor increases the air's kinetic energy and then converts it into pressure energy. It consists of a series of aerofoil section blades, called rotors, mounted on a rotating rotor disc, which accelerate the air towards stationary stator blades. Each set of rotors and stators is known as a stage. An axial flow compressor comprises many stages, with each stage typically providing a pressure rise of about 10% to 20% (1.1 to 1.2:1). The pressure rise per stage is kept small to prevent blade stalling and excessive drag. Consequently, an axial flow compressor requires multiple stages to achieve a usable compression level. Axial flow compressors generally achieve pressure ratios of 35:1 to as high as 50:1.",

The answer is somewhat misleading, but we believe it is the most correct, although it is not verified. Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or send it by email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can verify the question, thank you! A gas turbine engine requires a lot of energy to start. This is mostly in the form of getting the compressor rotating to a speed where it can feed enough air into the combustion chamber to run self-sufficiently. For this, compressors can be spun up in two ways, electrically or by air starter (pneumatic). Electric starting is as it sounds, an electric starter motor runs for the compressor to get up to speed. This used to be reserved for small turbine engines only, and the APUs (Auxiliary Power Units) of larger aircraft, so they can be started from battery power. However, the B787 uses a very high power electrical system, and can start its main engines using electrical starter generators. This is not a usual method of starting large engines, so we believe the examiner is not talking about it. The more common method (for large engines) is via air starters, which shoot high pressure air at a certain place within the engine compressor, which gets the compressor spinning fast enough to run the engine itself. The source of this high pressure air is the aircraft's pneumatic system, and the 3 places this air can come from are the APU bleed air, from a ground cart that is connected to the aircraft, or from the other main engine's bleed air, if it is running. To go through each answer: \"two external sources or other engines.\" Correct. Whilst this is somewhat misleading (what is considered to be an external source?), the sources for engine air starting are the other engine(s), the APU and a ground cart, which you could class as two \"external sources\". We think it is very much debatable, and that the examiner should not write questions in this way, to deliberately mislead the students. \"two batteries or the APU generator.\" Notwithstanding the Boeing 787, large turbine engines (the main engines of jets) are not electrically started. \"the APU and RAM air turbine.\" The RAM air turbine (RAT) is never used for engine starting. \"the APU, RAM air turbine or ground power unit.\" The RAM air turbine (RAT) is never used for engine starting. The ground power unit (GPU) would be correct, as they provide pneumatic air to start the engines (ground cart).",

This includes many protections and controls, such as fully automatic starting, engine overspeed protection, engine monitoring/troubleshooting, etc. FADEC was initially just used in gas turbine engines for the aviation industry, but modern piston engines are now being controlled in this way too.",

They come in two forms: Axial compressor Centrifugal compressor The axial compressor is usually found on traditional jet engine that have axial flow. Each stage of the compressor usually increases the pressure by 1.2, but as there are many stages, the pressure after an entire compressor section is usually much higher than the single stage. Due to their design which allows flow to continue flowing in the same direction, axial compressors allow for more mass flow than a centrifugal compressor. The centrifugal compressor is usually found on turboshaft engine, such as those powering turbo propellor aircraft or turbine helicopters. In the diagram you can see that instead of compressing the air coming into the compressor backwards, the centrifugal compressor works by pressing air outwards compared to the axis of the engine. The centrifugal compressor usually creates a pressure differential of 4 per stage. Unfortunately because of the change of direction of flow as you can see in the picture and the design of the compressor blades, the mass flow is reduced compared to a axial compressor. Therefore: Axial compressors have a lower ratio by stage (even if they might create a higher pressure ratio after all the stages!) Axial compressors have the ability to compress more airflow than a centrifugal compressor. Hence the correct answers are: 1, 3.",

DIFFUSER The diffuser is the divergent section of the engine after the compressor and before the combustion chamber. The diffuser increases the cross-section of the duct, for a constant mass flow, the velocity drops. This increases the static pressure of the air. Additionally, it decelerates the approx. 350 m/s flow to an approx. 50 m/s flow before fuel injection in some engines. This deceleration is crucial for optimal fuel burning conditions. It prepares the air for entry into the flame burning area of the combustion section at a lower velocity (and with much higher pressure) so that the flame of combustion can burn continuously. If the air passed through the flame area at a high velocity, it could extinguish the flame. Therefore, it stops the flame being extinguished by the high dynamic pressure of the air, by turning a lot of that into static pressure.",

Please do let us know in the comments or in the question reporting section if you see this in our real exam, and anything you can remember about it, thank you! Due to the nature of FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) systems, failures must be well protected against. This means that FADEC engines need back up systems for redundancy. This can either be achieved with a single FADEC system and a hydromechanical back up, or more commonly with a dual channel FADEC system. This makes the FADEC system 'single fault tolerant', meaning that any one fault on its own cannot stop the engine completely. However, problems such as a complete power loss to both channels would cause a full FADEC failure, but the chance of this is reduced by having separate power supplies, independent from the aircraft main electrical system in some cases. If there is a full FADEC failure with no backup, then the engine will just fail, as the fuel supply will stop. If the failure is not fixed, there will be no chance of a restart. Most FADEC engines close the fuel valve in the event of a control failure, but all the other engine controls will cease also, so the system shuts down the engine as it is better to have no thrust than uncontrollable or runaway thrust.",

As a result, smooth airflow is interrupted and pressure fluctuations are created within the turbine. It occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack (just like a wing). Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor (the LP compressor), making it stall first. Usually, this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. As mentioned above, air stagnates in the REAR stages, which results in a lack of air in the FRONT stages (LP stage) with subsequent low axial velocity in the front stages. This will lead to a high angle of attack of the rotor blades determining a STALL. That’s why the tapped excessive pressure in the rear stages is relieved by means of a bleed valve that will open at the front stages and recirculate the bleed air towards the air conditioning unit and other systems. This is determined by the engine operating regime so that any unwanted rise in air pressure can be relieved and prevent the conditions which will cause a surge.",

            "explanation": "Note: This has also been seen as a tick box question in the UK CAA exams. Learning Objective 021.11.04.01.17: Give examples of monitoring instruments of an engine. The question is asking for indicators or displays with which we can monitor the engine. This is not very specific, as an engine's performance or its health can be monitored, so we will assume both. To go through each option: 1. \"Hydraulic Pressure\" We do not know exactly what pressure they are referring to, perhaps they are referring to the hydraulic pressure from the engine driven hydraulic pump, in which case, that is not a useful way to monitor the engine health or performance, as it usually maintains a constant pressure, and there are varying demands of the hydraulic system as well. 2. \"Oil Temperature\" - Correct As with any engine, oil temperature is a vital indicator of engine health. 3. \"Chip Detector Caution Light\" - Correct A chip detector is a small magnetic probe that exists in the oil return line, before any scavenge pump and filter (if present). It will collect any small bits of ferrous material (which stick to the magnet), and if a build-up occurs, it is very indicative of internal engine damage. Some can detect a build-up remotely, without being removed, and will notify the flight deck via a light or some other indication. This is of course an engine health monitoring device. 4. \"Fuel Filter Bypass Indication\" - Incorrect The fuel filter is used to make sure no large particulate contaminants within the fuel can flow into the engines, causing damage to the components. If the fuel filter becomes blocked though, there is a bypass line that allows unfiltered fuel into the engine (It is better to have potentially contaminated fuel than no fuel at all). If the fuel filter is blocked and the bypass line has to be used, an indication of this will be sent to the flight deck, and that tells the pilots that unfiltered fuel is being used. This might require careful engine monitoring and a maintenance inspection on the ground, but in itself this is not telling us anything about the engine, so is NOT an engine monitoring indication. 5. \"Fuel Flow\" - Correct Fuel flow monitoring is used to monitor both engine health and (moreso) performance. It is also used for monitoring the engine start process. 6. \"Oil Pressure\" - Correct As with all engines, oil pressure is a vital indication for the pilots to have, as oil is required for the engine to run without causing itself serious damage. Oil pressure indications tell us that the oil pumps are working correctly. 7. \"Outside Air Temperature Display\" The OAT, whilst important to know for operations, is not a method of monitoring an engine.",

The mounting connecting the blades at their root is of the ‘fir tree’ type. The blades are subject to very high centrifugal loads and high-temperature variations that unavoidably cause thermal expansion of the blades. That’s why they are fitted on a disk or drum using a ‘loose fit’ design that will avoid them blocking in their mounting under high thermal loads and vibrations. The ‘fir tree’ root connection allows the blades to be loosely fitted and to be replaced more easily, as each blade has its own independent connection to the rotor disk. The loose fit gives the rotor blades some room for expansion. Sometimes when the aircraft is on the ground and a strong wind is blowing towards the engine and keeps it rotating along with the compressor (the engine is windmilling) you will be able to hear a clicking noise. This is due to the rotor blades being loose in their mounting on the drum without any centrifugal loads acting on them.",

This is commonly an engine bleed driven unit that is attached to the accessory unit which is connected to the high pressure compressor shaft. The starter motor will receive high pressure air from either: The auxiliary power unit (APU) A ground power unit (GPU) Another engine With that air, the starter will start turning the high pressure compressor shaft which will create airflow through the engine. Upon reaching a certain predetermined RPM, the igniters will be activated. This will happen either at the same time as the fuel or before, but never after the fuel. This is to prevent the combustion chamber from being flooded with fuel before the igniters turn on. This could lead to engine damage, a tailpipe fire, or no ignition at all with a lot of fuel left in the ignition chamber. The last step is the fuel, which will be injected into a combustion chamber that has: Good airflow (from the starter) A source of heat to ignite (igniters) These components put together allow for a successful combustion. Note: if the start were to occur during flight, the starter motor might not be required. The dynamic pressure might already be sufficient to create enough airflow through the engine to allow for a successful start. Therefore, on the ground, the correct start sequence is: “Starter, rotation, ignition, fuel” Extra: You can see in the diagram attached that the 737 can start from windmilling above 281 kt depending on the altitude, therefore no starter is required. Below 300 kt depending on the altitude, crossbleed is required from the other engine to engage the starter.",

A compressor stall is most likely to occur in a compressor designed for a high-pressure ratio operating at high RPM.\" INCORRECT A compressor stall occurs when there is an imbalance between the airflow supply and the airflow demand - in other words, a pressure ratio that is incompatible with the engine RPM. As a result, smooth airflow is interrupted and pressure fluctuations are created within the turbine. It occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack (just like a wing). Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually, this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. \"II. Compressor stall occurs when there is an imbalance between the air supply and the air demand.\" CORRECT.

Therefore this statement is incomplete and therefore incorrect! “Produces zero mechanical power since the aeroplane is not moving” As shown in statement 1 and 2, even if the aircraft is stationary it will still produce thrust due to air mass flow at the exhaust combined with the pressure differential between the intake and exhaust. However, thrust is not the same as the power. Thrust is a force, and knowing that: Power = work/time And that: Work = Force x distance We can see that if do not travel whilst producing any force, we do not create any work. And not creating any work means we produce no work over a given time, therefore not producing any power. Therefore this statement is correct! “Is independent of the outside air temperature” The mass flow is dependent on the density of the air which in turn is dependent on the outside air temperature. Therefore knowing that: F = mvj – mvi We can see that the thrust is dependent on the outside air temperature, therefore this statement is incorrect!",

The FADEC has a dual channels Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for redundancy, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. In addition to the ECU, all the FADEC peripherals such as actuators, solenoids, electrical wiring, sensors, and fuel metering are also part of the FADEC system and are used for control and monitoring. The system has a three-phase permanent magnetic alternator for an internal power source. This independent alternator is also the electrical power source for all the FADEC sensors as well as the ECUs. By interfacing with other aircraft systems and its own engine sensors, the FADEC system provides the following functions: Automatic thrust rating control. Engine operation within safe limits. Fully automatic engine starting. Thrust Reverser Control. Engine overspeed and/or an EGT protection function. Engine monitoring and help for maintenance and troubleshooting. To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic. All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual, with the exception of some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating (that are single). To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link. Therefore, if one input parameter fails to be delivered, the input parameter from the other channel will be used to allow the correct computation of the engine parameters by the FADEC. This means that the FADEC is a single fault-tolerant, and it will ensure the efficient and correct running of the engine even in case of a detected malfunction.",

If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. The ECU interfaces with many aircraft system computers, either directly, or via the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The EIU is an interface concentrator that serves as the communication link, between the aircraft systems and the FADEC. The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and thrust parameter computation. It manages the power according to two thrust modes: Autothrottle mode depending on autothrottle function generated by the auto flight system, Manual mode depending on Throttle Lever Angle (TLA). In other words, for the manual mode (when the A/THR is not active), the N1 command will be determined by the TLA and is sent to the ECU by a direct electrical wiring connection. The TLA will therefore regulate the fuel flow as the ECU processes the N1 command signal according to the TLA.",

Therefore we require any further feedback about this question that people have, and in particular would like to know what individual authorities are considering to be correct, so please share your exam experiences with us in the comments. As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct. France appear to be the outlier here. Authority Reported Answer France Correct/Incorrect Portugal Correct/Correct Hungary Correct/Correct Poland Correct/Correct Greece Correct/Correct UK Correct/Correct Austro Control Correct/Correct Impulse turbines use a convergent duct in the NGV to accelerate the airflow first, then use the \"water wheel\" bucket style design of the turbine to turn that fast airflow the other way. This is a change in momentum, called an impulse. Reaction turbines use much simpler (non convergent) NGVs, which direct the airflow at the proper angle into the turbine blades, which then turn and accelerate the air through convergent blades, which produces the majority of the turbine movement. The angle of the airflow on the turbine blades provides some of the turning force on the turbine, but the majority appears to come from the converging section (especially at high rotational speeds), which trades the high pressure for velocity. The wording of statement 1 does not make it clear if they are saying the particular angle provides some of the turning force or all of the turning force. We have assumed \"some\". The answer would change if we assumed \"all\". There is some debate about statement 2, and it is our belief that the stators (NGVs) do not use airfoil aerodynamics as they are simple guide vanes, and that the rotors do use airfoil aerodynamics, but not in the same way we are used to as pilots, and this quickly gets incredibly complex, and depends on which source you look at, so it is not useful to delve further for the ATPLs. The authorities appear to be mostly saying that the rotors (turbine blades) DO use airfoil aerodynamics. This question does not really work outside the land of ATPL theory though, because all gas turbine engines use a combination impulse-reaction turbine these days, as it is better to mix the two.",

            "explanation": "A gas turbine engine-free turbine does not drive a compressor, i.e. there’s no mechanical connection between the compressor and the power output shaft. The energy delivered by the free turbine stages is only dependent on the rotational speed of the HP spool. In this configuration, the engine will simply act as a gas generator to supply high-energy gases to an independent free power turbine driving a propeller or rotor via a reduction gearbox. This is why this type of turbine is often used on turboprop engines and helicopters. In fact, there will be two major assemblies: one shaft known as the HP spool and connecting the compressor and the compressor-driving turbine, and a free turbine placed after the compressor-driving turbine that is connected to a propeller. Because these two assemblies are not interconnected in any way, the propeller and free turbine assembly will be able to rotate at an independent speed from that of the HP spool. The most suitable control system for a turboprop fitted with a free turbine is the direct control of fuel flow. In this system, the gas generator (the core of the engine) is controlled in the same manner as a turbojet, and the power available to the free turbine assembly is governed by the fuel flow. For instance: If the power setting is increased (due to an increased fuel flow), the RPM of the HP spool will also increase and the axial airflow will be momentarily lagging, causing the EGT to increase. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by increasing the propeller’s blade angle. If the power setting is decreased, the RPM of the HP spool and the EGT will also decrease. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by decreasing the propeller’s blade angle.",

In this way, the flame is passed through the tubes to every single can, ensuring a uniform ignition. Tubo-annular combustion chamber: consists of several tubes radially disposed around the engine between the compressor and turbine section, all sitting in the same annular casing. The advantage of this evolved arrangement is that the airflow is carefully controlled and is more evenly spread over the first stage turbine. Annular combustion chamber: uses the entire annulus casing between the compressor and the turbine for combustion. This helps to provide a better thermal distribution on the HP turbine and reduce turbine wearing. For the same power output, the annular chamber length is 75% of a tubo-annular chamber of a similar diameter. Consequently, the wall area is much smaller and the amount of cooling air required to protect the flame tube wall is also reduced by approximately 15%. Combustion efficiency is increased and air pollution reduced making it the most widespread combustion chamber type on nowadays commercial jets. Annular combustion chambers are not simpler than the other options, and they do have higher maintenance costs usually.",

The increase in altitude causes a decrease in pressure, thus a decrease in density and corresponding decrease in thrust – since less air is entering the gas turbine engine. “2. The specific fuel consumption increases slightly as the pressure altitude increases at constant TAS.” INCORRECT. Specific fuel consumption reduces proportionally to the temperature => If temperature is decreasing, specific fuel consumption decreases. That being said, specific fuel consumption depends on temperature and not on pressure altitude. Thus saying that \" The specific fuel consumption increases slightly as the pressure altitude increases at constant TAS.\" is vague because, even though normally temperature increases with reducing pressure altitude, there can be inversions. Anyhow, we assume standard conditions => temperature decreasing with increasing pressure altitude => specific fuel consumption, therefore, decreases with increasing pressure altitude (inversely proportional).",

Preventing large fluctuations in the clearance can prevents stalls and surges in the engine by preventing the efficiency of a blade section to change. A blade section that has a very small clearance to the casing will produce a much stronger pressure differential than a blade section with a large clearance. The other answers are incorrect: “in order to cool the disc.”: Even though the system may help cool the blades, and the disk, it is not the task that the active clearance control system was designed for. “in order to reduce “creep” in the blades.”: Again, even though the system might help slightly cool the blades, it’s not the primary objective of the active clearance control system. Therefore the answer is incorrect. “as a method of attaching the stators and rotors to the hub of the disc.”: This answer makes no sense, it’s a cooling system to control clearance inside the engine, and therefore has nothing to do with the construction of the compressor assembly.",

Ground idle takes quite some time (more than 6 s) to accelerate from idle to full thrust, therefore, a higher power setting is used in flight which allows a spool-up time below 6 s. Logic circuits determine that the aircraft is in the air and in the approach and landing configuration to command the increase to \"Flight Idle\". The idle setting is returned to the low, or \"Ground Idle\" value after a predetermined time interval after the landing gear touchdown. Long story, short: by starting at flight idle, the engine achieves higher power settings, faster.",

Gas turbines operate at extremely high temperatures, and the hottest part of the engine is just behind the combustion chamber in the turbine. This is also one of the most highly stressed parts of the engine, and the heat alongside the high rotational speeds mean that the blades (and other components) have to be extremely strong. Also, procedures are used to make sure the engine does not suffer any damage from heating. One such procedure is the cool down, which entails running the engine at low power (ground idle) for a few minutes after landing, in order to cool the components as equally as possible, getting them to a lower temperature so the thermal shock of shutting the engine down is not as bad. The two parts that benefit most from this are the turbine blades and the engine casing. If a hot engine was shutdown, then the engine casing would cool very quickly (due to its thin construction and cooling from both inside and outside the engine), but the blades are much heavier and only get warm air inside the engine, so cool much slower. This means that the casing will shrink faster than the turbine blades, and given that there are such tight tolerances between the end of the blades and the casing itself, this could cause the seals* to be crushed, and the blade will scrape the casing and potentially seize completely. Note: this seems to be written as part of the learning objective stated above, so we can be quite sure that the feedback quoting the \"seizure\" answer is correct. We are aware that \"cooling of the core\" could also be aided by this procedures, but that is not specific enough to even be sure which part of the engine they are referring to, so we agree that it is not correct. Also, there are many different seals within an engine, they must be referring to blade tip seals in this answer, given the context. Those are the seals that exist between the end of the turbine blades and the casing that try to stop air escaping around the edge of the turbine. The most common type appears to be a slight cutout of the casing for the blade to fit in. Not all engines appear to have these, but some do.",

Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first.

EGT is obviously high when the engine is at high thrust but can also be increased due to long term engine health or due to short term issues. For instance, when flying on an older aircraft, you may notice if one of the engines has been more recently replaced as the EGT will likely be lower on that newer, healthier engine, as it has less ineficiencies and therefore produces the same thrust/N1 using less fuel and lower combustion temperatures, etc. EGT is also a measure of short term engine problems, and is particularly affected by poor airflow through the engine, as this primarily reduces the amount of cooling airflow available after combustion has occurred, so causes a rise in the EGT and TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature), which can sometimes limit an engine's thrust so these temperature limits are not exceeded. Let's go through the answers now: \"Because the air is colder, the temperature in the combustion chamber has to be increased to compensate.\" Incorrect. Cold air is brilliant for jet engines (once running) as the air is naturally denser and more thrust can be produced for the same temperatures, so it is nice and efficient, and reduces EGT for the same thrust output. \"Because of the low outside air temperature, fuel density is higher, so more fuel enters the combustion chamber, causing an increase in EGT.\" Incorrect. The fuel density is higher, but the fuel is introduced to the combustion chamber as necessary to produce the correct N1 or EPR (engine pressure ratio), not just blindly as a volume flow rate. The EGT is unaffected by this difference in density. \"Ice is forming on the leading edge of the wings, so more thrust is added to compensate, increasing EGT.\" Incorrect. Ice may be forming on the leading edges of the wings, and would require increased thrust, however, that would mean advancing the thrust levers, and the question says the thrust levers have not moved. \"Ice is forming around the engine intake, causing less air mass flow in the engine, increasing EGT.\" Correct. This is quite a likely cause, and if the engine inlet is not anti/de-iced, the formation of icing round the intake is likely to cause a reduced airflow into the engine, which will cause increased combustion temperatures and lower cooling (and therefore higher EGT) to produce the same N1/EPR.",

Some jet aircraft will not be able to start their main engines without an APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) or GPU (Ground Power Unit), and some will be able to start both engines off battery only (Boeing 787). What it is really asking is for knowledge of the way an engine is started. Turbine engines require a lot of energy to get the compressors spinning up to a sustainable speed, and some engines require air starting (B737 main engines, for instance), whereas some have electric starter motors that can be run off GPU or battery power, if the batteries are high enough voltage. The batteries have to be able to provide a very large amount of output over quite a short time in order to get the engine compressor(s) up to speed. The larger the engine, the more power that is required to start it. This is why batteries are only able to start smaller engines, as the batteries would need to be huge, and very high voltage, to start larger engines (as is the case in the B787, which is an exception). It is also the reason that APUs can be started by batteries alone, as they are very small turbine engines that are easy to start, but produce enough auxiliary power and bleed air to start the other engines and run various onboard systems. Some light jets do not have an APU, to save space and weight, so instead have quite powerful batteries to start their quite small main engines from battery power alone, when a GPU is not available. The RAT (ram air turbine) is a little wind turbine that drops out of the aircraft to provide hydraulic pressure (and sometimes electricity) if there are no other electrical or hydraulic sources available on the aircraft. This is to use essential items such as the flight controls in case of a multiple engine and electrical failure. It is not nearly powerful enough to start an engine.",

The purpose of the turbine is to extract energy from the flow to produce power. The turbine stage is usually of the same construction as the compressor, comprising of rotating discs with turbine blades and associated stator stages. The turbine generates power from the expanded flow by converting pressure energy to kinetic energy. Initially, prior to interacting with each turbine blade stage, velocity is increased by the converging ducts of the nozzle guide vanes (NGVs). There can be one or more turbine stages for each spool and, to extract as much as possible from the decreasing energy available from the gas stream, each subsequent stage has longer blades than the preceding stage. As the gas expands through the turbine and gives up its energy, pressure, velocity and temperature decrease.",

The main components of an exhaust section are: Jet pipe: forms the outer casing for the flow and guides it towards the exit area. The jet pipe continuously withstands flow temperatures in the range of 500-800°C. Exhaust cone: its purpose is to protect the turbine disc central area from the high temperature flow from the turbine area and control the velocity by the varying cross-section area. Additionally, it aims to prevent flow reversal or turbulence in the axis area by optimizing the flow of the expelled hot gases. Propelling nozzle: turbojets have a propelling nozzle downstream of the jet pipe in order to accelerate the flow. The flow acceleration results in an increased jet velocity that increases thrust for the air mass flow. Incorrect answer options: “Optimise the intake flow into the engine” – the exhaust cone is only influencing the exhaust gases; it has nothing to do with the air intake. “Reduce the flow of the expelled cold gases” – the purpose of the propelling nozzle is to accelerate the exhaust gases, not to slow them down. “Eliminate the flow of the expelled hot gases” – the cone itself doesn’t eliminate anything. It has only a particular (=converging) shape just to modify the flow of exhaust gases to provide a higher thrust.",

The FADEC has a dual channels Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for redundancy, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. In addition to the ECU, all the FADEC peripherals such as actuators, solenoids, electrical wiring, sensors, and fuel metering are also part of the FADEC system and are used for control and monitoring. The system has a three-phase permanent magnetic alternator for an internal power source. This independent alternator is also the electrical power source for all the FADEC sensors as well as the ECUs. By interfacing with other aircraft systems and its own engine sensors, the FADEC system provides the following functions: Automatic thrust rating control. Engine operation within safe limits. Fully automatic engine starting. Thrust Reverser Control. Engine overspeed and/or an EGT protection function. Engine monitoring and help for maintenance and troubleshooting. To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic. All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual, with the exception of some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating (that are single). To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link. Therefore, if one input parameter fails to be delivered, the input parameter from the other channel will be used to allow the correct computation of the engine parameters by the FADEC. This means that the FADEC is a single fault-tolerant, and it will ensure the efficient and correct running of the engine even in case of a detected malfunction.",

The question specifically mentions a turbojet engine, meaning that it has no bypass air, and therefore gains all its thrust from the high velocity airflow from the exhaust. After leaving the turbine, the gas is often initially decelerated through the early jet pipe section, due to the exhaust cone increasing the surface area of the jet pipe, thereby increasing the static pressure of the gas. This is to reduce losses due to friction (slower moving air = less friction with the walls). Depending on the engine, the walls of the jet pipe may also contract to keep the gas speed the same, it all depends on the usual gas speed leaving the turbine. The air is then accelerated through the convergent duct shape at the end of the exhaust to decrease the static pressure and increase the speed, making it more useful as jet thrust - the principle of equal and opposite reaction means that the force of the exhausted air drives the aeroplane forward. The output velocity will usually reach Mach 1 and stop there, as this is when the exhaust gas becomes \"choked\", and cannot get any faster without using afterburner.",

Through the Constant Speed Unit, the propeller controls the power output by varying the propeller blade pitch angle to maintain engine rpm. The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range, and the power lever positions corresponding to the ALPHA range are between flight idle and maximum power. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

This means that if the fan in the turbine of a jet engine is speeding up the air, then the static pressure would decrease. Dynamic pressure is the pressure exerted by the air because of its motion. If the turbine speeds up the air, then the dynamic pressure of the air would increase. The specific thrust is calculated by dividing the thrust created by the engine (net thrust) by the mass flow rate of the air (meaning how much air is flowing through the engine in a given amount of time). In this case, Net Thrust will remain constant. However, total Intake Airflow increases due to the the higher airflow/speed. Consequently, Specific Thrust decreases.",

            "explanation": "Gas turbine engines provide high overall thrust compared to other engines. However, they are much less responsive to thrust setting changes, due to the robustness of the design and the construction of the engine. The high inertia of the engine opposes quick acceleration or deceleration. To accelerate you have to overcome this inertia (resistance to spinning), plus the effort of compressing the air in the compressor - this in itself takes a tremendous amount of energy. Whilst this is happening, the airflow and the air/fuel ratio in the engine must carefully be controlled (the acceleration of the engine is difficult because the fuel has to be injected in increasing amounts for the same air mass flow, and only after this does the turbine extract more energy to accelerate the compressors). If more air was delivered from the compressor than the combustion chamber and the turbine could consume, the engine would suffer a compressor stall or surge. A surge can be catastrophic to the engine so designers have to balance out the need to accelerate without making the engine susceptible to surging. The spool-up time is how long it takes to increase RPM from idle to maximum value (approx. 7 seconds).",

It captures the required air mass flow and delivers it to the compressor at the correct design speed. That’s why the intake is slightly divergent in order to reduce the airflow’s velocity (=dynamic pressure) and increase the static pressure and temperature just before the fan and compressor’s first stages. Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers.",

The axial compressor is usually found on traditional jet engine that have axial flow. Each stage of the compressor usually increases the pressure by 1.2. However, as there are many stages, the pressure after an entire compressor section is usually much higher than the single stage. Due to their design which allows flow to continue flowing in the same direction, axial compressors allow for more mass flow than a centrifugal compressor. The centrifugal compressor is usually found on turboshaft engine, such as those powering turbo propellor aircraft or turbine helicopters. In the diagram you can see that instead of compressing the air coming into the compressor backwards, the centrifugal compressor works by pressing air outwards compared to the axis of the engine. The centrifugal compressor usually creates a pressure differential of 4 per stage. Unfortunately because of the change of direction of flow as you can see in the picture and the design of the compressor blades, the mass flow is reduced compared to a axial compressor. Note: Typical compression ratios for axial compressor are around 35:1, whereas for a centrifugal compressor it would be around 4.5:1.",

            ],
            "explanation": "A gas turbine engine free turbine does not drive a compressor, i.e. there’s no mechanical connection between the compressor and the power output shaft. The energy delivered by the free turbine stages is only dependent on the rotational speed of the HP spool. In this configuration, the engine will simply act as a gas generator to supply high-energy gases to an independent free power turbine driving a propeller or rotor via a reduction gearbox. This is why this type of turbine is often used on turboprop engines and helicopters. In fact, there will be two major assemblies: one shaft connecting the compressor and the compressor-driving turbine, and a free turbine placed after the compressor-driving turbine that is connected to a propeller. Because these two assemblies are not interconnected in any way, the propeller and free turbine assembly will be able to rotate at an independent speed from that of the compressor-turbine spool. The most suitable control system for a turboprop fitted with a free turbine is the direct control of fuel flow. In this system, the gas generator (the core of the engine) is controlled in the same manner as a turbojet, and the power available to the free turbine assembly is governed by the fuel flow. For instance: If the power setting is increased, the RPM of the compressor-turbine shaft will also increase. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by increasing the propeller’s blade angle. If the power setting is decreased, the RPM of the compressor-turbine shaft will also decrease. However, the free turbine and propeller assembly will be maintained at constant RPM by the Constant Speed Unit (CSU) that will do so by decreasing the propeller’s blade angle.",

The exhaust section begins downstream of the last turbine disc and ends where the flow re-joins the external environment. The main components of an exhaust section are: Jet pipe: forms the outer casing for the flow and guides it towards the exit area. The jet pipe continuously withstands flow temperatures in the range of 500-800°C. Exhaust cone: its purpose is to protect the turbine disc central area from the high temperature flow from the turbine area and control the velocity by the varying cross-section area. Propelling nozzle: turbojets have a propelling nozzle downstream of the jet pipe in order to accelerate the flow.

Much like a sparkplug in a car, igniter provide a source of heat to help ignite the fuel and air mixture inside the combustion chamber.

For the engine start, the igniter with the high energy level. Flight during heavy precipitation: During take-off on a contaminated runway or when flying through a thunderstorm, it is common to engage the continuous ignition to prevent engine flame out. This is lower energy level mode that does not cause as much wear on the ignition system as the high energy level normal for a start sequence. Seeing as there is no answer that includes both: “During engine start” and “During heavy precipitation or when taking off from a contaminated runway” The correct answer is incomplete but its statement 3 alone. During all other phases of flight, the aircraft combustion process does not require an igniter to prevent flame out as the heat produced by the combustion is enough to maintain the process continuous. Therefore “throughout the operating range of the engine” and “during engine acceleration” are incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The Flat Rating Concept The rating of a jet engine is the thrust performance that is guaranteed by the manufacturer for a new engine under specific operating conditions such as, take off, maximum continuous, climb, cruise. Some non Prat and Whitney (P&W) engines are rated to a constant compressor speed (RPM). P&W rates there engines to a constant exhaust gas temperature (EGT). This is referred to as the flat rating concept. To get your head around this concept you must understand the following principle. The temperature and density of the ambient air vary inversely. Lower temperature = > Higher Density Higher Temperature = >Lower Density The amount of airflow (lbs/sec) through the engine is a function of compressor speed and air density. It is greater when the compressor speed and density are high. The compressor speed is a function of the energy available to the compressors turbine. That energy comes from the combustion or air and fuel, so the turbine turns faster when the fuel flow rate is greater. The compressor speed is also a function of the airflow through the compressor. Higher rates of air flow reduce the speed of the compressor. The compressors rotational speed and the amount of airflow through the compressor are independent, they affect each other though. The turbine inlet temperature is proportional to the energy available to turn the turbine. The exhaust temperature is proportional to the turbine inlet temperature. So a higher EGT corresponds to a larger amount of energy to the turbine so it can turn the compressor faster. When EGT is held constant, or lowered the result is a prolonged hot section life and at the same time provides the thrust to meet the certification requirements.",

For example, the internal gearbox assembly of the CFM 56 contains a core engine thrust bearing and a core engine roller bearing. Like all the other engine’s moving parts, oil is used to lubricate and clean the accessory gearbox elements. The auxiliary gearbox is lubricated by oil by the engine oil system to reduce friction and wear between the moving parts, and to help maintain the proper functioning of the gearbox. The accessory units of a turbo-jet engine auxiliary gearbox are the following: AC generator through its constant speed drive (CSD) Oil pumps, Hydraulic pumps, High-pressure fuel pumps.",

Learning Objective 021.11.02.02.21: Describe the function of the diffuser. DIFFUSER The diffuser is the divergent section of the engine after the compressor and before the combustion chamber. The diffuser increases the cross-section of the duct, for a constant mass flow, the velocity drops. This increases the static pressure of the air. Additionally, it decelerates the approx. 350 m/s flow to an approx. 50 m/s flow before fuel injection in some engines. This deceleration is crucial for optimal fuel burning conditions. It prepares the air for entry into the flame burning area of the combustion section at a lower velocity (and with much higher pressure) so that the flame of combustion can burn continuously. If the air passed through the flame area at a high velocity, it could extinguish the flame. Therefore, it stops the flame being extinguished by the high dynamic pressure of the air, by turning a lot of that into static pressure.",

This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers. Even though the design of the engine intake is such that it normally prevents flow separation, in conditions of extreme crosswind this might still occur, and the compressor might stall.

            "explanation": "Turbojet and turbofan engines have exhausts that prove far more useful than just giving hot exhaust gasses somewhere to leave the engine. The exhaust gasses that leave the turbine are hot, high pressure, and still very fast. These are all forms of energy that we would like to \"get back\" from the air, and the exhaust is very finely tuned to allow us to do this. Initially, the air leaving the turbine is slowed down by a diverging area, usually provided by the presence of a \"tail cone\"/\"exhaust cone\". This has a few functions, including directing the gas to reduce disturbances, but mainly to reduce the speed of the gas, so it can travel through the exhaust without too much friction against the walls. A diverging area reduces speed, whilst increasing static pressure. The gas is now travelling at around Mach 0.5 in relation to the engine, but with high static pressure. Towards the back of the exhaust, we want to regain some of that speed from our excess static pressure. This is where we use a converging nozzle to regain that speed. The maximum speed the gas can reach here is Mach 1.0 without afterburners (we call this the nozzle being \"choked\"). Sometimes (for supersonic aircraft mostly), we then stick another diverging section on the end to take the extra gain from some pressure thrust and supersonic acceleration (this is now way above the syllabus). Note: This question does potentially have 2 correct answers. A divergent section is most correct due to its vague nature, and that is exactly what we want, but the way that is often achieved is through an \"exhaust cone\", which is placed right after the turbine. The feedback on the correct answer is solid as far as we can tell, but please inform us of any exam feedback you see about this question in the comments or by emailing us at info@atplquestions.com",

            "explanation": "Note: This is quite similar to question 211180, and has the same answer, but the wording of the question and the options are different, so we are treating the questions separately for now. Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually, this is followed by a compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. Therefore, if the opposite happens, i.e. the axial velocity through the compressor increases, the stall margin will be increased because there will be enough airflow (and more) to avoid a disruption. Caution must be taken in this situation as well because excessive forward (axial) airflow can produce overpressure at the compressor’s stages if its rotational speed is too low. This could eventually also induce a stall of the rear parts of the compressor should the excess pressure persist. That’s why the excessive pressure can be relieved by various means, such as bleed valves that will open at various stages to reduce overpressure and to maintain a more contant pressure ratio, etc. There is another way to think of this question, and that is like a fixed pitch propeller. If the aircraft is travelling slowly (low IAS) but with high RPM, then the angle of attack of the blade is very high and the propeller is likely to stall. If, like in this question, the aircraft is travelling fast (high IAS), then the blade angle of attack will be lower, and therefore further from the stall (i.e. an increased stall margin).",

In this way, the flame is passed through the tubes to every single can, ensuring a uniform ignition. Tubo-annular combustion chamber: consists of several tubes radially disposed around the engine between the compressor and turbine section, all sitting in the same annular casing. The advantage of this evolved arrangement is that the airflow is carefully controlled and is more evenly spread over the first stage turbine. Annular combustion chamber: uses the entire annulus casing between the compressor and the turbine for combustion. This helps to provide a better thermal distribution on the HP turbine and reduce turbine wearing. For the same power output, the annular chamber length is 75% of a tubo-annular chamber of similar diameter. Consequently, the wall area is much smaller and the amount of cooling air required to protect the flame tube wall is also reduced by approximately 15%. Combustion efficiency is increased and air pollution reduced making it the most widespread combustion chamber type on nowadays commercial jets.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is a complicated question and we think it is right on the edge of the learning objectives, but the feedback indicates it exists in this form, and that this is the correct answer. Please let us know if you see this in the real exam and anything you remember about it, thank you. In a turboshaft engine, the same principles of a turbine engine apply, and the air is compressed to be burnt in the combustion chamber, with that hot expanded air then used to drive the turbines. Some of the turbines drive the compressors to restart the cycle, and in most turboshaft engines, the remaining airflow drives the \"free power\" turbines, which drive the propeller. Once the turbine stages have been passed, the air is still at quite high pressure and high temperature. The exhaust is designed to trade this extra energy for airflow velocity and therefore be able to gain a little extra thrust as the exhaust is pointing backwards, so the back-flowing exhaust air can provide extra thrust to the aircraft. To do this, the overall effect of the exhaust is to redirect the airflow (and smoothen it for reduced noise and inefficiencies), and it is therefore overall convergent (though this is not always shown by the figures due to simplification), to use the venturi effect to increase airflow speed whilst reducing static pressure significantly. This decrease in static pressure is intended to get it close to ambient pressure to transfer all that energy into speed. Static temperature drops due to the decreased static pressure. Volume change is quite complicated in this scenario, and not really mentioned in any reference material for turbine engines, but as the temperature has decreased, the density should have increased, and therefore the volume of air should decrease, but this does not take into account compressibility, etc., which is a factor at the high speeds involved. This increase in density should also be present in the transonic regime as velocity increases, but the calculations start to get very messy at that point.",

            "explanation": "\"I. A compressor stall is most likely to occur in a compressor designed for a high pressure ratio operating at high RPM.\" INCORRECT A compressor stall occurs when there is an imbalance between the air flow supply and the airflow demand - in other words, a pressure ratio that is incompatible with the engine RPM. As a result, smooth airflow is interrupted and pressure fluctuations are created within the turbine. It occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack (just like a wing). Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing a stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. \"II. A compressor stall is most likely to occur when the air flow stagnates in the rear stages of the compressor.\" CORRECT As mentioned above, air stagnates in the REAR stages, which results in a lack of air in the FRONT stages with subsequent low axial velocity in front stages. This will lead to a high angle of attack of the rotor blades determining a STALL. To avoid such situation, turbine engines are fitted with VIGV (variable inlet guide vanes) and VSV (variable stator vanes) that ensure correct airflow through the stages of the engine.",

On nowadays commercial aircraft, the FADEC controls the start valve electrically and operates it pneumatically with bleed air. Ignition ON: the igniters are selected ON and are ready to light the mixture. High-pressure fuel ON: after fuel is delivered by the high-pressure shut-off valve (HPSOV) it is sprayed into the combustion chamber by fuel nozzles under high-pressure where it is mixed with compressed air and lights up. Light-up: the mixture starts burning and the flame spreads all along with the combustion chamber (since it is interconnected). The flame becomes self-sustainable. Self-sustaining speed: all the engine’s spools have reached a self-sustaining speed where assistance from the air starter is not needed anymore. The air starter is disengaged by the coupling between engine N2 spool and starter by the use of centrifugal forces. Starter circuit canceled. Incorrect answers: “A combustion chamber, a starter, and bleed air to ignite the air/fuel mixture” – bleed air is not igniting anything. The igniters light up the mixture, not the bleed air. Bleed air from the APU, another engine, or a ground pneumatic unit is only directed to the air starter that will rotate the HP compressor (N2). “A turbine to compress and ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber” – the turbine is not compressing the air; it is only driving the compressor that will compress the incoming air mass flow. “High-pressure fuel pumps and a compressor to raise the pressure of the air/fuel mixture for starting” – HP fuel pumps are definitely needed, however, what is wrong with this answer option is that it states that the compressor raises the pressure of the air/fuel mixture. This is incorrect as the compressor only raises the pressure of the air.",

The main auxiliary gearbox of most gas turbine engine is driven by the HP compressor shaft via an internal gearbox to an external gearbox. It provides the drive for a wide variety of services. It can even serve as mounting support for the engine. For example, the internal gearbox assembly of the CFM 56 contains a core engine thrust bearing, and a core engine roller bearing. Like all the other engine’s moving parts, oil is used to lubricate and clean the accessory gearbox elements. The accessory units of a turbo-jet engine auxiliary gearbox are the following: AC generator through its constant speed drive (CSD), Oil pumps, Hydraulic pumps, High-pressure fuel pumps. Some engines also have a second gearbox, in order to share the load of the accessory units, and this is operating at a much lower speed, connected to the LP compressor shaft, in the same way as the main gearbox.",

Along the turbine, the axial velocity fluctuates up and down as it passes through each guide vane and turbine blade. As the turbine extracts energy from the air, the temperature decreases axially the further it gets from the combustion chamber. In stator of turbine pressure drops and velocity of airflow increases while in rotor velocity and pressure both decrease.

When oil is cold, it has a high viscosity and flows slowly, thus making the fluid stream quite difficult. Therefore, when the engine is started on a very cold early morning after spending the night on the parking stand, the oil pressure will be higher than normal during start-up. This is normal, and as the oil temperature increases, the viscosity will decrease and the oil pressure will subsequently drop back to more normal levels. This is better for engine lubrication and for lower engine resistance, and the aircraft should not commence engine run-ups or take-off before the oil temperature has risen sufficiently, at which point the pressure will be back to normal. That’s why engine manufacturers impose a warm-up time before take-off. This will also allow the oil temperature to stabilise and increase within the acceptable range, as it will initially be pretty low. As an example, the warm-up time for an IAE V2500 engine, which often powers A320 family aircraft, is 5 minutes (This specifically is a gas turbine engine, but it is exactly the same principle in a piston engine).",

Initial feedback gave the correct answer of D (\"is not; the compressor\"), but more recent feedback has given answer B as correct (\"is not; the turbine\"). 021.11.01.02.09: Explain the principle of a free turbine or free-power turbine. Free power turbines are turbine engines that can be used for turboprop powered aircraft or turboshaft powered helicopters, and have a variety of benefits over direct drive alternatives. The main feature of them is that the power output shaft (to the rotors or propeller) is not physically connected to any part of the \"gas generator\", which is the set of compressors fed by the normal turbines. Instead of linking the propeller to one of the standard turbine spools, an extra turbine is added to the engine after the standard turbines, which absorbs most of the remaining energy to use solely for the turning of the propeller, before the air gets sent out of the exhaust. This means that the propeller can be governed to go at any speed the pilots requires, which will mean that the free power turbine will also have to go at the corresponding speed (they are connected via a reduction gearbox to go from the turbine's 50 000-ish RPM to the propeller's 2000-ish RPM), but without making the rest of the engine components go at that speed, allowing the standard turbine-compressor spools (known as the \"gas generator\") to stay at their optimum speed, where they can be most efficient, and longer lasting. Depending on how you look at this, it also means that the free power turbine can go at the optimum speed for each scenario, rather than having to go at the speed of the gas generator. This does mean that there are two correct answers here, and therefore we await further feedback, and the result of any appeals. The engine (gas generator) then becomes far simpler to operate as well, as it is almost self regulating in its speeds, etc. with no outside influence. All we do is harness the left-over pressure and velocity of the air - of which there should be plenty - to put through our propellers. There must be a constant speed unit to regulate propeller RPM, and particular care must be paid to over-torquing the engine. Another useful feature of a free power turbine is the ease of starting, as propeller drag does not affect the independent gas generator. Propeller feathering is also possible with this format.",

Given the wording of the question, we can assume that the engine is either being started (most likely) or already running, and in both cases, the correct answer is still the same. EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) is pretty self-explanatory, and if it exceeds its limit, then this is likely due to too much combustion, not enough cooling airflow, or not enough airflow through the engine at all. The EGT is particularly important as it is a strong indicator of engine health, and though it is not great for troubleshooting as so many different things cause an EGT rise, it is excellent for knowing if the engine has an issue at all. The EGT is measured just after the turbine section, so the limit is usually there to avoid extreme heat and stress damaging the turbine blades, which is the highest stress component in the whole engine, due to the high RPM and high temperature. These two effects mean that turbine blades have to be actively cooled and made smaller than their mounting so they have room to expand, as they stretch slightly under load. Whether during start-up or not, damaging the turbine blades is the real issue here. As for the other options: An N2 overspeed is unlikely as this requires significant damage or a sustained overpressure in the turbine that is not replicated in the compressor, which is very unlikely. A stall is related to the compressor blades, and this is occurring downstream of the compressor. The fuel will not drain as it has already been burnt, otherwise how would the EGT have risen so high?",

Figure 3 has the rotor AFTER the stator which is incorrect. Figure 4 does not make sense as the airflow will not be redirected by the stator at all, in fact the stator would likely choke the down-going airflow and greatly reduce the effectiveness of the compressor We are left with Figure 1, which is correct.

A compressor stall is most likely to occur in a compressor designed for a high-pressure ratio operating at high RPM.\" INCORRECT A compressor stall occurs when there is an imbalance between the airflow supply and the airflow demand - in other words, a pressure ratio that is incompatible with the engine RPM. As a result, smooth airflow is interrupted and pressure fluctuations are created within the turbine. It occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack (just like a wing). Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually, this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. \"II. A compressor stall is most likely to occur when the airflow stagnates in the front stages of the compressor.\" INCORRECT As mentioned above, air stagnates in the REAR stages, which results in a lack of air in the FRONT stages with subsequent low axial velocity in the front stages. This will lead to a high angle of attack of the rotor blades determining a STALL. To avoid such a situation, turbine engines are fitted with VIGV (variable inlet guide vanes) and VSV (variable stator vanes) that ensure correct airflow through the stages of the engine.",

Therefore, there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually, this is followed by a compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. Therefore, if the opposite happens, i.e. the axial velocity through the compressor increases, the stall margin will be increased because there will be enough airflow (and more) to avoid a disruption. Caution must be taken in this situation as well because excessive forward (axial) airflow can produce overpressure at the compressor’s stages if its rotational speed is too low. This could eventually also induce a stall of the rear parts of the compressor should the excess pressure persist. That’s why the excessive pressure can be relieved by various means, such as bleed valves that will open at various stages to reduce overpressure and to maintain a more constant pressure ratio, etc. There is another way to think of this question, and that is like a fixed pitch propeller. If the aircraft is travelling slowly (low IAS) but with high RPM, then the angle of attack of the blade is very high and the propeller is likely to stall. If, like in this question, the aircraft is travelling fast (high IAS), then the blade angle of attack will be lower, and therefore further from the stall (i.e. an increased stall margin).",

The auxiliary power unit (APU) is a small gas turbine engine which is installed in the tail section of the aircraft. Most APUs will be electrically started, using the aircraft battery. It is an engine optimised for shaft power output to drive its own 115 V, 400 Hz AC generator. Once it is running it provides AC power for aircraft systems, as well as pneumatic bleed for air-conditioning and hydraulic power for systems when the engines are shut down. The APU reduces the need for using ground equipment to supply the aircraft, which consequently improves operational efficiency and reduces costs. Some aircraft (the Boeing 777 for one) have the capability to start the APU using pneumatic air also, but this is not very common, and so is not the correct answer.",

This compressed air driven from the compressor is known as bleed air. When selecting the bleed air ‘ON’ some of the air will be sucked out of the normal flow inside the engine and will induce some inconveniences and risks. In fact, the mass flow of air will be reduced, which will need to be compensated by an increase in fuel flow and gas generator speed (N1), which will increase the engine’s overall temperature, especially the turbine temperature since less air is available for cooling. You can observe the increase in N1 during descent when selecting the engine anti-ice ON – the idle RPM will be increased. It also increases specific fuel consumption and the EGT and the power output (or thrust) will be decreased, in other words, aircraft, and more precisely engine performance will greatly be decreased.",

The battery provides the initial electrical power needed to start these smaller engines. This process is particularly common during pre-flight procedures or when the main engines are not running. Should APU and/or engine-driven generators fail, some aircraft provide an emergency means of generating electrical, and sometimes also hydraulic power. A RAT (Ram Air Turbine) can be ejected from the aircraft and positioned in the air flow around the fuselage. The turbine then drives a shaft, which is connected to a magnet-inducing current in the coils of an emergency generators. These generators are not usually very powerful, and their power can therefore only be directed to the most important aircraft systems. The RAT is typically not the primary means of starting engines during normal operations; it serves as a backup or emergency power source.",

Nowadays, this is calculated and modulated by the Full Authority Digital Engine Control system. Incorrect answers: “Interstage bleed valves must be fitted to the compressor section” – this option refers to the bleed valves that are fitted at the compressor’s front stages to avoid overpressure and a compressor stall. Their purpose is simply to dump pressure by blowing air out of the axial flow of air and therefore, increasing the mass flow through the compressor to ensure every stage receives a proper amount of air. The interstage bleed valves will not regulate in any way the fuel/air mixture delivered to the combustion chamber. “It must be capable of utilizing different fuel types” – this is an odd option since gas turbine engines aren’t usually certified to use a different type of fuels. Besides, this quality wouldn’t guarantee the efficient combustion of the mixture. “Air must be supplied to the combustor section at a constant flow” – the combustion chamber is not always supplied at a constant flow. The mass flow of air is always varied depending on the power setting variations.",

            "explanation": "FADEC stands for Full Authority Digital Engine Control and is basically a digital control system mounted on the engine’s fan case, that performs the entire engine management tasks. The FADEC has a dual channels Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for redundancy, with one channel always active and a second one on standby. If one channel fails, the other automatically takes control and performs the exact same functions. In addition to the ECU, all the FADEC peripherals such as actuators, solenoids, electrical wiring, sensors, and fuel metering are also part of the FADEC system and are used for control and monitoring. The system has a three-phase permanent magnetic alternator for an internal power source. This independent alternator is also the electrical power source for all the FADEC sensors as well as the ECUs. By interfacing with other aircraft systems and its own engine sensors, the FADEC system provides the following functions: Automatic thrust rating control. Engine operation within safe limits. Fully automatic engine starting. Thrust Reverser Control. Engine overspeed and/or an EGT protection function. Engine monitoring and help for maintenance and troubleshooting. To make the FADEC’s operation more reliable, the system uses the dual inputs logic. All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual, with the exception of some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating (that are single). To increase the fault-tolerant design where the engine will still be able to operate within a required reliability and safety range, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via a cross-channel data link. Therefore, if one input parameter fails to be delivered, the input parameter from the other channel will be used to allow the correct computation of the engine parameters by the FADEC. This means that the FADEC is a single fault-tolerant, and it will ensure the efficient and correct running of the engine even in case of a detected malfunction.",

            "explanation": "The turbine section of a gas turbine engine is the area where materials are under the most stress. Due to the centripetal force, a small turbine blade weighing 50 grams when stationary can exert a load of two tons whilst the turbine is spinning at full speed. On top of the centripetal force which the compressor section also experiences, the turbine section also deals with the heat from the combustion chamber, which can reach temperatures of 1700°C. The combination of the centripetal force and the heat causes creep, which is the slow stretching of the metal. This is the reason why the blades in the turbine have to be replaced to prevent failure during normal operations. Therefore the hotter the gases from the combustion chamber, the more the turbines blades will creep. That’s why the turbine is usually temperature limited to prevent excess creep. Fun fact: In the past, the material used for jet engine turbine blades used to be steel. Steel required a much lower temperature limitation to prevent creep hence why older engines are much more sensitive to temperature. Modern turbine blades use nickel and super based alloys, and even further developments have been made into ceramic materials that allow temperatures to reach the region of 1700°C. Incorrect answers: “Compressor section”: In the high pressure section of the compressor, temperatures can be high enough that nickel based alloys are required, however they will never reach the same temperatures as the turbine. The compressor section is located at the front of the engine and therefore is not effected by the extra heat from the combustion section. “Jet pipe”: Without the use of afterburners, air entering the exhaust system is usually within 500°C and 900°C, hence lower than the turbine section. On top of the lower temperatures, the exhaust is a none movable part so no extra stress is caused by centripetal force. “Casing of the combustion chamber”: materials in and around the combustion chamber allow for temperatures of up to and over 2000°C. Materials can handle the heat because the combustion chamber components are static and therefore do not experience any centripetal force.",

An APU has its own electric starter motor powered either by the airplane’s main batteries or by the Ground Power Unit (if connected). The APU uses fuel from the main fuel tanks (the left main tank on the A320) and burns about 130 kg/h on the ground (A320 APU). In order to use the APU in flight, it needs to be certified and guarantee that the starting sequence can be carried out at high altitudes and operate under load at even higher altitudes. A dedicated flight deck APU control panel consists of a master switch button and a start button. The master switch will simply energize the APU system and its internal computer. It will also open the air intake flap and open the fuel isolation valve. The start switch is putting the ignition ON and starts the automatic start sequence. Either some lights, or a separate fault panel, or an electronic APU monitoring page will display and announce any APU faults. The APU will automatically shut down in one of the following cases: Overspeed, No acceleration, Low oil pressure, EGT overtemperature, High oil temperature, Underspeed, Reverse flow, etc.",

It controls the engine to run efficiently with full control of the system. It also reduces pilot workload by making the engine control and monitoring much easier. Since the authority of FADEC is very extensive, losing the correct operation may cause loss of engine control, therefore to ensure sufficient redundancy, each engine is normally equipped with two FADEC computers, and two of any essential components or sensors, with one channel always active and a second one on standby.

When the combustion gases pass through the turbine, the pressure drops. The higher the temperature resulting from combustion, the greater the gas expansion and energy transfer to the turbine. However, because the materials used in the turbine assembly are temperature limited, temperature limitations are usually imposed on the turbine section to avoid complete damage to the turbine. An additional mitigation to the blades’ expansion due to the high turbine temperatures is the active control clearance. It will provide greater clearances between the blade tips and the casing. This is achieved by managing the clearance between the gas turbine casing and the tips of the rotating blades, referred to as turbine tip clearance. It monitors and varies the diameter of the turbine engine's casing to minimize the clearance between the rotor and the casing, researchers have found that an increase in tip clearance directly results in a decrease in turbine efficiency.",

The system is designed to prevent the turbine from rubbing against the casing, which can cause damage to the engine and adversely affect its performance. Active clearance control achieves this by controlling the cooling air flow and maintaining the minimum separation between the turbine and casing, even during changes in engine temperature, speed, and load. To optimise engine efficiency, active clearance control utilises a turbine engine's FADEC to monitor and adjust the diameter of the shroud casing. This process is automatic, and involves tapping off bleed air from the engine's compressor stage and directing it to the shroud casing. This air can be heated or cooled to cause expansion or contraction of the casing, which in turn helps to maintain the minimum clearance between the turbine and outer casing.",

Caution, the total pressure (and temperature) will remain constant - it is only a trade of dynamic pressure for static pressure. Compression (=increase in static pressure) is a process where heat is released, which explains why the temperature behaves in the same way through a divergent duct as pressure. This geometry is also called the ‘pitot intake’, and it has thick, smoothly rounded lips to prevent flow separation under any flight conditions/maneuvers. In simple words, when moving through a Divergent Duct the velocity of the air decreases but pressure and temperature increase.",

The decrease in altitude causes an increase in pressure, thus an increase in density and a corresponding increase in thrust – since more air is entering the gas turbine engine. “2. The specific fuel consumption increases slightly as the pressure altitude decreases at constant TAS.” CORRECT. Specific fuel consumption varies proportionally to the temperature => If the temperature is increasing, specific fuel consumption increases. Assuming standard conditions => temperature increasing with decreasing pressure altitude => specific fuel consumption increases with decreasing pressure altitude (inversely proportional).",

            "explanation": "Stalls in axial gas turbines engines occurs when the angle of attack of the blades exceeds the critical angle of attack, just like a wing. This happens when the axial velocity of the air in the engine is significantly lower that the rpm of the compressor stage. This can occur in multiple situations: Disrupted airflow at the engine intake Damaged compressor blades Damaged turbine blades Engine acceleration/deceleration too rapid Stalls at low speed usually occur because the acceleration of the engine is exceeding the acceleration at which air can move towards the intake of the engine, causing a stagnation of air at the rear of the compressor stages. In other words, the RPM of the compressor stage will exceed the axial air velocity. Therefore there is a lack of air ahead of the front stage of the compressor, making it stall first. Usually this is followed by a complete compressor stall, and possibly a surge depending on the severity of the stall. To avoid compressor stalls, Variable Inlet Guide Vanes (VIGV) and Variable Stator Vanes are installed to change the relative flow of the air between the compressor sections, therefore reducing the effective angle of attack of the blades. Also some engine have a bleed in the rear of the compressor section to prevent excessive pressure causing potential back pressure. The other answers are incorrect: “Not tendency to stall”: Compressor blades are built so that they achieve their optimum angle of attack at the aircrafts normal operating speeds, so cruise speeds, for maximum fuel efficiency. Therefore at low aircraft speeds and during engine start when there is little or no axial airflow velocity, the compressor has a high tendency to stall or surge if care isn’t take. Modern FADEC systems combined with the VIGV’s and the VSV’s prevent this from happening therefore it usually isn’t a problem anymore unless a compressor/turbine section is damaged. “A tendency to stall in the center stages”: Axial compressor usually stall first in the front stage of the compressor. “A tendency to stall in the rear stages”: Axial compressor usually stall first in the front stage of the compressor.",

The limitation is posed on the engine computer by inputting a flexible thrust temperature for the engine, which essentially tells the engine computer an artificial outside air temperature that is higher than the actual temperature. This way the engine computer believes that the entering air is hotter than it really is. At outside air temperatures above the flat rated temperature, there is a specific thrust value (variable by pressure altitude) for each temperature. If the thrust requirement for the take-off is known, the associated temperature at which this thrust would be produced can be extracted from the applicable charts.

            "explanation": "The compressor’s main task is to increase the mass flow through the engine by pressurizing the air. Its efficiency depends mostly on the aerofoil sections, pitch angles, and the length/chord ratios of the blades. The thermal efficiency and the work output of the continuous pressure cycle are both proportional to the compressor pressure ratio. The compressor is an annular duct through which the air passes and across which are arranged a series of small blades of aerofoil section that will compress the incoming air. Because of the small pressure increase at each compressor stage, numerous stages are required to achieve the desired delivery pressure at the combustion chamber. Another reason is that the power output of a turbine stage is higher than the power consumption of a compressor stage, therefore by fitting several compressor stages the power generated by the turbine can be efficiently used. From this point of view, the centrifugal compressor has a maximum pressure ratio of about 4.5:1 for a single stage, and up to 6:1 for a two-stage, single-entry centrifugal compressor. The upper limit for axial compressors is more a matter of stability and complexity, with current values of approximately 10:1 for single-spool compressors, and in excess of 30:1 for multi-spool compressors. Although higher pressure ratios give higher engine efficiency due to improved specific fuel consumption, a balance must be found between efficiency and the power needed from the turbine to drive the compressor. Sufficient power must remain to move the aircraft, and the turbine has a restricted limit to the power which it can generate.",

The LP compressor consists of a fan and several compressor stages, and it is linked to the LP turbine by the LP shaft. The fan drive gear system is a simple planetary gear reduction unit that connects the fan rotor to the LP compressor which will make them both rotate at the same speed.

Through the Constant Speed Unit, the propeller controls the power output by varying the propeller blade pitch angle to maintain engine rpm. The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range, and the power lever positions corresponding to the ALPHA range are between flight idle and maximum power. However, while maneuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is pretty low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) is controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will select a blade pitch angle by moving the power lever fully aft and lifting it up. The first detent of the BETA range will correspond to the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled full aft of the BETA range, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that the maximum reverse power is produced (=negative thrust). This will usually be the case at landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration.",

It can also deliver air for cabin air conditioning and for main engine starting. An APU has its own electric starter motor powered either by the airplane’s main batteries or by the Ground Power Unit (if connected). The APU uses fuel from the main fuel tanks (the left main tank on the A320) and burns about 130 kg/h on the ground (A320 APU). In order to use the APU in flight, it needs to be certified and guarantee that the starting sequence can be carried out at high altitudes and operate under load at even higher altitudes. In certain situations, the APU cabin air supply, and electrical supply could be crucial, so it is important that a large enough operational flight envelope is certified. A dedicated flight deck APU control panel consists of a master switch button and a start button. The master switch will simply energize the APU system and its internal computer. It will also open the air intake flap and open the fuel isolation valve. The start switch is putting the ignition ON and starts the automatic start sequence. Either some lights, or a separate fault panel, or an electronic APU monitoring page will display and announce any APU faults. The APU will automatically shut down in one of the following cases: Overspeed, No acceleration, Low oil pressure, EGT overtemperature, High oil temperature, Underspeed, Reverse flow, etc.",

The air leaving the compressor in a turbine engine is usually very fast, somewhere around the speed of the aircraft, meaning that 500 feet per second is an acceptable number to use. This is not a viable speed for the airflow in the combustion chamber, as the flame front of Jet A1 travels at around the region of 2 feet per second, so the flame would be extinguished immediately in a 500 ft/s airflow. Therefore, we have to use devices to slow this airflow down. The main device used is a diffuser, after the final compressor stage (and stator vane to straighten the airflow), the diffuser increases the cross-section of the duct, and given the constant mass flow, the velocity drops significantly. This also increases the static pressure of the air, gaining some of the energy back from the lost velocity, and which is excellent for intense combustion. furthermore, there are other speed reductions built into the initial combustion chamber that are used for slowing down the primary air (the initial air which is mixed with fuel and burnt) around the area of the \"snout\", where the air is split into primary and secondary air, and these all help to reduce the speed of the airflow to a more manageable speed which will allow the flame front to burn continuously.",

Learning Objective 021.11.04.01.05: Describe the terms ‘alpha range’, ‘beta range’ and ‘reverse thrust’ as applied to a turboprop power lever. Modern turboprop engines deliver very high power in flight. Through the Constant Speed Unit, the propeller controls the power output by varying the propeller blade pitch angle to maintain engine rpm. The blade pitch angle range required in flight is known as the ALPHA control range, and the power lever positions corresponding to the ALPHA range are between flight idle and maximum power. However, while manoeuvering on the ground, the power required for a turboprop engine is very low. Therefore, the controls have been adapted such that when on the ground, the blade pitch angle (therefore the thrust produced) can be controlled directly by the pilot, overriding the CSU. This ground range is known as the BETA control range. The flight crew will use the beta range by moving the power lever fully aft within the normal (alpha) range to the flight idle position and lifting it up. The power lever will then be able to move backwards further, and is now in the beta range (just below flight idle). The first detent within the BETA range is the ground idle detent that will allow the pilots to produce minimum level of thrust, just enough power to taxi the aircraft. If the lever is pulled further aft of the ground idle detent, the pilot will lower the blade pitch angle such that reverse thrust is produced, and the stop at the end of the beta range is where the maximum reverse power is produced (= maximum negative thrust). This will usually only be used during landing in order to assist the aircraft’s deceleration. Therefore, the beta range exists between flight idle (\"just below flight idle\" is actually more correct, as flight idle is included in the alpha range, not the beta range) and maximum reverse power.",

            "explanation": "This is an odd question, and somewhat deviates from the learning objectives. Nonetheless, in its current for directly from exam feedback, it is answerable and has a \"most correct\" answer in our opinion. Of course, the main function of the compressor in a turbine engine is for compressing air to feed more of it into the combustion chamber and therefore burning more fuel/air mixture. Other functions, in our opinion, include providing bleed air ducts to remove air for pneumatic systems on the aircraft, and as in this question, increasing the cooling of the turbine through secondary and tertiary airflow. One of the big issues with high power turbofan engines in particular is that their combustion chambers burn ridiculously hot, and no materials can really withstand these temperatures, so whilst some of the high pressure air is used of combustion in the chamber, more of the air becomes secondary air that flows around the combustion area and is introduced later to cool the hot gasses just after being burnt. On some engines, unburnt compressor air is also fed in just before the turbine (tertiary air) to avoid overheating the turbine blades as the TGT (turbine gas temperature) is often the most limiting temperature in gas turbine engines. Notice on the figure above that some air avoids the combustion chamber, this is cooling air. Going through the options: \"Driving the associated spool turbine.\" - Incorrect as the turbine drives the associated compressor, e.g. the LP turbine powers the LP compressor. \"Expelling the hot gasses from the combustion process.\" - Less correct, as this is not really the job that it is doing. The hot gasses have to go somewhere after expanding, but that has to be in the direction of the turbine, where there is no back pressure, and the compressor provides enough \"back pressure\" to avoid the air being shot out forwards. The secondary air is for cooling, not directing airflow. \"Cooling the intake air to allow for better combustion.\" - Incorrect, the compressor heats up the air naturally through compression. \"Increase the engine airflow for better turbine cooling.\" - Correct. The secondary and tertiary air are used in this way.",

The working principle of the gas turbine engine is comparable to that of a piston engine as both engines use a cycle made of induction, compression, combustion, and exhaust phases. The only difference is the way these phases will be achieved as the gas turbine engine is capable of dealing with much larger amounts of energy for a given size and weight. The other great advantage of the gas turbine engine is that the whole working cycle is continuous and entirely rotational providing an overall smoother operation, whereas the piston engine uses an intermittent reciprocating motion which is converted to rotary motion by means of cranks. Summary: Piston engine -Process is intermittent -Combustion is at constant volume Jet engine -Process is continuous -Combustion is at constant pressure.",

They are composed of small grooves that are tightly fitted inside the axle and have long guides for oil, making it impossible for the oil to escape. However, considering that these seals are used between rotating and stationary parts, there needs to be some flexibility so that they can allow free movement of the various elements.",

The rectifier will avoid any discharge back into the coil winding while the capacitor will charge up to a value that will break down the sealed discharge gap.
