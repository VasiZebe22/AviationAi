Looking at the regulation below, we can see that there are some non-specific rules about making sure the aircraft and occupants are safe, given the carriage of PRMs, which would naturally include a limit of how many PRMs can be on board, but this is an operator chosen limit, as long as it is approved by the authority. Therefore, there is no hard and fast limit, but it relatively easy to say that 70% of a 10 passenger helicopter being PRMs would make any evacuation much more difficult, and therefore less safe, with only 3 able-bodied passengers able to assist more than double that amount of PRMs. The highest proportion of PRMs to able-bodied passengers in airline policies we were able to find was 1:1. The other options present are not correct: The \"80%\" rule does not exist. All passengers should always be briefed on how to operate seat belts and the location of life jackets. The overwater element does add some danger, but the same flight over land would be dangerous to perform with so many PRMs also. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP.

An easy memory aid for climbing or descending is S. A. N. D. which is South - Ascend and North - Descend. Looking at the answers: 'Descend as quickly as possible without any lateral deviation' --> INCORRECT. Descending rapidly without any lateral deviation will endanger the aircraft as the NAT tracks are stacked vertically with aircraft. 'Immediately descend to 500 ft away from the level' --> INCORRECT. 500 ft is for contingency scenarios, not for weather avoidance. 'Descend slowly without any lateral deviation' --> INCORRECT. Any descent while still on the NAT track will endanger the aircraft as the NAT tracks are stacked vertically with aircraft. 'Deviate 30º left or right and descend 300 ft away from the assigned level' --> CORRECT. Not a perfect answer, but the only possible correct one here. You must turn off track initially and once 5 NM off track can descend 300 ft if the turn was to the north. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL NAT DOC 007 13.4 DEVIATIONS AROUND SEVERE WEATHER 13.4.6 If the aircraft is required to deviate from track or route to avoid adverse meteorological conditions and prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. Until an ATC clearance is received, the pilot shall take the following actions: a) if possible, deviate away from an organized track or route system b) establish communications with and alert nearby aircraft by broadcasting, at suitable intervals: aircraft identification, flight level, position (including ATS route designator or the track code) and intentions, on the frequency in use and on 121.5 MHz (or, as a backup, on the inter-pilot air-to-air frequency 123.450 MHz); c) watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS (if equipped); d) turn on all aircraft exterior lights (commensurate with appropriate operating limitations); e) for deviations of less than 9.3 km (5 NM) from the originally cleared track or route remain at a level assigned by ATC; f) for deviations greater than 9.3 km (5 NM) from the originally cleared track or route, when the aircraft is approximately 9.3 km (5 NM) from track or route, initiate a level change in accordance with Table below. If flying generally Eastbound (i.e. a magnetic track of 000° to 179°) and deviating left (ie north) of track then descend 300 ft; if, however, deviating right (i.e. south) of track then climb 300 ft. If flying generally Westbound (i.e. a magnetic track of 180° to 359°) and deviating left (i.e. south) of track then climb 300 ft; if, however, deviating right (i.e. north) of track then descend 300 ft.

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO Doc 007 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADS‐C and ADS‐B transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly self‐ selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when non‐normal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude‐keeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as “Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)”. 8.5.9 This procedure provides for offsets within the following guidelines: a) an aircraft may fly offsets right of centreline up to a maximum of 2 NM; and b) offsets left of centreline are not permitted.",

Accountable Manager: Holds ultimate responsibility and authority for the safety and compliance of the operator. Safety Manager: Manages the day to day operation and effectiveness of the operator's Safety Management System (SMS). Here we are asked who would be responsible for the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programme. This is describing the safety manager. The safety manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SMS safety management system, which includes FDM. For a smaller operator (Non complex) this is typically the accountable manager or a line Captain. Both of these positions offer sufficient relevant experience in operational roles to be an effective safety manager. For a larger operator (Complex) this position would now need a more dedicated specialist due to the size or type of operation. Now the operator will need a safety manager and safety review board AMC1 ORO.

This training should be provided at the time of operator conversion training and thereafter at intervals not exceeding three years. The content and duration of the training should be adapted to the security threats of the individual operator and should ensure that crew members act in the most appropriate manner to minimise the consequences of acts of unlawful interference. This programme should include the following elements: (a) determination of the seriousness of the occurrence; (b) crew communication and coordination; (c) appropriate self-defence responses; (d) use of non-lethal protective devices assigned to crew members whose use is authorised by the Member State; (e) understanding of behaviour of terrorists so as to facilitate the ability of crew members to cope with hijacker behaviour and passenger responses; (f) in case where cabin crew are required, live situational training exercises regarding various threat conditions; (g) flight crew compartment procedures to protect the aircraft; (h) aircraft search procedures, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 300/2008, including identification of prohibited articles; and (i) guidance on the least risk bomb locations.",

            "explanation": "Looking at the answer options: 'Improve the ability of the flight crew to perform dead reckoning navigation in the event of a loss of on-board navigation systems, in order to continue flight within the NAT HLA' --> INCORRECT. Training for North Atlantic operating procedures will not go into the details of dead reckoning and other fundamental navigation functions. Besides, 2 Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNS) are required for unrestricted access to the HLA. 'Familiarise the flight crew with the limitations of the long-range VHF communications systems used within the NAT HLA, and the deviations from normal VHF phraseology' --> INCORRECT. VHF communications are not considered as being 'long-range'. In the NAT HLA, HF communications are used to liaise with aeradio operators. 'Provide the flight crew with sufficient knowledge of SOPs in order to help them deal with any kind of abnormal situation while operating within the NAT HLA' --> INCORRECT. The problem with this answer is 'any kind of abnormal situation'. Crew will be trained in the most common abnormal situations, but it is unrealistic to cover any kind of the 1000's that could occur. 'Highlight the risks of complacency and lack of adherence of SOPs due to over-reliance on the provision and reliability of modern aeroplane systems' --> CORRECT. This is taken from ICAO Doc 007, as shown below. During long transatlantic flights, crews can become complacent and over rely on the aircraft's navigation and auto-flight systems. By maintaining SOP's the crew will ensure proper monitoring and cross checking during the flight.

Imagine being on one of many NAT parallel tracks, with aircraft stacked 1000 ft apart vertically above and below you. If you need to divert, then doing so safely will require obtaining a degree of separation from surrounding aircraft. In this event: 1. Separate laterally: turn left or right by at least 30o until 5NM off track and then parallel. Minimise descent during this phase. 2. Separate vertically. If you need to descend below NAT HLA, now descend to FL 280. Otherwise, if in RVSM airspace then split levels by 500 ft. Note: An simple way to detect correct and incorrect answers is to remember: Contingency scenarios climb or descent: 500 ft Weather avoidance climb or descent: 300 ft NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 13 13.2 GENERAL PROCEDURES 13.2.1 If an aircraft is unable to continue the flight in accordance with its ATC clearance, a revised clearance shall be obtained, whenever possible, prior to initiating any action. If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1) aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2) the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3) the direction to an alternate airport; 4) any strategic lateral offset being flown, and 5) terrain clearance;",

This is confirmed at the top of the display, where you can see differing positions for FMS 1 and FMS 2. It appears that one of the two FMS has failed, causing this disagreement. For unrestricted access in the NAT HLA, the aircraft must have at least two fully serviceable Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNSs). This can be: GNSS INS (INS has its own stand alone computer) IRS / FMC. (IRS sends its readings to the FMC to process) The flight crew should, therefore, investigate the faulty system and assess whether it is possible to continue the flight with reduced redundancy. ATC should be informed. Looking at the answers: 'Revert to dead reckoning navigation starting at the last plotted position since all navigation systems have failed and show incorrect information' --> INCORRECT. Not all navigation systems have failed. 'Identify and isolate the faulty system and establish whether it is possible to continue the flight as originally planned but with reduced redundancy' --> CORRECT. As discussed above. 'Notify ATC of the total navigation system failure and continue the flight while monitoring the performance of the faulty FMS in backup mode' --> INCORRECT. It is not a total navigation failure. 'Immediately descend to exit the NAT HLA since the navigation accuracy is uncertain and separation to adjacent traffic CANNOT be assured' --> INCORRECT. With one remaining FMS, the crew must inform ATC. Depending on the prevailing traffic conditions, ATC will decide on the best course of action. Besides, an immediate descent would be dangerous as there are many aircraft stacked vertically on NAT routes. Normally a descent is preceded by an offset of 5 NM. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 12 One System Fails After the OCA Boundary is Crossed 12.2.5 Once the aircraft has entered oceanic airspace, the flight crew should normally continue to operate the aircraft in accordance with the oceanic clearance already received, appreciating that the reliability of the total navigation system has been significantly reduced. 12.2.6 The flight crew should however, a) assess the prevailing circumstances (e.g. performance of the remaining system, remaining portion of the flight in the NAT HLA, etc.); b) prepare a proposal to ATC with respect to the prevailing circumstances (e.g. request clearance above or below the NAT HLA, turn-back, obtain clearance to fly along one of the special routes, etc.); c) advise and consult with ATC as to the most suitable action; d) obtain appropriate re-clearance prior to any deviation from the last acknowledged oceanic clearance.",

It should be recognised that these routes are within the NAT HLA, and that State approval must be obtained prior to flying along them. These routes are also available for interim use by aircraft normally approved for unrestricted NAT HLA operations that have suffered a partial loss of navigation capability and have only a single remaining functional LRNS. Detailed descriptions of the special routes known as ‘Blue Spruce Routes’ are included in Chapter 3 of this Document. Other routes also exist within the NAT HLA that may be flown by aircraft equipped with only a single functioning LRNS. These include routings between the Azores and the Portuguese mainland and/or the Madeira Archipelago and also routes between Northern Europe and Spain/Canaries/Lisbon FIR to the east of longitude 009° 01' W (viz. T9). Other routes available for single LRNS use are also established in the NAT HLA, including a route between Iceland and the east coast of Greenland and two routes between Kook Islands on the west coast of Greenland and Canada.

Operators should therefore devise procedures which will reduce this risk, as well as ensuring that the subject is covered during training.

However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

            "explanation": "This airport gives us 2 different approaches: A precision approach: ILS CAT I (DH: 240 feet, RVR/Visibility: 550 metres) A non-precision approach: LOC DME (MDH: 420 feet, RVR/Visibility: 1200 metres) In the event of a diversion to this airport, which approach would you plan to use? The ILS CAT I is a precision approach and so has lower minima, giving us a better chance to land successfully. Let's plan on using that. Using the planning requirements for an ETOPS en-route alternate, we need to add a factor to the minima. The idea is to degrade the equipment performance, but ensure the weather conditions will still allow for a successful approach in the time window. This way, when we actually arrive at the airport, the real minima will be met, even with inaccuracy in the weather forecasts. As calculated here: DH + 200 ft (240 ft + 200 ft = 440 ft) RVR / Visibility + 800 m (550 m + 800 m = 1350 m) So, check the forecast to ensure that the cloud ceiling is at or above 440 ft and check the RVR is forecast at or above 1350m during the relevant time window. On arrival, you will use a DH of 240 ft with an RVR of 550 m.",

The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component. Note: This question is now out of the scope of subject 071 and it has been moved to 022. However, it has been recently reported under Operational Procedures (071).",

Such an operator will have their own staff, acting under their approval. However, an operator may need to use another company to carry out work on their behalf (a contractor). For example, consider an airline who do not have their own staff at a remote base and so they may use a handling agent. We have 2 situations to consider in these questions: 1. The contractor DOES NOT hold their own approval (from an authority). No problem, they can still carry out the task, but under the operator's approval. 2. The contractor DOES hold their own approval. Now the contractor can carry out the work under their own approval. But the operator must check that the contractor is doing things properly by checking for compliance monitoring, risk management, holds the correct approvals etc. In either case, a written agreement is required between the operator and the contractor. A verbal agreement is insufficient and can't be verified by the authority. More information from the source material below. EASA AIR OPS ORO.

Drunken behaviour at check-in, at the gate, in sales offices, in lounges or on board the aircraft is in conflict with the goal to be a safe and secure airline and lowers the category of customer satisfaction experienced by other passengers. It also places additional and often unacceptable burdens on crew members and ground staff. Therefore, it's the operator's responsibility not to let drunk passengers board the aircraft if they are disruptive or aggressive and fail to show due consideration to other passengers and/or cabin personnel. The gate personnel or supervisor, senior cabin crew member will ask the passenger to comply with the rules. If possible, take the passenger aside before asking him/her to respect the rules. If the passenger repeatedly refuses to comply with the rules, the commander may use his/her authority to offload the passenger. Cabin crew are usually the ones who recognize whether a passenger is unfit to fly because of alcohol and inform the captain of the matter. Generally speaking, unless the senior cabin crew or the commander is unhappy to have the passenger on board, the commander might allow the intoxicated passenger to board the aircraft, under certain conditions, such as no more alcohol served, etc.",

However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

It is recommended that pilots should request their Oceanic Clearance at least 40 minutes prior to the Oceanic entry point ETA except when entering the Reykjavik area from the Scottish or Stavanger areas, then the clearance should be requested 20 minutes before the Oceanic entry point ETA. 5.1.5 At some airports situated close to oceanic boundaries or within the NAT Region, it may be necessary to obtain the Oceanic Clearance before departure. These procedures are detailed in relevant State AIPs, which should be consulted prior to departure. On the east side of the NAT, this will apply to departures from all Irish airfields, all UK airfields west of 2° 30'W and all French Airfields west of zero degree longitude.

Since this horizontal component becomes very weak near the magnetic poles, magnetic compasses are highly unreliable near the poles. Within these areas, air navigation tasks are further complicated by very rapid changes in magnetic variation over small distances. For example, when flying between the magnetic North Pole and the true North Pole, a heading of true North results in a magnetic heading of South (a magnetic variation of 180 degrees). The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate system is such that all meridians converge to the pole. This convergence also presents additional directional complications. When flying a great circle courses at latitudes greater than 67 degrees, convergence of the meridians can create rapid changes in true headings and true courses with small changes in aircraft position. As a result, relatively small errors in determining the aircraft's actual position can produce very large errors in determining the proper heading to fly and maintain the assigned flight path. When even small errors occur, very large navigation errors can develop over extremely short distances. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course can change several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantly altering the aircraft’s magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course.",

If you see this question in your exam, then please let us know, either in the comments, or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Looking at the answers: 'Once the passenger is on board, it is the Commander’s decision whether he/she travels, so the Commander should decide alone whether to offload him/her' --> INCORRECT. According to ICAO Annex 6, the commander has full authority once the doors are closed. Also, the wording \"the commander should decide alone\" is problematic as the commander should decide taking into account all relevant inputs such as the dispatcher and SCCM. 'The Commander should tell the passenger that he/she may travel on condition that he/she accepts that NO alcohol will be served on the flight' --> INCORRECT. Too little, too late. According to the question, the passenger is already drunk and therefore could endanger the flight. 'If the SCCM is happy for the passenger to travel, then the Commander should allow him/her to do so' --> INCORRECT. The commander can not ignore the dispatcher with the aircraft still on the ground and parked. The SCCM's input is valuable and to be considered but is not the whole picture. 'If the Dispatcher is requesting to offload the passenger, the Commander should assist in doing this' --> CORRECT. With the aircraft still on stand and the doors open, this is the best option. As mentioned above, feedback indicates this to be the correct option.",

Since this horizontal component becomes very weak near the magnetic poles, magnetic compasses are highly unreliable near the poles. Within these areas, air navigation tasks are further complicated by very rapid changes in magnetic variation over small distances. For example, when flying between the magnetic North Pole and the true North Pole, a heading of true North results in a magnetic heading of South (a magnetic variation of 180 degrees). The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate system is such that all meridians converge to the pole. This convergence also presents additional directional complications. When flying a great circle courses at latitudes greater than 67º, convergence of the meridians can create rapid changes in true headings and true courses with small changes in aircraft position. As a result, relatively small errors in determining the aircraft's actual position can produce very large errors in determining the proper heading to fly and maintain the assigned flight path. When even small errors occur, very large navigation errors can develop over extremely short distances. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course can change several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantly altering the aircraft’s magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course.",

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 8 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADS-C and ADS-B transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly self-selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when non-normal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude-keeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as “Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)”",

However, these flight duty limitations can be increased by a certain amount depending on conditions. Operations can increase the flight duty period by up to an hour if necessary, not more than 2 times per consecutive 7 days. Commanders can also use their discretion to extend the flight time up to 2 hours (3 hours with an augmented flight crew). However, this is where we run into the problem of the early report time. Due to the early report time being within the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL), between 02:00 and 05:59 hours, there are certain restrictions that occur to not only the flight duty period, but also any extensions. These restrictions become quite involved and complex, and do vary from operator to operator, so we cannot be sure precisely what extension EASA are allowing the commander to make using their discretion. We do know from EASA part ORO. FTL.205(f) that WOCL encroachment should be made part of any extension decision. The varying restrictions are not strong enough to reduce a 2 hour extension to 40 minutes only, so this leaves us only with the answer having the full 2 hours discretion, so 18:20 - 20:20 is the answer here For more information on flight duty period limitations and the WOCL see EASA part ORO.

In these circumstances, additional safety precautions are applied: The full number of cabin crew must be on board (the number corresponding to the minimum number of flight attendants for a flight). They must occupy their stations near the emergency exits (no catering handling, assisting passengers with baggage stowage, etc.). Passengers must be informed about fuelling in progress (by an on-board public address system and/or at the gate before boarding). The \"Fasten your seat belts\" sign must be switched off and passengers asked not to fasten their belts for quick evacuation. At least two escape paths depending on the size of the aircraft must be available (doors open with the bridge/airstairs connected or doors closed with an armed slide and the area below free from vehicles and objects for slide activation). Two-way communication maintained between personnel supervising refuelling and the cockpit for quick evacuation initiation. At most airports, fireman supervision or at least notification and monitoring through CCTV cameras is required. Such refuelling can only be done with low-risk fuels such as Jet A1. Wide-cute fuels and AVGAS are unsuitable due to their higher risk of ignition and hence can only be refuelled/de-fuelled if passengers are not on board, boarding nor disembarking.

Such ADS–C periodic reports, unlike event reports, contain wind and temperature data and thereby satisfy the MET authorities’ requirements for the provision of MET data. However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

            "explanation": "CPDLC: Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications needs to LOGON prior to flight, which is the establishment of communications between the aircraft and ATC. This initial LOGON is considered a manual action, as the crew will need to input some data, such as the flight number. Once logged in, the CPDLC will now automatically transfer between ATC centres along the flight. It is only the initial LOGON that is manual. During flight, the crew will always have to select the new radio frequency when transiting between different ATC centres. In the NAT HLA this will be on HF radio, due to it's long range, which uses the 2.8 MHz to 18 MHz frequency band. Looking at the answers: 'The pilot is then required to contact Santa Maria Oceanic control using VHF radio in the 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz frequency band' --> INCORRECT. In the NAT HLA you will be using HF and not VHF due the ranges involved. 'Contact Santa Maria via radio communication, using HF radio in the 2.8 MHz to 18 MHz frequency band' --> CORRECT. As discussed above. 'You need to contact/log on with Santa Maria to confirm automatic change' --> INCORRECT. The logon on CPDLC will happen automatically, no pilot action is required. The pilot will need to select the correct HF radio frequency. 'Do nothing as contact via CPDLC is transferred automatically' --> INCORRECT. CPDLC will transfer automatically but the pilot still has to select the HF frequency for radio calls. The answer 'do nothing' is incorrect. NAT Doc 007 HF Voice Communications 6.1.3 Even with the growing use of data link communications a significant volume of NAT air/ground communications are conducted using voice on SSB HF frequencies and GP VHF frequencies. To support air/ground ATC communications in the North Atlantic region, twenty-four HF frequencies have been allocated, in bands ranging from 2.8 to 18 MHz. Additionally, Shanwick Radio, Santa Maria Radio, and Iceland Radio operate a number of Regional and Domestic Air Route Area (RDARA) frequencies in accordance with operating requirements and agreements between the stations. The integrity of the ATC service remains wholly dependent on establishing and maintaining HF or VHF voice communications with each ATS unit along the route of flight. Prior to or upon entering each NAT oceanic CTA, the flight crew should contact the appropriate aeronautical radio station.",

No reduction needed for multi-sectors (crew performs only 2 sectors) Operator has extended the normal FDP (13 h) by 1 h, which is the maximum allowed by the operator. On top of the above extension, the commander may, due to unforseen circumstances, extend the normal maximum FDP by one more hour. 8:15 + 14 = 22:15 (end of the extended FDP).

An IRS sends it's data to the FMC for calculations. Therefore, the loss of an FMC means the loss of a LRNS. The Tango Routes, often referred to as the Three Sisters, are oceanic routes which are permanent and run north - south. As oceanic routes, they require 2 LRNS except for T9 and T290, which are close enough to shore to require only ONE LRNS. In this question, the failure of an FMC implies that the aircraft has only one LRNS remaining. As the aircraft is routing to the south, T9 is the only realistic option, other than to re-route via domestic airspace closer to shore. T9 is a south bound only track and T290 is north bound. Looking at the answers: 'Airway T16 may be used as planned since the aeroplane maintains Its navigation capability with the remaining FMS'. --> INCORRECT. T16 is further into the ocean and would need 2 LRNS. 'The aircraft should return to the departure aerodrome as flight with only one FMS means that NO redundancy exists and is forbidden'. --> INCORRECT. Flight is permitted with only 1 LRNS via T9, T290 or continuing via domestic airspace, ie, around the French coast. 'The pilots must request a reroute via T290 or T9 since the aeroplane has only one serviceable LRNS'. --> CORRECT. T9 requires only 1 LRNS and routes south bound as fits the scenario in the question. T290 is for north bound traffic but the examiner seems happy with this. 'The pilots must avoid NAT HLA since entry to NAT HLA is forbidden with only one serviceable LRNS'. --> INCORRECT.

            "explanation": "STATIC WICKS Static wicks are long, thin extensions that are often attached to the outboard trailing edges of wings and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Friction generated as an aircraft moves through the air can cause a buildup of static electricity. The wick transfers that electricity back into the atmosphere to prevent it from interfering with navigation and communication radios. Static wicks dissipate precipitation static that can develop as you fly through areas of uncharged particles. These particles can exist as you fly through solid or liquid particles such as rain, snow, fog, dust or ash. As the airplane flies through the particles, positive charges deflect and negative charges attach to the airframe, building up and eventually discharging at certain points of the airframe where the static wicks are generally attached. Without the wicks, there is potential for audio disturbances, weak radio transmissions and even complete loss of communication.

Operators’ SOPs are generally consistent in regard to the importance of properly handing over, and taking control, and if adopted with due diligence, would forestall the development of an error. Note: The examiner seems to have chosen a very distinct use of English here, for the answer: 'The waypoints in the FMS are NOT correct and the FMS will provide Inaccurate guidance' The route should be changed towards PIKIL and track D. So, the current route is now wrong. The waypoints themselves are correct, you just need to amend the selection of waypoints. Saying the waypoints are not correct indicates that the waypoint is incorrectly labelled or positioned and there is a problem with the database. The FMS will provide accurate guidance as long as the pilot selects the appropriate waypoints to construct the desired route.",

            "explanation": "Lots of opportunity for confusion, so let's look at the phraseology needed for this exam: Skills Test: The flying test that completes training on a type rating course (with circuits to come). Licence Proficiency Check (LPC): Renewal of the type rating / IR - done every 12 months. Operator Proficiency Check (OPC): Effectively a mini IR and done between LPC's. The elements tested in an OPC are also done on the full LPC - so you end up doing 2 OPC's in every 12 months. For example: Complete the skills test and type rating 31st December. Now valid for 12 months. LPC must be done by the following 31st December, but can be done (for operational flexibility) anytime within 3 months prior to this date, ie in October, November or December. The new validity would be for 12 months from the original expiry though. Mid year, you will need to do an OPC. In this example, by 30th June. Again there is a 3 month window to complete this check, allowing for operational flexibility. Looking at the answer: 2 within a year, more than 3 months between checks --> CORRECT. You will do an OPC in mid year as it is valid for 6 months, and again as part of the annual LPC, so 2 in a year. Using the above example, it is possible to do the first OPC on the 30th June (at the latest) and then the second on the 1st October (at the earliest). There must always be at least 3 months between OPC's. Finally, regarding the OPC / 12 month questions: This relates ONLY TO SPECIALISED TASKS. For example, an operator is certified to carry out the spraying of detergent on oil slicks. This is clearly a specialised task as it involves low level flying and unique operating conditions. This skill is tested every year by the operator using an OPC. Here, the crew will have to fly a dummy run and demonstrate competency in this operation. Although this is also a check in proficiency by the operator (OPC), it is for a different skill set and by regulation, has a 12 month validity. More on this can be found below. Note: If the question mentions specialised tasks, the answer is 12 months. If not, then we are talking about the mini IR and so it's 6 months and 2 in a year. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) 2015/140 ORO. FC.230 Recurrent training and checking (a) Each flight crew member shall complete recurrent training and checking relevant to the type or variant of aircraft on which they operate. (b) Operator proficiency check (1) Each flight crew member shall complete operator proficiency checks as part of the normal crew complement to demonstrate competence in carrying out normal, abnormal and emergency procedures. (2) When the flight crew member will be required to operate under IFR, the operator proficiency check shall be conducted without external visual reference, as appropriate. (3) The validity period of the operator proficiency check shall be six calendar months.

Nevertheless, we aim to gather additional feedback to ensure absolute accuracy regarding the correct option. Therefore, if you encounter this question in your official exam, kindly inform us for further assessment. When a cabin crew member is detected with the smell of alcohol during the briefing, it is important for the commander to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of the flight. Option b) suggests asking the authorities to check the crew member's blood alcohol levels to determine if they are under the legal limit. This action is necessary because alcohol impairs cognitive and physical abilities, which can affect the crew member's performance and judgment during the flight. Flight safety is of paramount importance, and having a crew member under the influence of alcohol poses risks to the operation and the well-being of passengers. It is important to consider that certain medical conditions can lead to the smell of alcohol. For example, if your blood sugar remains consistently high for an extended period, it may cause your breath to have an odor resembling alcohol. Therefore, obtaining an accurate assessment is crucial to determine the actual cause of the smell and ensure appropriate actions are taken. By involving the authorities to conduct a blood alcohol test, the commander can obtain an objective and accurate assessment of the crew member's condition. This ensures that any decision made regarding their participation in the flight is based on factual information rather than subjective observations. If the crew member is found to have exceeded the legal limit for alcohol consumption, denying them access to the aircraft is crucial to maintain flight safety. It is essential to have a sober and alert crew to handle any emergencies or challenges that may arise during the flight. EASA AIR OPS GM1 NCC. GEN.105(e)(2) Crew responsibilities GENERAL In accordance with 7.g. of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 216/20081 (essential requirements for air operations), a crew member must not perform duties on board an aircraft when under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol or when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness or other similar causes.

The approach lights are one of the visual references which allow a descent below MDA/H. 'The approach cannot be continued below the MDA/H unless an element of the threshold(markings or lights), is distinctly visible and identifiable' --> INCORRECT.

This role is sometimes called the cabin manager, purser etc depending on the airline. The SCCM is responsible directly to the commander, who retains overall authority on board the aircraft. This situation is much the same as for pilots. With multiple crew on board, there is an obvious need for a seniority system.

CC.100 Number and composition of cabin crew (a) For the operation of aircraft with an MOPSC of more than 19, at least one cabin crew member shall be assigned when carrying one or more passenger(s). (b) For the purpose of complying with point (a), the minimum number of cabin crew members shall be the greatest number amongst the following: (1) the number of cabin crew members established during the aircraft certification process in accordance with the applicable certification specifications, for the aircraft cabin configuration used by the operator; (2) if the number under point (1) has not been established, the number of cabin crew members established during the aircraft certification process for the maximum certified passenger seating configuration reduced by 1 for every whole multiple of 50 passenger seats of the aircraft cabin configuration used by the operator falling below the maximum certified seating capacity; (3) one cabin crew member for every 50, or fraction of 50, passenger seats installed on the same deck of the aircraft to be operated. (c) For operations with more than one cabin crew member, the operator shall nominate one cabin crew member accountable to the pilot-in-command or the commander. (d) By way of derogation from point (a), non-commercial operations with aircraft with an MOPSC of more than 19 may be performed without an operating cabin crew member, subject to the prior approval by the competent authority. To obtain the approval, the operator shall ensure that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) there are maximum 19 passengers on board; (2) the operator has developed procedures for that operation.",

You need to know the flight time as it is the basis for determining the end of the flight duty and thus also the duty periods. Note: Flight duty time is an example of a duty time. Looking at the incorrect answers: Airborne time --> INCORRECT. This is the time from take-off until landing. If a flight is to be considered a cross-country flight --> INCORRECT. Cross country flights are any flight beyond a certain distance from the departure airfield. When the MEL cannot be applied --> INCORRECT. The MEL is intended to be used when parked on the ground and then the abnormal and emergency check lists are to used when the aircraft is in motion. However, the extent of the MEL states that it can be considered by the commander at any time to enhance situational awareness and safety decisions. More information can be found here: ICAO Annex 6 Chapter. Definitions Duty. Any task that flight or cabin crew members are required by the operator to perform, including, for example, flight duty, administrative work, training, positioning and standby when it is likely to induce fatigue. Flight time - aeroplanes. The total time from the moment an aeroplane first moves for the purpose of taking-off until the moment it finally comes to rest at the end of the flight. Flight duty period. A period which commences when a flight or cabin crew member is required to report for duty that includes a flight or a series of flights and which finishes when the aircraft finally comes to rest and the engines are shut down at the end of the last flight on which he/she is a crew member.",

Nevertheless, in view of the significant change of operating environment (i.e. to indirect surveillance and communications) it is recommended that a final confirmation of the aircraft systems serviceability is performed immediately prior to entering the NAT HLA. Check to ensure the two primary altimeters are reading within 200 feet of each other (or lesser value if specified in your aircraft’s flight manual). Conduct this check while at level flight. You should also note the stand-by altimeter reading. The readings of the primary and standby altimeters should be recorded to be available for use in any possible contingency situations.",

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: (.) 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or Note: Descent below FL 290 is considered particularly applicable to operations where there is a predominant traffic flow (e.g. east-west) or parallel track system where the aircraft’s diversion path will likely cross adjacent tracks or routes. A descent below FL 290 can decrease the likelihood of: conflict with other aircraft, ACAS RA events and delays in obtaining a revised ATC clearance. b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.",

(b) The deployment of integral aircraft stairs or the opening of emergency exits as a prerequisite to refueling is not necessarily required. OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES — AEROPLANES (c) Operational procedures should specify that at least the following precautions are taken: (1) one qualified person should remain at a specified location during fueling operations with passengers on board. This qualified person should be capable of handling emergency procedures concerning fire protection and firefighting, handling communications, and initiating and directing an evacuation; (2) two-way communication should be established and should remain available by the aeroplane's inter-communication system or other suitable means between the ground crew supervising the refueling and the qualified personnel on board the aeroplane; the involved personnel should remain within easy reach of the system of communication; (3) crew, personnel and passengers should be warned that re/defueling will take place; (4) ‘Fasten Seat Belts’ signs should be off; (5) ‘NO SMOKING’ signs should be on, together with interior lighting to enable emergency exits to be identified; (6) passengers should be instructed to unfasten their seat belts and refrain from smoking; (7) the minimum required number of cabin crew should be on board and be prepared for an immediate emergency evacuation; (8) if the presence of fuel vapour is detected inside the aeroplane, or any other hazard arises during re/defueling, fuelling should be stopped immediately; (9) the ground area beneath the exits intended for emergency evacuation and slide deployment areas should be kept clear at doors where stairs are not in position for use in the event of evacuation; and (10) provision is made for a safe and rapid evacuation.",

About 40 minutes before reaching the ocean, you need to call for an Oceanic clearance. 40 minutes away from the ocean means you are somewhere over the UK, France etc. You call for this oceanic clearance on comms 2. You are working the European domestic controller (British, French etc.) on comms 1. Your oceanic clearance is to enter via point BERUX. This is a clearance to enter the oceanic airspace at this point only. The oceanic controller does not control you until you enter their airspace, some 40 minutes away. You now need to speak with domestic ATC on comms 1, to request a re-clearance to turn towards BERUX. Looking at the answers: 'Request and obtain a re-clearance from ATC to fly to BERUX' --> CORRECT. As described above. 'Fly to BEGAS, and when reaching BEGAS fly on to BERUX' --> INCORRECT. Flying to BEGAS and then along the oceanic boundary to BERUX is a waste of time and fuel. 'Turn towards BERUX 5 minutes before reaching BEGAS' --> INCORRECT. This is a randomly made up time. In reality, you would look to turn sooner to save track miles by obtaining the re-clearance from the domestic ATC. 'Programme the FMS to fly direct to BERUX from the way-point BEGAS' ---> INCORRECT. As with another answer, flying to BEGAS and then along the oceanic boundary to BERUX is a waste of time and fuel. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL CHAPTER 5: OCEANIC ATC CLEARANCES 5.1.8 If any of the route, flight level or Mach Number in the clearance differs from that flight planned, requested or previously cleared, attention may be drawn to such changes when the clearance is delivered (whether by voice or by data link). Pilots should pay particular attention when the issued clearance differs from the Flight Plan. (N. B. a significant proportion of navigation errors investigated in the NAT involve an aircraft which has followed its Flight Plan rather than its differing clearance). 5.1.9 Furthermore it must be recognised that if the entry point of the oceanic route on which the flight is cleared differs from that originally requested and/or the oceanic flight level differs from the current flight level, the pilot is responsible for requesting and obtaining the necessary domestic re-clearance to ensure that the flight is in compliance with its Oceanic Clearance when entering oceanic airspace.",

An operator is considered non-complex or complex depending on the size and scale of the operation. One of the important aspects of this distinction, is the requirement for management structure. For example, a start up company with one owner / pilot and one aircraft is clearly non-complex and the owner / pilot will have to fulfil many of the management functions. A large, complex company such as Air France, British Airways etc will require a very different management structure covering areas such as flight operations ground operations maintenance training AMC1 ORO. GEN.200(b) Management system SIZE, NATURE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTIVITY (a) An operator should be considered as complex when it has a workforce of more than 20 full time equivalents (FTEs) involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200848 and its Implementing Rules. (b) Operators with up to 20 FTEs involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200849 and its Implementing Rules may also be considered complex based on an assessment of the following factors: (1) in terms of complexity, the extent and scope of contracted activities subject to the approval; (2) in terms of risk criteria, the extent of the following: (i) operations requiring a specific approval; (ii) high-risk commercial specialised operations; (iii) operations with different types of aircraft used; and (iv) operations in challenging environment (offshore, mountainous area, etc.).",

As prevailing visibility is usually used, which is approximately the average visibility in all directions from the station, this can be a bit inaccurate, as the visibility can vary massively between two different directions, due to different density of obscuration, perhaps. This is why, when the visibility is below 1500 m, the RVR is reported also, as the RVR (Runway Visual Range) is a measure of the exact visibility directly down the runway, and usually is measured at 3 different places on the runway, touchdown zone, midpoint, and stop-end. This is almost always higher than the prevailing visibility, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers). In terms of this question, the runway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of centreline markings or lights that can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so those two answers must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is the runway edge lights, which you should be able to see also. The other options are either to the side of the runway (in a direction where visibility is not assured), or behind the aircraft when lined up.",

Most air transport aircraft use Chemical generators to provide passengers with oxygen (Boeings use gaseous). Generators and masks are in containers above the passenger seats, in the lavatories, in each galley, and at each cabin crew station. OPERATION For Chemical Oxygen Systems, each container has an electrical latching mechanism that opens automatically to allow the masks to drop, if the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15 000 ft. The flight crew can override the automatic control. A manual release tool allows crewmembers to manually open the doors in case of electrical failure. The generation of oxygen begins when the passenger pulls the mask towards the passenger seat. Once the generator is activated, the flow of oxygen is constant (whether or not the mask is being worn) for approximately 15 minutes, until the generator is exhausted. In line with the oxygen supply to the passenger mask, there is a small bag. This should partially inflate during use, indicating that there is a supply of oxygen. A mixture of oxygen together with cabin air will be supplied. Thus the masks will not protect the passenger from smoke and fumes. The chemical reaction used for oxygen generation creates heat (the generator itself incorporates a heat shield). Therefore, the smell of burning or smoke, and cabin temperature increase, may be associated with the normal operation of the oxygen generators.",

V - SPA - specific approvals for ETOPs, Dangerous Goods, Low Visibility Operations etc VI - NCC - non commercial with complex aircraft, operating private jets etc. VII - NCO - non commercial with non complex aircraft, operating a Piper Warrior for example VII - SPA - specialised operations for aerial work, such as pollution spraying, banner towing, crop spraying etc. For a commercial airline, annexes III, IV and V are the most relevant. If the operator plans on carrying dangerous goods (DG) then all 3 annexes contain relevant information to obtain this approval.

            "explanation": "There are 2 aspects to be clear on, in order to answer this question: 1. After take-off, the requirement is to use the operating minima only. The ceiling is taken into account only for ETOPS, Non-Precision & Circling approaches in planning minima. The following table is a summary for the application of planning and operating minima. Stage of flight? Pre-flight (in the ops room) Dispatch / taxiing After take-off / en-route Which minima? Planning minima Planning minima Operating minima Time? +/- 1 hour ETA ETA Operating minima is Visibility / RVR only. 2. Continuation of approach: Under European regulations, you can always commence an approach. However, to continue the approach below the outer marker (not below 1000 ft above the aerodrome) then the reported visibility / RVR must be the same or greater than what is required for the approach. For example: you are flying a CAT I ILS, with a DH of 200 ft and an RVR of 550 m. On the approach, ATC report RVR 400 m - you may not descend below 1000 ft. If they report RVR 600 m, then you may descend below 1000 ft agl and continue down to DH. At DH, further descent is based on seeing the required visual references. The idea behind this regulation is to prevent low approaches in visibility conditions that will likely result in a go-around. Cloud base and ceiling are not a factor - only visibility / RVR. Note: Once below 1000 ft agl, if the visibility / RVR now decreases to below minima, then you can continue down to DH anyway. In this question - you are flying a non-precision approach, but the ceiling / MDH are not relevant as you are using operating minima. The reported visibility of 1800 m exceeds your required 1500 m so you may continue down to minimums. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP. MPA.305 Commencement and continuation of approach (a) The commander or the pilot to whom conduct of the flight has been delegated may commence an instrument approach regardless of the reported RVR/VIS. (b) If the reported RVR/VIS is less than the applicable minimum the approach shall not be continued: (1) below 1 000 ft above the aerodrome; or (2) into the final approach segment in the case where the DA/H or MDA/H is more than 1 000 ft above the aerodrome. (c) Where the RVR is not available, RVR values may be derived by converting the reported visibility. (d) If, after passing 1 000 ft above the aerodrome, the reported RVR/VIS falls below the applicable minimum, the approach may be continued to DA/H or MDA/H. (e) The approach may be continued below DA/H or MDA/H and the landing may be completed provided that the visual reference adequate for the type of approach operation and for the intended runway is established at the DA/H or MDA/H and is maintained. (f) The touchdown zone RVR shall always be controlling. If reported and relevant, the midpoint and stop end RVR shall also be controlling. The minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 125 m or the RVR required for the touchdown zone if less, and 75 m for the stop end. For aircraft equipped with a roll out guidance or control system, the minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 75 m",

Accountable Manager: Holds ultimate responsibility and authority for the safety and compliance of the operator. Safety Manager: Manages the day to day operation and effectiveness of the operator's Safety Management System (SMS). Here we are asked who would be the post-holder responsible for the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programme. This is describing the safety manager. The safety manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SMS safety management system, which includes FDM. For a smaller operator (Non complex) this is typically the accountable manager or a line Captain. Both of these positions offer sufficient relevant experience in operational roles to be an effective safety manager. For a larger operator (Complex) this position would now need a more dedicated specialist due to the size or type of operation. Now the operator will need a safety manager and safety review board. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) 2015/1329 ORO. AOC.130 Flight data monitoring – aeroplanes (a) The operator shall establish and maintain a flight data monitoring programme, which shall be integrated in its management system, for aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-off mass of more than 27 000 kg.

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1)aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2)the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3)the direction to an alternate airport; 4)any strategic lateral offset being flown and, 5)terrain clearance 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK If possible maintain the assigned flight level until established on the 9.3 km (5.0 NM) parallel, same direction track or route offset. If unable, initially minimize the rate of descent to the extent that is operationally feasible. 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.

Be aware that for some airports located close to oceanic boundaries oceanic clearances may be obtained before departure. Indeed on the east side of the NAT this will apply to departures from all Irish airfields, all UK airfields west of 2 degrees 30 minutes West and all French Airfields west of 0 degrees longitude. Flights leaving airports in Iceland, Faeroes, or Greenland will receive oceanic clearances prior to departure. Therefore, the correct answer is \"All airports in Iceland.\".",

The effect of these flows is to concentrate most of the traffic uni-directionally, with peak westbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 1130 UTC and 1900 UTC and peak eastbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 0100 UTC and 0800 UTC. 2.1.2 The flight levels normally associated with the OTS are FL310 to FL400 inclusive. These flight levels, and their use have been negotiated and agreed by the NATS ATS providers and are published as the Flight Level Allocation Scheme (FLAS). (See Attachment 5). The FLAS also determines flight levels available for traffic routing partly or wholly outside of the OTS as well as flights operating outside of the valid time periods of the OTS; often referred to as “transition times’. 2.1.3 The hours of validity of the two Organised Track Systems (OTS) are as follows: (Westbound) Day-time OTS 1130 UTC to 1900 UTC at 30°W (Eastbound) Night-time OTS 0100 UTC to 0800 UTC at 30°W",

Note: PBCS tracks will be identified in Note 3 of the OTS message. Operators planning to operate in the altitude band FL350-390 on the PBCS OTS are subject to equipage and authorization requirements as outlined in NAT OPS Bulletin, “Implementation of Performance Based Separation Minima”. 4.1.12 Operators may include climbs in the flight plan, although each change of level during flight must be requested from ATC by the flight crew.

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Should decompression take place it is critical for the crew to individually don oxygen masks and check flow as quickly as possible. Any delay caused by helping other members of the crew or passengers could have catastrophic results for all the occupants of the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Looking at the answer options: 1. High wind velocity --> CORRECT. This can disturb the anti-icing fluid or even blow it off the aircraft. 2. Light wind velocity --> INCORRECT. Light or calm winds will not disturb the protective fluid. 3. Ambient temperature above 0 degrees Celsius --> INCORRECT. Warm temperatures are good news for hold over times. 4. High relative humidity --> CORRECT. The higher the water content of the air, the more contamination on the aircraft as it cools on the surface. 5. Aeroplane skin temperature above the ambient temperature --> INCORRECT. If the aircraft is warmer than ambient, this will discourage contamination. Be careful, a cold soaked wing is detrimental to hold over time, as an aircraft following a long cruise will have a very cold skin and low temperature fuel in the tanks. 6. Low concentration of anti-icing fluid in the anti-icing fluid/water mix --> CORRECT. The more the anti-icing fluid is diluted, then the less effective it is. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.2 HOT is the estimated time the anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of ice and frost and the accumulation of snow on the protected (treated) surfaces of an aeroplane. These HOTs are generated by testing fluids under a variety of temperature and precipitation conditions that simulate the range of weather experienced in winter. 4.3 Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

            "explanation": "The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) or Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) was developed in order to reduce the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft. It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the ACAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during an ACAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. When there is a collision danger between two aircraft, the ACAS systems of these aircraft will inform the pilots in the form of Resolution Advisory (RA) giving them instructions to follow. The ACAS systems of the two aircraft are communicating with each other in order to provide the pilots with non-contradicting instructions (i.e one aircraft may instructed to climb and the other to descend). The ATC is usually unaware of the onset of a Resolution Advisory (RA) and the respective instructions given to the pilots. That is the reason why after following the Resolution Advisory (RA), the pilot shall notify the ATC as soon as possible. Note: After the response to an ACAS RA is completed, a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated. (ICAO Doc 4444)",

A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing engine trouble. Ditching—a forced or precautionary landing on water.",

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

One stage de-icing / anti-icing is where heated anti-icing fluid is applied to the aircraft surfaces; the heat de-ices the aircraft, and the fluid remains on the aircraft to provide sufficient anti-icing capability. The holdover time begins at the start of the single stage. Two stage de-icing / anti-icing means that the first stage applies a dedicated de-icing fluid, and then the second stage applies a dedicated anti-icing fluid. The holdover time begins at the start of the second (anti-icing) stage. The given holdover time is the time that the aircraft is sufficiently clear of icing and contaminants for, and if the aircraft does not take off within this time, they must return to be de-iced / anti-iced again.

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

The order of reporting should be from the threshold having the lower runway designation number, e.g. 4/5/4. Suitable combinations of numbers may be used to indicate varying conditions over runway segments. If more than one deposit is present on the same portion of the runway, they should be reported in sequence from the top to the bottom of the total deposit, e.g. 57/56/57. Drifts, depths of deposit appreciably greater than the average values or other significant characteristics of the deposits may be reported under Item T in plain language.

            "explanation": "Because the wear mechanisms are different between carbon and steel brakes, different taxi braking techniques are recommended for carbon brakes in order to maximize brake life. Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear. Landing with a tailwind will increase the landing distance, since the runway length is limited, it requires greater brake energy. Wear mechanisms are different between carbon and steel brakes. In carbon brakes, one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications but in steel brakes, maximum lifetime can be achieved by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for cooling between applications. From this point of view, using carbon brakes when landing with a tailwind is more favorable.",

            "explanation": "A difficult question as there are 2 possible scenarios being asked: 1. The formation of the vortex - outward along the span under the wing, then upwards around the wingtip towards the lower pressure above the wing. 2. The path of the vortices once formed - outwards and downwards from the wing tips, descending typically 1000 ft over 3 minutes before dissipating. Feedback over several years confirms the examiner is asking about the first scenario - the formation of the vortices. WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

As brakes stop the aircraft by friction, the kinetic energy of the aircraft, proportional to its mass and the speed at which it is moving, is converted into heat. When a brake becomes overheated, the metal (or carbon compound) loses its properties - it starts getting soft and deforms. The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off. This depends on the aircraft's mass, the speed when braking was commenced, the intensity of brakes applied and the ambient temperatures.",
