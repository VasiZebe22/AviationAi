We do not believe this should be in air law but current feedback says that it is. Any further feedback would be appreciated, thank you. Lets go through each item: Airborne receiver tolerance - This is the tolerance of the airborne receivers, such as the VOR receiver or ADF, and does affect the accuracy/tolerance of a fix. ATC tolerance - This is not a real thing. Ground equipment tolerance - The margin for error in a VOR transmitter, for example. This does affect the tolerance of a fix. Flight technical tolerance - This is the tolerance with which the aircraft is being flown, and is an odd choice for this question, but does also include display errors and innacuracies reading the instruments, which affect fix accuracy and tolerance area. Weather tolerance - The weather should not affect navigational fixes (except NDB thunderstorm effect, but this is covered in ground/airborne equipment error).",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the TCAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. Pilots must NOT request an altitude clearance from ATC before performing the Resolution Advisory Manoeuvre. The manoeuvre should be followed immediately, as TCAS RAs override ATC authority until clear of conflict.",

The Mode C reply provides the air traffic control system with altitude information in increments of 100 ft, typically updating every 12 seconds. This information helps air traffic controllers maintain vertical separation between aircraft in controlled airspace. The tolerance value used by ATC to determine that Mode C derived level information displayed to the controller is accurate, is the reported altitude/level ± 300 ft. Mode C altitude reply increments → 100 ft Mode C altitude reply tolerance → 300 ft from the reported altitude/level",

ICAO Doc 4444 6.5.4.3 If visual reference to terrain is established before completion of the approach procedure, the entire procedure must nevertheless be executed unless the aircraft requests and is cleared for a visual approach. 6.5.3.3 An IFR flight may be cleared to execute a visual approach provided the pilot can maintain visual reference to the terrain and: a) the reported ceiling is at or above the level of the beginning of the initial approach segment for the aircraft so cleared; or b) the pilot reports at the level of the beginning of the initial approach segment or at any time during the instrument approach procedure that the meteorological conditions are such that with reasonable assurance a visual approach and landing can be completed. The runway environment includes features such as the runway threshold or approach lighting aids or other markings identifiable with the runway. The pilot has the runway lights of aerodrome C in sight. A missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. Since the pilot has the runway lights of airport C in sight, he may execute the approach procedure until 1000 ft above aerodrome elevation or the final approach segment if the DH or MDH is higher than 1000 ft, and then request a visual approach. The reason the pilot would normally choose airport C is because of the fuel emergency that leads to a distress condition, since airport C is the nearest suitable airport and the aircraft should land as soon as possible.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question was created based on incomplete feedback. If you encounter it in your official exam, please inform us. The information provided by ACAS II is intended to assist flight crew in the safe operation of an aeroplane by providing advice on appropriate action to reduce the risk of collision. This is achieved through Resolution Advisories (RAs), which propose manoeuvres, and through Traffic Advisories (TAs), which are intended to prompt visual acquisition and to act as a warning that an RA may follow. Traffic Advisory (TA) means a caution to the flight crew that an aircraft has become a potential collision threat. Resolution Advisory (RA) means a warning to the flight crew of an imminent collision threat, combined with commands for the crew to use in avoiding an airborne collision. When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane. In nearly all cases, it's crucial to adhere to ACAS' guidance. There are only a few exceptions when you should not immediately respond to an RA: If you receive a stall warning, further maneuvering could lead to a stall. If there is a windshear warning, use all available aircraft performance to escape the windshear threat. If there is a ground proximity warning, use all available aircraft performance to avoid terrain closure. Note: In this instance, we find that the option \"terrain alert\" is not as applicable since the TCAS RA specifically directs the aircraft to \"CLIMB\".",

Independent parallel approaches do not have to be radar vectored, though, even though most are. They can be placed onto the final approach path procedurally, but the procedure has to be a viable one for independent parallel approaches (no procedure turn for ILS/MLS approaches, for example).",

The vertical cross-section of each segment is divided into primary and secondary areas. Full obstacle clearances are applied over the primary areas reducing to zero at the outer edges of the secondary areas ( 1.3.2 On straight segments, the width of the primary area at any given point is equal to one-half of the total width. The width of each secondary area is equal to one-quarter of the total width. 1.3.3 Where no track guidance is provided during a turn specified by the procedure, the total width of the area is considered primary area. 1.3.4 The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) is provided for the whole width of the primary area. In the secondary area, MOC is provided at the inner edges reducing to zero at the outer edges ( We are interested in how the primary and secondary areas are established in this question.

In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation).

The regulation and associated AMCs and guidance materials define the priveleges of each approval, and how the operator must operate to apply and maintain that approval. The option \"any specialised operation where the aircraft is used for specialised activities.\" looks incorrect to us, as Part-SPA does not define each individual flight/operation, but instead lays out the framework for operators to operate under each approval. It is quite difficult to describe, but we highly recommend taking a quick look at EASA's easy access rules for air operations, part-SPA, where you can have a look at the rules and regulations yourself, and get a good idea of what they are used for.",

            "explanation": "Note: The wording here might be slightly different than in the exam, the feedback was unclear about it. Please let us know if you see the question and how it was phrased, thank you! Short explanation: The Boeing 777 falls under the C/D category aircraft, with a reference height of 420 ft (plus an additional 50 ft for operational considerations). Precision approach: decision altitude or height (DA/DH): Category C/D aircraft: 420 ft (with 50 ft added for operational reasons). Therefore, the calculation simplifies to: DH = 420 ft + 50 ft = 470 ft Detailed explanation: So one part of this question is asking you to choose from MDH or DH. Decision Height (DH) refers to precision approaches, and is the lowest height above the runway threshold where the pilot must begin a missed approach, if the runway is not yet in sight. So operationally, it is where you decide to continue if visual, or begin the go-around procedure if you are not yet visual. Minimum Descent Height (MDH) refers to non-precision approaches (NPAs), and is a relic of the past, where NPAs could be flown by descending to the MDA/H and flying level until visual with the runway or the missed approach point. So therefore, as we are dealing with a precision approach here, the answer begins with DH. The next job is to work out what the DH of the approach will be for that B777. It is a very large aircraft and accompanies approach categories C/D (two categories because its circling speed puts it in a different category to the VAT speed). The approach category of an aircraft depends on its VAT speed (speed over the threshold) at MLM (maximum landing mass), or circling minima, which can give it two categories, as mentioned above. Having categories for this means that different approach speeds can be taken into account for obstacle clearance, circle to land and go-around manoeuvres. As the B777 category is C/D, we can use 420 ft, plus the 50 ft addition (it is very common to add a small amount like this, for different corrections and safety margin, decided by the operator). Therefore our answer is DH = 470 ft.",

It provides Traffic Advisory (TA) informing the flight crew of nearby aircraft that could pose a potential collision risk, and Resolution Advisory (RA) alerting pilots of an imminent risk of collision and giving guidance on how to maneuver the aircraft to avoid the potential collision. The ability of ACAS to fulfil its role of assisting pilots in the avoidance of potential collisions is dependent on the correct and timely response by pilots to ACAS indications. ACAS RA has priority over any other ATC instruction, and the crew must immediately follow it without ATC confirmation. However, pilots should inform ATC as soon as possible about their deviations due to ACAS RA. Pilots should not rely on their visual observations when responding to an ACAS RA (Resolution Advisory), especially at night, because what they see visually may not always correspond to the aircraft that the ACAS system has identified as a collision threat. Pilots should follow the guidance provided by the ACAS system to ensure safe collision avoidance. ICAO Doc 8168 Volume III 3.2 USE OF ACAS INDICATIONS The indications generated by ACAS shall be used by pilots in conformity with the following safety considerations: c) in the event of an RA, pilots shall: 1) respond immediately by following the RA as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardize the safety of the aeroplane; Note 2.— Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic causing an RA. Visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at night. 2) follow the RA even if there is a conflict between the RA and an air traffic control (ATC) instruction to manoeuvre; 4) as soon as possible, as permitted by flight crew workload, notify the appropriate ATC unit of any RA which requires a deviation from the current ATC instruction or clearance; (.)",

The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5.

Let's see each choice individually: The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating. This choice is correct. If the approach is executed with a higher speed, it may be difficult for the aircraft to decelerate after touchdown and come to stop within the available runway length. The aircraft may struggle to touch down precisely at the desired point, leading to an extended touchdown point and requiring additional runway to come to a stop. You may land before the threshold to get more braking distance. Braking distance becomes critical when approaching a short runway. Landing before the threshold is not allowed and not considered an option, so this choice is wrong. Nothing, you can make it This choice could be correct as well, but we choose the option \"The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating.\" Please provide further feedback if available. The aircraft will automatically adjust its landing speed to match the shorter runway length. The landing speed of an aircraft is determined by factors such as aircraft type, weight, approach configuration, and wind conditions. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the aircraft is operated within safe landing parameters, regardless of the length of the runway. Simply landing on a shorter runway does not trigger an automatic adjustment of the aircraft's landing speed.",

When a RA occurs, the Flight Crew must notify the appropriate ATC unit as soon as possible, as permitted by Flight Crew workload, in the following manner: \"Company 123, TCAS RA standby\" If the pilot is unable to comply with an ATC clearance or instruction because there is a RA, the appropriate response is: \"Company 123 - Unable - TCAS RA Standby\" The ATC response in both cases should be: \"roger\" This relieves the controller of the responsibility to provide separation and he will not try to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" When TCAS announces \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" the PF must return the aeroplane promptly but smoothly to the ATC clearance. Announce the TCAS \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" message when the conflict is over using the phraseology: \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO (assigned clearance)\", or \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, (assigned clearance) RESUMED\".",

The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 90°, which places it into the parallel entry sector (sector 1 - blue color). How to divide the sectors: Measure an angle of 70 degrees from the inbound track towards the holding ( Expand the 70 degrees line on both sides of the holding. Expand the inbound track as well (the track of 360 degrees for this example). Three sectors should appear. The largest one is the direct entry sector (green), the smallest one is the offset entry sector (purple) and the remaining one is the parallel entry sector (blue). Note: The inbound track is the track towards the holding fix. Parallel entry procedure (left-hand pattern): Entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to the right to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound track). The aircraft should follow the track of 180° for the appropriate timing or DME distance. Turn inbound: When the time has passed or the limiting DME is reached, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 360° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the left to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed.",

These categories provide a standardized basis for relating aircraft manoeuvrability to specific instrument approach procedures. For precision approach procedures, the dimensions of the aircraft are also a factor for the calculation of the obstacle clearance height (OCH). For Category DL aircraft, an additional obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is provided, when necessary, to take into account the specific dimensions of these aircraft. 3.3.1.3 The criterion taken into consideration for the classification of aeroplanes by categories is the indicated airspeed at threshold (Vat), which is equal to the stall speed Vso multiplied by 1.3, or stall speed Vs1g multiplied by 1.23 in the landing configuration at the maximum certificated landing mass.

The transition from the visual (circling) manoeuvre to the missed approach should be initiated by a climbing turn, within the circling area, towards the landing runway, to return to the circling altitude or higher, immediately followed by interception and execution of the missed approach procedure. The indicated airspeed during these manoeuvres shall not exceed the maximum indicated airspeed associated with visual manoeuvring. 6.4.2 The circling manoeuvre may be carried out in more than one direction. For this reason, different patterns are required to establish the aircraft on the prescribed missed approach course depending on its position at the time visual reference is lost.

            "explanation": "SEGMENTS OF INSTRUMENT APPROACH 1. An Arrival Segment is the phase during which the aircraft transits from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles. Given that explanation, we can look at each option individually. \"is within the en-route structure and starting the arrival.\" Incorrect. The aircraft left the en-route structure at the beginning of the arrival, and the IAF is at the end of the arrival, so the arrival is finished by this point also. \"has left the en-route structure.\" Correct. The aircraft left the en-route section at the beginning of the arrival, and is now finished with the arrival (at the IAF). \"has started the final approach.\" Incorrect, the aircraft will not begin the final approach until the FAF (Final Approach Fix). \"is flying at the approach altitude.\" Incorrect. The IAF is often at a different altitude to the final \"platform altitude\" as it is often known (this is what we assume is meant by the approach altitude).",

ICAO Doc 8168 1.8 VERTICAL PATH CONTROL ON NON-PRECISION APPROACH PROCEDURES 1.8.1 Introduction 1.8.1.1 Studies have shown that the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is high on non-precision approaches. While the procedures themselves are not inherently unsafe, the use of the traditional step down descent technique for flying non-precision approaches is prone to error, and is therefore discouraged. Operators should reduce this risk by emphasizing training and standardization in vertical path control on non-precision approach procedures. Operators typically employ one of three techniques for vertical path control on non-precision approaches: a) continuous descent final approach (CDFA); b) constant angle descent; and c) step down approach. Of these techniques, the CDFA technique is preferred. Operators should use the CDFA technique whenever possible as it adds to the safety of the approach operation by reducing pilot workload and by lessening the possibility of error in flying the approach.",

Therefore, there can be no single procedure designed that will cater for conducting a circling approach in every situation. 7.2.2 After initial visual contact, the basic assumption is that the runway environment should be kept in sight while at minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) for circling. The runway environment includes features such as the runway threshold or approach lighting aids or other markings identifiable with the runway.",

Where a steeper descent gradient is necessary, the maximum permissible is 6.5 per cent/3.7° (65 m/km (395 ft/NM)) for Category A and B aircraft, 6.1 per cent/3.5° (61 m/km (370 ft/NM)) for Category C, D and E aircraft, and 10 per cent (5.7°) for Category H.

In the case of a precision approach, the operationally preferred glide path angle is 3.0° as specified in Annex 10, Volume I. An ILS glide path/MLS elevation angle in excess of 3.0° is used only where alternate means available to satisfy obstacle clearance requirements are impractical.

This is achieved through resolution advisories (RAs), which propose manoeuvres, and through traffic advisories (TAs), which are intended to prompt visual acquisition and to act as a warning that an RA may follow. TAs indicate the approximate positions of intruding aircraft that may later cause resolution advisories. RAs propose vertical manoeuvres that are predicted to increase or maintain separation from threatening aircraft. ACAS I equipment is only capable of providing TAs, while ACAS II is capable of providing both TAs and RAs. In this chapter, reference to ACAS means ACAS II",

            "explanation": "In a standard holding pattern, turns are made to the right. There are three types of entry to the holding pattern: direct, parallel, and offset (also known as teardrop) entries. The choice of entry depends on the aircraft's magnetic track to the holding fix. The holding inbound course is 341°. This means that the outbound course is 341° - 180° = 161°. The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 150°, which places it into the offset entry sector (sector 2). Offset entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to follow a magnetic track of 131° which creates an angle of 30° with the inbound course (161° - 30° = 131°). The aircraft is flying at 3 000 ft and should follow the track of 131° for one minute because it is flying below 14 000 ft (For 1 min at or below 14 000 ft, for 1 min 30 sec above 14 000 ft). Turn inbound: When one minute has passed, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 341° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 161° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed. ICAO Doc 8168 - Flight Procedures 1.4 ENTRY Sector 1 procedure (parallel entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned left onto an outbound heading for the appropriate period of time; then b) the aircraft is turned left onto the holding side to intercept the inbound track or to return to the fix; and then c) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 2 procedure (offset entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned onto a heading to make good a track making an angle of 30° from the reciprocal of the inbound track on the holding side; then b) the aircraft will fly outbound: 1) for the appropriate period of time, where timing is specified; or 2) until the appropriate limiting DME distance is reached, where distance is specified. If a limiting radial is also specified, then the outbound distance is determined either by the limiting DME distance or the limiting radial, whichever comes first; c) the aircraft is turned right to intercept the inbound holding track; and d) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 3 procedure (direct entry): Having reached the fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Altimeter setting Procedures. Transition Altitude. The altitude in the vicinity of an airport at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is determined from an altimeter set to QNH. Transition altitude is normally specified for each airfield by the country in which the airfield exists. Transition altitude will not normally be below 3000 ft and must be published on the appropriate charts. Transition Level. The lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude. Transition level is usually passed to the aircraft during the approach or landing clearances. The transition layer may be published, or it may be supplied by ATC via the ATIS or during the arrival. Half flight levels may be used: for example, \"FL45\". Transition between Flight Levels and Altitudes. The vertical position of an aircraft at or below transition altitude shall be expressed in altitude (QNH). Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending. After an approach clearance has been issued and the descent to land is commenced, the vertical positioning of an aircraft above the transition level may be by reference to altitude (QNH) provided that level flight above the transition altitude is not indicated or anticipated. This is intended for turbo jet aircraft where an uninterrupted descent from high altitude is desired and for airfields equipped to reference altitudes throughout the descent. Normally, switching over to QNH will occur at the Transition Level. However, exceptions shall be allowed where the vertical position of the aircraft may be referenced to altitudes, provided that the aircraft is descending, does not level off above the transition altitude and has received an approach clearance.",

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. RA is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and only then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of this system despite possible conflicting ATC instructions. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, nonetheless pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology.",

            "explanation": "The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) or Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) was developed in order to reduce the risk of mid-air collisions between aircraft. It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the ACAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during an ACAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. When there is a collision danger between two aircraft, the ACAS systems of these aircraft will inform the pilots in the form of Resolution Advisory (RA) giving them instructions to follow. The ACAS systems of the two aircraft are communicating with each other in order to provide the pilots with non-contradicting instructions (i.e. one aircraft may instructed to climb and the other to descend). The ATC is usually unaware of the onset of a Resolution Advisory (RA) and the respective instructions given to the pilots. That is the reason why after following the Resolution Advisory (RA), the pilot shall notify the ATC as soon as possible. Note: After the response to an ACAS RA is completed, a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated. (ICAO Doc 4444)",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Different modes of operation are applicable for parallel runways, and they are defined by a mode number that specifies the type of operation being carried out. Mode 1: Independent Parallel Approaches Independent parallel approaches involve simultaneous adjacent approaches to parallel instrument runways. ATS surveillance system separation minima between aircraft using adjacent published instrument approach procedures are not applied on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 1 is labeled as independent and indicates that the operations on one runway are completely unrelated to those on the other. Mode 2: Dependent Parallel Approaches Dependent parallel approaches involve adjacent aircraft making simultaneous instrument approaches to parallel runways, with radar separation applied longitudinally and laterally between the aircraft on the extended runway centre lines. Mode 2 (dependent) functions similarly, but with the inclusion of radar separation, resulting in operations on one runway being reliant on those on the other. Mode 3: Independent Parallel Departures Aircraft depart from the parallel runways at the same time. Mode 4: Segregated Parallel Operations One runway is used for departures while the other is used for approaches.

When reported RVR is less than the RVR minima required for the specific approach procedure, the aircraft cannot continue below 1000 ft above aerodrome elevation or into the final approach segment if DH is higher than 1000 ft. This means that a missed approach must be initiated. Note: The question does not clarify the current altitude of the aircraft. We choose the answer 'immediately go around' as the best option.

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The aircraft is executing an approach to runway 22 followed by a visual manoeuvering (circling) to runway 04. When visual reference is lost, the pilot should initially make a climbing turn towards the landing runway, which is runway 04.

Outside of these conditions, it can be requested for an aircraft to follow published noise abatement procedures, and in this case, that is very likely, due to the time of the day, and the favourable conditions on everything other than wind. Of course, if the aircraft cannot take-off from that runway with a 4kt tailwind for performance reasons, for instance, then it is a different story, but that is not part of the question.

In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation). It is important to note that the OCA/H is not always the same as Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H), but a DA/H will never be lower than the corresponding OCA/H.",

ATC tolerance - This is not a real thing. Ground equipment tolerance - The margin for error in a VOR transmitter, for example. This does affect the tolerance of a fix. Flight technical tolerance - This is the tolerance with which the aircraft is being flown, and is an odd choice for this question, but does also include display errors and innacuracies reading the instruments, which affect fix accuracy and tolerance area.

It serves as a last-resort safety net irrespective of any ATC separation standards. The Resolution Advisory (RA) will communicate with the TCAS system of the other aircraft (where possible) to give the most optimum avoidance manoeuvre. A resolution advisory is issued when the estimated time to the closest point of approach with the conflicting aircraft is 15-34 seconds. Since pilots are expected to react to the RA within 5 seconds, it effectively leaves 10-29 seconds to avoid a possible collision. Therefore, pilots must first initiate the RA manoeuvre and then worry about making the ATC calls. Following a mid-air collision accident, in which one crew ignored the indication of the system, all European operators must clearly instruct their crews to follow the commands of the TCAS system, no matter what clearance ATC may give. It is recognised that workload is often high during a TCAS RA encounter, but nonetheless, pilots shall notify ATC as soon as possible using the standard phraseology. Pilots must NOT request an altitude clearance from ATC before performing the Resolution Advisory Manoeuvre. The manoeuvre should be followed immediately, as TCAS RAs override ATC authority until clear of conflict.",

The tolerance value used by ATC to determine that Mode C derived level information displayed to the controller is accurate, is the reported altitude/level ± 300 ft. Mode C altitude reply increments → 100 ft Mode C altitude reply tolerance → 300 ft from the reported altitude/level",

ICAO Doc 8168 - Flight Procedures Chapter 3 OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURES 3.2 BEGINNING OF DEPARTURE 3.2.1 The departure procedure begins at the departure end of the runway (DER), which is the end of the area declared suitable for take-off (i.e. the end of the runway or clearway as appropriate). 3.2.2 Since the point of lift-off will vary, the departure procedure assumes that a turn at 120 m (394 ft) above the elevation of the aerodrome is not initiated by the pilot sooner than 600 m from the beginning of the runway. 3.2.3 Procedures are normally designed/optimized for turns at a point 600 m from the beginning of the runway. However, in some cases the pilot shall not be allowed to initiate a turn before the DER (or a specified point), and this information will be noted on the departure chart.",

The pilot has the runway lights of aerodrome C in sight. A missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established.

Therefore, there can be no single procedure designed that will cater for conducting a circling approach in every situation. 7.2.2 After initial visual contact, the basic assumption is that the runway environment should be kept in sight while at minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) for circling.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question was created based on incomplete feedback. If you encounter it in your official exam, please inform us. The information provided by ACAS II is intended to assist flight crew in the safe operation of an aeroplane by providing advice on appropriate action to reduce the risk of collision. This is achieved through Resolution Advisories (RAs), which propose manoeuvres, and through Traffic Advisories (TAs), which are intended to prompt visual acquisition and to act as a warning that an RA may follow. Traffic Advisory (TA) means a caution to the flight crew that an aircraft has become a potential collision threat. Resolution Advisory (RA) means a warning to the flight crew of an imminent collision threat, combined with commands for the crew to use in avoiding an airborne collision. When an RA is produced, the pilot flying shall immediately take the corrective action indicated by the RA, even if this conflicts with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) instruction, unless doing so would jeopardise the safety of the aeroplane. In nearly all cases, it's crucial to adhere to ACAS' guidance. There are only a few exceptions when you should not immediately respond to an RA: If you receive a stall warning, further maneuvering could lead to a stall. If there is a windshear warning, use all available aircraft performance to escape the windshear threat. If there is a ground proximity warning, use all available aircraft performance to avoid terrain closure. Note: In this instance, we find that the option \"terrain alert\" is not as applicable since the TCAS RA specifically directs the aircraft to \"CLIMB\".",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

The vertical cross-section of each segment is divided into primary and secondary areas. Full obstacle clearances are applied over the primary areas reducing to zero at the outer edges of the secondary areas ( 1.3.2 On straight segments, the width of the primary area at any given point is equal to one-half of the total width. The width of each secondary area is equal to one-quarter of the total width. 1.3.3 Where no track guidance is provided during a turn specified by the procedure, the total width of the area is considered primary area. 1.3.4 The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) is provided for the whole width of the primary area. In the secondary area, MOC is provided at the inner edges reducing to zero at the outer edges ( We are interested in how the primary and secondary areas are established in this question.

In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation). It is important to note that the OCA/H is not always the same as Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H), but a DA/H will never be lower than the corresponding OCA/H.",

            "explanation": "Note: The wording here might be slightly different than in the exam, the feedback was unclear about it. Please let us know if you see the question and how it was phrased, thank you! Short explanation: The Boeing 777 falls under the C/D category aircraft, with a reference height of 420 ft (plus an additional 50 ft for operational considerations). Precision approach: decision altitude or height (DA/DH): Category C/D aircraft: 420 ft (with 50 ft added for operational reasons). Therefore, the calculation simplifies to: DH = 420 ft + 50 ft = 470 ft Detailed explanation: So one part of this question is asking you to choose from MDH or DH. Decision Height (DH) refers to precision approaches, and is the lowest height above the runway threshold where the pilot must begin a missed approach, if the runway is not yet in sight. So operationally, it is where you decide to continue if visual, or begin the go-around procedure if you are not yet visual. Minimum Descent Height (MDH) refers to non-precision approaches (NPAs), and is a relic of the past, where NPAs could be flown by descending to the MDA/H and flying level until visual with the runway or the missed approach point. So therefore, as we are dealing with a precision approach here, the answer begins with DH. The next job is to work out what the DH of the approach will be for that B777. It is a very large aircraft and accompanies approach categories C/D (two categories because its circling speed puts it in a different category to the VAT speed). The approach category of an aircraft depends on its VAT speed (speed over the threshold) at MLM (maximum landing mass), or circling minima, which can give it two categories, as mentioned above. Having categories for this means that different approach speeds can be taken into account for obstacle clearance, circle to land and go-around manoeuvres. As the B777 category is C/D, we can use 420 ft, plus the 50 ft addition (it is very common to add a small amount like this, for different corrections and safety margin, decided by the operator). Therefore our answer is DH = 470 ft.",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Let's see each choice individually: The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating. This choice is correct. If the approach is executed with a higher speed, it may be difficult for the aircraft to decelerate after touchdown and come to stop within the available runway length. The aircraft may struggle to touch down precisely at the desired point, leading to an extended touchdown point and requiring additional runway to come to a stop. You may land before the threshold to get more braking distance. Braking distance becomes critical when approaching a short runway. Landing before the threshold is not allowed and not considered an option, so this choice is wrong. Nothing, you can make it This choice could be correct as well, but we choose the option \"The aircraft may exceed the runway because high speed can make the plane floating.\" Please provide further feedback if available. The aircraft will automatically adjust its landing speed to match the shorter runway length. The landing speed of an aircraft is determined by factors such as aircraft type, weight, approach configuration, and wind conditions. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the aircraft is operated within safe landing parameters, regardless of the length of the runway. Simply landing on a shorter runway does not trigger an automatic adjustment of the aircraft's landing speed.",

The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles.",

Note 2.— Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic causing an RA. Visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at night. When a RA occurs, the Flight Crew must notify the appropriate ATC unit as soon as possible, as permitted by Flight Crew workload, in the following manner: \"Company 123, TCAS RA standby\" If the pilot is unable to comply with an ATC clearance or instruction because there is a RA, the appropriate response is: \"Company 123 - Unable - TCAS RA Standby\" The ATC response in both cases should be: \"roger\" This relieves the controller of the responsibility to provide separation and he will not try to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" When TCAS announces \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" the PF must return the aeroplane promptly but smoothly to the ATC clearance. Announce the TCAS \"CLEAR OF CONFLICT\" message when the conflict is over using the phraseology: \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO (assigned clearance)\", or \"Company 123, CLEAR OF CONFLICT, (assigned clearance) RESUMED\".",

The choice of entry depends on the aircraft's magnetic track to the holding fix. The holding inbound course is 360°. This means that the outbound course is 360° - 180° = 180°. The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 90°, which places it into the parallel entry sector (sector 1 - blue color). How to divide the sectors: Measure an angle of 70 degrees from the inbound track towards the holding ( Expand the 70 degrees line on both sides of the holding. Expand the inbound track as well (the track of 360 degrees for this example). Three sectors should appear. The largest one is the direct entry sector (green), the smallest one is the offset entry sector (purple) and the remaining one is the parallel entry sector (blue). Note: The inbound track is the track towards the holding fix. Parallel entry procedure (left-hand pattern): Entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to the right to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound track). The aircraft should follow the track of 180° for the appropriate timing or DME distance. Turn inbound: When the time has passed or the limiting DME is reached, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 360° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the left to follow a magnetic track of 180° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed.",

These categories provide a standardized basis for relating aircraft manoeuvrability to specific instrument approach procedures. For precision approach procedures, the dimensions of the aircraft are also a factor for the calculation of the obstacle clearance height (OCH). For Category DL aircraft, an additional obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is provided, when necessary, to take into account the specific dimensions of these aircraft. 3.3.1.3 The criterion taken into consideration for the classification of aeroplanes by categories is the indicated airspeed at threshold (Vat), which is equal to the stall speed Vso multiplied by 1.3, or stall speed Vs1g multiplied by 1.23 in the landing configuration at the maximum certificated landing mass.

The transition from the visual (circling) manoeuvre to the missed approach should be initiated by a climbing turn, within the circling area, towards the landing runway, to return to the circling altitude or higher, immediately followed by interception and execution of the missed approach procedure. The indicated airspeed during these manoeuvres shall not exceed the maximum indicated airspeed associated with visual manoeuvring. 6.4.2 The circling manoeuvre may be carried out in more than one direction. For this reason, different patterns are required to establish the aircraft on the prescribed missed approach course depending on its position at the time visual reference is lost.

            "explanation": "SEGMENTS OF INSTRUMENT APPROACH 1. An Arrival Segment is the phase during which the aircraft transits from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The arrival segment starts at the last en-route point and ends at the initial approach fix (IAF). When a Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) is used, it will provide transition from the en-route phase to the approach phase. The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) marks the end point of the STAR. 2. The next phase of an approach procedure is the Initial Approach Segment. The initial approach segment is the segment of an instrument approach procedure executed between the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF). During this segment, aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and the descent required. 3. During the next phase, the Intermediate Approach Segment, the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. It begins at the IF and ends at the FAF or FAP, as applicable. The obstacle clearance requirement reduces to 150 m (492 ft) from 300 m (984 ft) in the primary area. 4. The Final Approach Segment is the phase during which alignment and descent for landing are made. In the case of a precision approach, the final approach segment will begin at the final approach point (FAP) rather than a fix (FAF for non precision approaches). The FAP is a point on the final approach track where the intermediate approach altitude/height intercepts the nominal glide path. 5. The last phase of the approach procedure is the Missed Approach Segment. The purpose of the missed approach segment is to protect the aircraft from obstacles. Given that explanation, we can look at each option individually. \"is within the en-route structure and starting the arrival.\" Incorrect. The aircraft left the en-route structure at the beginning of the arrival, and the IAF is at the end of the arrival, so the arrival is finished by this point also. \"has left the en-route structure.\" Correct. The aircraft left the en-route section at the beginning of the arrival, and is now finished with the arrival (at the IAF). \"has started the final approach.\" Incorrect, the aircraft will not begin the final approach until the FAF (Final Approach Fix). \"is flying at the approach altitude.\" Incorrect. The IAF is often at a different altitude to the final \"platform altitude\" as it is often known (this is what we assume is meant by the approach altitude).",

ICAO Doc 8168 1.8 VERTICAL PATH CONTROL ON NON-PRECISION APPROACH PROCEDURES 1.8.1 Introduction 1.8.1.1 Studies have shown that the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is high on non-precision approaches. While the procedures themselves are not inherently unsafe, the use of the traditional step down descent technique for flying non-precision approaches is prone to error, and is therefore discouraged. Operators should reduce this risk by emphasizing training and standardization in vertical path control on non-precision approach procedures. Operators typically employ one of three techniques for vertical path control on non-precision approaches: a) continuous descent final approach (CDFA); b) constant angle descent; and c) step down approach. Of these techniques, the CDFA technique is preferred. Operators should use the CDFA technique whenever possible as it adds to the safety of the approach operation by reducing pilot workload and by lessening the possibility of error in flying the approach.",

Where a steeper descent gradient is necessary, the maximum permissible is 6.5 per cent/3.7° (65 m/km (395 ft/NM)) for Category A and B aircraft, 6.1 per cent/3.5° (61 m/km (370 ft/NM)) for Category C, D and E aircraft, and 10 per cent (5.7°) for Category H.

In the case of a precision approach, the operationally preferred glide path angle is 3.0° as specified in Annex 10, Volume I. An ILS glide path/MLS elevation angle in excess of 3.0° is used only where alternate means available to satisfy obstacle clearance requirements are impractical.

ICAO Doc 8168 2.4 OBSTACLE CLEARANCE 2.4.1 Holding area The holding area includes the basic holding area and the entry area. The basic holding area is the airspace required for a holding pattern at a specific level, based on the allowances for aircraft speed, wind effect, timing errors, holding fix characteristics, etc. The entry area is the airspace required for the entry procedure. 2.4.2 Buffer area 2.4.2.1 An additional buffer area extends 9.3 km (5.0 NM) beyond the boundary of the holding area. Significant obstacles in the buffer area are taken into consideration when determining the minimum holding level. 2.4.2.2 For helicopter holding procedures, the buffer area is 3.7 km (2 NM) wide and only applies below 1830 m (6000 ft).",

            "explanation": "In a standard holding pattern, turns are made to the right. There are three types of entry to the holding pattern: direct, parallel, and offset (also known as teardrop) entries. The choice of entry depends on the aircraft's magnetic track to the holding fix. The holding inbound course is 341°. This means that the outbound course is 341° - 180° = 161°. The aircraft approaches the holding fix with a magnetic track of 150°, which places it into the offset entry sector (sector 2). Offset entry: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix, it should alter its heading to follow a magnetic track of 131° which creates an angle of 30° with the inbound course (161° - 30° = 131°). The aircraft is flying at 3 000 ft and should follow the track of 131° for one minute because it is flying below 14 000 ft (For 1 min at or below 14 000 ft, for 1 min 30 sec above 14 000 ft). Turn inbound: When one minute has passed, the aircraft should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 341° (inbound course) until it reaches the holding fix again. Turn outbound: When the aircraft reaches the holding fix for the second time, it should turn to the right to follow a magnetic track of 161° (outbound course). Repeat the holding: The aircraft should repeat the holding pattern until it is cleared to proceed. ICAO Doc 8168 - Flight Procedures 1.4 ENTRY Sector 1 procedure (parallel entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned left onto an outbound heading for the appropriate period of time; then b) the aircraft is turned left onto the holding side to intercept the inbound track or to return to the fix; and then c) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 2 procedure (offset entry): a) at the fix, the aircraft is turned onto a heading to make good a track making an angle of 30° from the reciprocal of the inbound track on the holding side; then b) the aircraft will fly outbound: 1) for the appropriate period of time, where timing is specified; or 2) until the appropriate limiting DME distance is reached, where distance is specified. If a limiting radial is also specified, then the outbound distance is determined either by the limiting DME distance or the limiting radial, whichever comes first; c) the aircraft is turned right to intercept the inbound holding track; and d) on second arrival over the holding fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern. Sector 3 procedure (direct entry): Having reached the fix, the aircraft is turned right to follow the holding pattern.",

These categories provide a standardized basis for relating aircraft manoeuvrability to specific instrument approach procedures. For precision approach procedures, the dimensions of the aircraft are also a factor for the calculation of the obstacle clearance height (OCH). For Category DL aircraft, an additional obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is provided, when necessary, to take into account the specific dimensions of these aircraft (see Part II, Section 1, Chapter 1, 1.3).",

            "explanation": "ICAO Altimeter setting Procedures. Transition Altitude. The altitude in the vicinity of an airport at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is determined from an altimeter set to QNH. Transition altitude is normally specified for each airfield by the country in which the airfield exists. Transition altitude will not normally be below 3000 ft and must be published on the appropriate charts. Transition Level. The lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude. Transition level is usually passed to the aircraft during the approach or landing clearances. The transition layer may be published, or it may be supplied by ATC via the ATIS or during the arrival. Half flight levels may be used: for example, \"FL45\". Transition between Flight Levels and Altitudes. The vertical position of an aircraft at or below transition altitude shall be expressed in altitude (QNH). Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending. After an approach clearance has been issued and the descent to land is commenced, the vertical positioning of an aircraft above the transition level may be by reference to altitude (QNH) provided that level flight above the transition altitude is not indicated or anticipated. This is intended for turbo jet aircraft where an uninterrupted descent from high altitude is desired and for airfields equipped to reference altitudes throughout the descent. Normally, switching over to QNH will occur at the Transition Level. However, exceptions shall be allowed where the vertical position of the aircraft may be referenced to altitudes, provided that the aircraft is descending, does not level off above the transition altitude and has received an approach clearance.",
