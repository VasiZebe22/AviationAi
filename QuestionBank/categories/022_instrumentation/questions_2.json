Instead, it is often paired to an Air Data Computer (ADC), a combination called an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU). Therefore, the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) consists of the Air Data Reference (ADR) system combined with an Inertial Reference (IR) system. The ADR part of the ADIRU outputs the following data: altitude, airspeed, Mach number, angle of attack, temperature, and overspeed warnings. The IR part of the ADIRU supplies the attitude, flight path vector, track, heading, accelerations, angular rates, ground speed, and aircraft position. As we have seen above, each ADIRU is divided in two parts, either of which can work separately in case of failure in the other. Failure of the ADR does not affect the IRU. Therefore, \"Attitude and heading data may still be used\". Note: it seems that the examiner has decided to ignore the fact that normally, there are three ADIRUs and with this amount of redundancy, a single barometric feed failure is unlikely to lead to a loss of indications, this is what you'd expect in a modern aircraft.",

            "explanation": "PRINCIPLE OF THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR (ASI) When an aeroplane is stationary on the ground it is subject to normal atmospheric or static pressure, which acts equally on all parts of the aeroplane structure. In flight, the aeroplane experiences an additional pressure due to the aeroplane's motion through the air, which is known as dynamic pressure, and is dependent upon the forward motion of the aeroplane and the density of the air. The airspeed indicator thus measures the pressure differential between the two sources, and provides a display indication graduated in units of speed. BLOCKAGES - PITOT TUBE (figure 1) A blockage of the pitot tube, possibly due to ice, causes the ASI to not respond to changes of speed in level flight. The capsule behaves as a barometer or altimeter capsule, and reacts to changes in the static pressure. If the aeroplane climbs, the ASI indicates an increase in airspeed (over-read) and if it descends, it indicates a decrease in airspeed (under-read). BLOCKAGES - PITOT TUBE (figure 2) A blocked static source during descent will mean that the ‘old’ (higher altitude) static pressure surrounding the capsule will be lower than it should be, so that if the pitot supply is normal the ASI will over-read. A climb with blocked static source and normal pitot air will result in the ASI under-reading. With a blocked static source, the ASI over-reads in a descent. A useful mnemonic for examinations is PUDSOD, which stands for: ‘Pitot Blocked: – Under-reads in Descent Static Blocked: – Over-reads in Descent’ The opposite of this can also be concluded: ‘Pitot Blocked: – Over-reads in Climb Static Blocked: – Under-reads in Climb’",

Airspeed Unreliable indications can result due to erroneous data from the pitot/static system, AoA vanes, ADIRU, or damage to the radome. Blockages or freezing in the pitot/static system can result in airspeed and altitude indications that are unreliable. This could mean increasing indicated airspeed in a climb, decreasing indicated airspeed in descent, or unpredictable indicated in cruise. If abnormal airspeed indications are recognized, immediately set the target pitch attitude and thrust setting for the airplane and configuration. To determine if a reliable source of indicated airspeed is available, the flight crew should assess and compare flight deck indications. Possible erroneous flight deck indications that can assist the flight crew to determine a reliable airspeed indication are: Stick shaker activation on one side. Airspeed low indications on one side.

            "explanation": "A Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) is a sensitive differential pressure gauge, which records the rate of change of atmospheric pressure in terms of rate of climb or descent, when an aeroplane departs from level flight. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION The principle employed is that of measuring the difference in pressure between two chambers, one of which is enclosed within the other. The pressure of the atmosphere is communicated directly to the inner chamber (capsule) and through a calibrated choke or capsule case to the outer chamber. If the pressure changes, as in a climb or descent, the lag between the capsule and outer chamber results in a pressure differential across the metering unit, which is a direct measure of the aeroplane's rate of climb or descent. ERRORS OF THE VSI The VSI can suffer from the following errors: LAG When an aeroplane suddenly climbs or descends, a delay of a few seconds occurs before the pointer settles at the appropriate rate of climb or descent, which is due to the time required for the pressure differential to develop. POSITION (OR PRESSURE) ERROR If the static pressure is subject to position error the VSI will wrongly indicate a climb or descent when speed is suddenly changed; this is most noticeable during take-off acceleration. INSTRUMENT ERROR This error is due to the manufacturer’s tolerances. MANOEUVRE INDUCED ERROR Errors induced by manoeuvres or flight in turbulence can cause any pressure instrument to misread for up to 3 seconds at low altitudes and up to 10 seconds at high altitudes. BLOCKAGES A blockage in the static line renders the instrument unserviceable, and the pointer registers zero regardless of the aeroplane's vertical speed. BREAKAGE OR LEAKAGE IN THE STATIC LINE A breakage or leakage in the static pressure supply line causes the static value to change as the breakage occurs. Note: Barometric error occurs when the actual datum level pressure differs from that to which the subscale is set. It is caused by the changing ambient barometric pressure experienced during transit and with the passage of time. Temperature does not directly effect the VSI and total pressure is not used by this instrument.",

Vertical speed indicators are supplied with static pressure from the static ports. A blockage of the static port makes it impossible for pressure changes to enter the static line and traps the pressure that existed at the moment when the blockage occurred. In aircraft that are not pressurised, an alternate static source is usually provided in case the static port becomes blocked. Static pressure in the cabin is slightly lower than the actual static pressure around the aircraft due to suction effects resulting from the airflow around the cabin. When a static supply is changed from outside static ports to the alternate static source, the VSI briefly indicates a climb as the pressure within the capsule decreases slightly. Once the pressure has equalised through the capillary, VSI indications are accurate.",

            "explanation": "THE SENSITIVE ALTIMETER (figure 1) The sensitive altimeter employs a minimum of two aneroid capsules. This provides for a more accurate measurement of pressure and provides more power to drive the mechanical linkage. The movement of the capsules in response to changes in altitude (pressure) is transmitted via a suitable mechanical linkage to three pointers that display (against a graduated instrument scale) the aeroplane altitude in tens, hundreds, and thousands of feet. The whole assembly is encased in a container, which is fed with static pressure, but is otherwise completely airtight. SERVO ALTIMETERS (figure 2) Servo-assisted altimeters use the same basic principles as sensitive altimeters, whereby pressure changes are measured using the expansion and contraction of evacuated capsules. The instrument uses an electrical servomotor to transmit the movement of conventional aneroid capsules to the instrument display. A digital counter system and a single pointer indicate the altitude. SERVO-ALTIMETER POWER FAILURE In the event of power failure, the servo-altimeter does not function, and warning flags immediately display on the dial, indicating that the AC power supply failed. A standard sensitive altimeter is required as a standby instrument. Servo-altimeters have the following advantages over simple and sensitive altimeters: - At high altitude, very little pressure change takes place for a given change of altitude, with the result that capsule movement is considerably less than for the same change of altitude at lower levels. This factor reduces the efficiency of ordinary altimeters at high levels, whereas the servomechanism picks up a capsule movement as small as 0.0002 in per thousand ft. - Power transmission gives greater accuracy. - There is practically no time lag between the arrival of a new pressure in the instrument, and the positioning of the counters. - Because it is an electrical system, it is possible to correct for pressure error, and incorporate an altitude-alerting device in the system. - Although conventional altimeters now employ digital presentation, it is generally more common with servo-altimeters. The digital presentation reduces the possibility of misreading. - A pointer is still available on the servo-altimeter for use at low level in assessing the rate of change of altitude.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole.

You’re currently maintaining a compass heading of 242°, therefore you look for this value in the lower line of the deviation table. The value above 242°, in the ‘to fly’ line is 240°. This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted. Therefore, the deviation is West.",

For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card.

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

Initially, the pendulous magnet inside your compass will still remain aligned with the magnetic North of the Earth. However, as you increase the bank angle even more, the dip, which is the angle between the horizontal plane and your magnet, will get increasingly higher. At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator.

The earth's magnetic field has two components or forces: a horizontal force parallel to the earth's surface that is used to align the compass with magnetic north and therefore to determine direction and a vertical force that causes the needle to dip down. At the magnetic equator, the horizontal force is dominant, and therefore, there is no dip and the compass is accurate. However, as you move closer to either of the magnetic poles, the vertical component increases, and this induces the magnetic bar in the compass to dip down to align itself vertically with the magnetic field. Lines joining points of equal dip are called isoclinic lines, or magnetic latitudes. There is a magnetic latitude roughly near the equator where the dip is zero (referred to as aclinic line).",

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…). The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles.

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

            "explanation": "When accelerating in level flight, you would expect the artificial horizon (AH) to show wings level and a steady nose attitude. However, due to its construction, both the electrical and air driven AH will show a false attitude. This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems. The electrical AH will show a false climb. The air driven AH will show a false climb and a right turn. This question appears to be asking about an air driven version. The air-driven artificial horizon gives the pilot the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon and is part of the essential set of instruments in any aircraft. It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement. Note: Both AH show a false nose up when accelerating, as seen in many other questions. The 2021 Learning Objectives focus more on the effect of acceleration, rather than the cause. That said, the electrical AH uses mercury switches to maintain the gyro axis vertical. In normal operation, the mercury sits at the bottom of the switch and the circuit is open. During an acceleration, the mercury is pushed out of position and closes the switch, ultimately driving the gyro to show a false climb. An air driven AH uses a pendulous unit and vanes to maintain the gyro axis vertical. During an acceleration, the force acts to disturb both the pendulous unit and the vanes, and this results in a false right climb indication.",

Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft.

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

In this mode, the directional gyro is connected to the magnetic flux detector, which provides a stable magnetic reference to counteract the gyro's apparent drift. \"FREE\" mode (Directional gyro): used when magnetic heading references are not reliable, such as in polar regions. In this mode, the system supplies an inertial heading reference, and the pilot manually introduces corrections to compensate for earth rate and other errors. If the switch is changed to \"FREE\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

A DGI uses a two degrees of freedom gyro with a horizontally mounted axis, while the artificial horizon uses an Earth tied gyro with a vertical axis and 2 degrees of freedom. The rate of turn indicator consists of a rate gyro with its spin axis mounted along the lateral axis of the aircraft. It has only one gimbal, providing the turn indicator’s rate gyro only one degree of freedom. This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument. A reverse gearing system transmits the movement of the gimbal to a pointer which indicates the rate of turn over a rate of turn calibrated scale. The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system. Here are the main properties of the gyroscopic instruments you need to know: Instrument Degrees of freedom Spin axis Directional gyro 2 horizontal Artificial horizon 2 vertical Rate of turn indicator 1 horizontal",

It is caused by the inertia of the spinning mass. The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis. Gyros are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. Despite the property of rigidity, the orientation of a gyro axis may alter over time. Any departure of a gyro axis from its original orientation is called wander. Wander may be either real or apparent (the difference is explained below) or a combination of both. Wander is subdivided into drift and topple. If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. (figure 1) If the gyro axis wanders in the vertical plane, it is called topple, either real or apparent.

If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

Gravity erection is essential for the operation of an artificial horizon. However, accelerations occur during flight which cannot be distinguished from gravitational accelerations, induce indication errors. The erection system therefore tries to align the gyro axis with the apparent vertical. During acceleration, the erection system is unable to distinguish between acceleration caused by gravity (in the direction of the local vertical) and the inertia of its sensor. As a result, the apparent vertical is inclined to the rear (spin axis is displaced from the vertical) and causes a higher pitch indication. In simple words, the horizon bar moves down, indicating a climb. Deceleration causes the apparent vertical to tilt forwards, reducing the perceived pitch attitude.",

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes. Additionally, some more sophisticated artificial horizons are electrically driven and maintain the rotor’s axis vertical by using two mercury level switches and two torque motors.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This implies that the angle of bank should be correct for the TAS and rate of turn. The slip indicator gives a direct indication of the state of balance of the turn. This comprises a solid ball in a curved tube containing liquid with damps out the unwanted oscillations. The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube acting as the effective point of suspension. Operating Principles Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W (figure 1). The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of curvature of the tube. If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines etched on the tube. Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left (figure 2). The aircraft with lift L equal and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being proportional to TAS and rate of turn. The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal force C.",

If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. APPARENT WANDER In this type of wander, the gyro spin axis does not physically wander away from its pre-set direction, but to an observer it appears to have changed its direction. This is because the gyro maintains its direction with respect to a fixed point in space, whereas the observer rotates with the Earth, thus with the passage of time the gyro appears to have changed direction, with reference to an Earth datum. Apparent wander, is also made up of horizontal components called drift, and vertical components called topple. The rate of drift and topple depends upon the latitude and can vary from zero to a maximum of 15.04° per hour (the rate at which the Earth rotates).",

If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. REAL WANDER In real wander, the axis of the gyro moves with respect to inertial space. This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

Here is a rough rule of thumb to calculate the bank angle required for a rate one turn: Bank angle = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, for example, during a take-off run, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement.",

The rate of turn is determined by how quickly an aircraft changes direction. A greater bank angle corresponds to a higher rate of turn. TAS exhibits an inverse relationship with the rate of turn, but it is directly proportional to the radius of the turn due to the increase in inertia and momentum of the aircraft with an increase in TAS. You can quickly compute the necessary bank angle for a standard 3° per second turn using the formula: Angle of bank = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7 For instance, for TAS values of 100 knots and 150 knots: Angle of bank for 100 knots = (100 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 17° Angle of bank for 150 knots = (150 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 22° This comparison reveals that as speed increases, so does the required bank angle to maintain the standard rate of turn, indicating a proportional relationship with TAS.",

The simplest form of gyroscope (or gyro) consists of a rapidly spinning disc (called a rotor). The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis. Gyros have its mass evenly distributed around its spin axis and are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. In order for a gyro to be able to maintain a fixed direction, it must be attached to the airframe in such a way that the aircraft has freedom to manoeuvre without disturbing the orientation of the gyro. This is achieved by using suspension devices which allow this freedom. These are called gimbals. Gyros may have one or two gimbals.",

The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous vanes at the base of the rotor housing, so that when the rotor axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane. Because the four jets are of equal strength but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - the gyro rotor remaining vertical. The opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as two pairs. The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted airflow, while the opposite slot is completely obstructed by its vane. The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. ACCELERATION ERROR (figure 2) The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose- up, right wing down, or climbing right hand turn indication will result. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot. This results in a reaction which acts to port. By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction of application of the Reaction had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise). The gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the pilot. This movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication. Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during acceleration. This force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical. This rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing down indication.",

Gyroscope - A gyroscope provides an AHRS with a measurement of the aircraft's angular rate. Each angular rate is integrated to determine the aircraft's attitude. Accelerometer - An accelerometer supplies an AHRS with a measure of the aircraft's acceleration and is assumed to be measuring gravity alone. This assumption allows the accelerometer to calculate the pitch and roll angles from the direction of the gravity vector. Magnetometer - Since the accelerometer can only measure pitch & roll, a magnetometer provides an AHRS with a measurement of yaw by comparing the measurement of the magnetic field surrounding the aircraft to Earth's magnetic field, just like a traditional magnetic compass.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "Step 1: Find the direction of the turn – clockwise or anticlockwise? The aircraft turns to the left onto a northerly heading => anticlockwise. Step 2: Use the acronym ‘UNOS’ to find if you will overshoot or undershoot? UN – Undershoot = apparent turn to the North. OS – Overshoot = apparent turn to the South. By banking in an anticlockwise direction to 000° (northerly heading), you will need to undershoot by a certain amount if you want to stop your turn exactly at 000°. Step 3: Find the angle by which you will need to overshoot/undershoot by using the following formula (Refer to diagram 1): (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 Remember that the turning error is greatest on a Northerly/Southerly heading. Therefore any time you turn through the North or South the error will be the highest, and any time you turn through West or East the error will be the smallest. Consequently, when your heading is between North and East or South and East, etc. (half-way between two cardinal points) the turning error will be only half as big or twice as big as at these headings. Only in this case, you will use the following formula (Refer to diagram 2) : (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 4 In this question, the aircraft turns to the left onto heading 000°, so it’s turning from an easterly heading (no error) onto a northerly heading (biggest error). As we are not turning on a heading that is midway between two cardinal points, there is no need to apply the second formula. Therefore, you will need to overshoot the heading by: (Bank angle + Lat) ÷ 2 = (10 + 50) ÷ 2 = 30° Step 4: Add/subtract the angle found in step 3 to find the angle at which you should stop the turn so that the compass indicated the desired heading: The desired heading is 000°, and in order to stop the turn at 000°, you need to undershoot this heading by 30°:000 + 30 = 030° Note: We are adding here because undershooting 000° means stopping the turn before passing this value on your compass. Since you turn anticlockwise, the heading values decrease, so you need to add the angle found in step 3 to find the correct undershooting angle.",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve (=flux detection unit) senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you’re on an easterly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The Earths magnetic field can be resolved into two components; horizontal (H) and vertical (Z). It can be seen from the figure that the lines of magnetism are not horizontal as they move away from the equator, the angle between the field line and the local horizontal is called dip. Dip increases as you get closer to the magnetic poles because the H component gets weaker and the Z component gets stronger. At the magnetic poles dip is 90° due to the lack of any H component. A freely suspended compass needle works by detecting the horizontal field component so is very accurate at the Equator where H is maximum. As you approach the magnetic poles, the horizontal component becomes so weak that the DRC will attempt to align with the vertical component Z of the Earth's magnetic field. Theoretically a compass needle would point vertically downwards at the magnetic pole but the compass assembly in a DRC is mounted inside a casing. Eventually an angle of dip will be reached where the rotating compass assembly is unable to move as it makes contact with the case, rendering it unuseable. Note: It's true to say that the variation at the magnetic north pole is very high (up to 180°), but that's not what renders the DRC inoperative.",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334° - 214° = 120° at 3°/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3° = 40 seconds",

This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate.

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviationremains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading: M = C - D(W) or M = C + D(E) From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: T = M - V(W) or T = M + V(E) Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 214° 006°E 220° 008°W 212°",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the North - the airplane will turn clockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned anticlockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the North.",

The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized.

The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. In the northern hemisphere, when accelerating on a westerly heading, the magnet will rotate anticlockwise and indicate an apparent turn to the North. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South.",

This is also often known as a flux valve or a flux detector. - Heading Indicator. - Precession Amplifier. - Precession Motor. - Horizontal Gyro. The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft. If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right heading. If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading. When it operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. The dip angle will have a value of almost 90° at the poles (increased vertical magnetic field) and will be almost null at the equator (low vertical component – high horizontal component). As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever.",

These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole. The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical component of the magnetic field lines of the Earth is called the dip angle. As a consequence, the pendulous magnet will also increasingly tilt towards its vertical and produce greater instrument errors (turning, acceleration…).",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000° M or 360° M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North.

Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

This means that while maintaining a compass indication of 242°, you are flying in reality on a magnetic heading of 240°. Our acronym becomes now as follows: 242° - D – 240° - 22°E - T You don’t really need to find the deviation because you already have the magnetic heading and the variation. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily find the true heading of the aircraft. Moving from the left to the right of the acronym, you need to add if the variation is East (CADET = AD (add) E (east)). In our case, the variation is East, therefore you need to add the 22°E variation to the magnetic heading to obtain a True heading of 262°. It is not needed, nor asked in this question to find the deviation. But you can do it anyway to exercise the two acronyms and get better at solving this type of question. Thanks to the acronym CADET you can easily deduce that the variation is 2°W. In fact, in the direction from C (compass) to T (true) you need to add the deviation whenever it is E (east). In our case we initially have a value of 242° and moving to the right of the acronym (towards T=true), you obtain a value of 240° magnetic heading - the difference hasn’t been added but subtracted.

A compass is marked in degrees from 000 to 359 in a clockwise direction starting from North. Therefore, regardless of your heading, any turn to the left will result in a decrease in your heading in degrees. For example if your heading is 180 degrees and you start turning left your heading indication will decrease through 170, 160, 150 etc. Therefore, it is normal for a left turn to show a decreasing heading value on the DRMC. The DRMC, although simple and prone to errors, is fitted to all aircraft and commonly used as a standby instrument. It’s therefore very important that its indications are checked before you get airborne. The best way to do this is to check its indications with a known value such as the runway heading or another navigation system. The question states that the DRMC indicates 20 degrees differently from the runway heading. Easy Access Rules for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25) states that the DRMC is allowed a maximum error of 10 degrees in normal level flight! Therefore, even allowing for the fact that RW27 could have a magnetic Hdg of 275, the DRMC is unserviceable",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading. From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 004° 001°W 003° 5°W 358°",

This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate.

            "explanation": "The compass is subject to acceleration/deceleration and turning errors. Therefore, you can only have a precise indication in straight and level flight. The magnet inside the compass is a pendulous system and is attached to the aircraft at the pivot point. When the aircraft accelerates on a westerly/easterly heading, the magnet will lag behind due to its inertia as the acceleration will act on the magnet’s center of gravity. Therefore, it will momentarily indicate a turn and the heading indication will erroneously change. There will be no error when accelerating/decelerating in a southerly/northerly direction as this will take place in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic flux lines. An easy way to remember the acceleration errors is by using the acronym ‘ANDS’: AN – Accelerate = apparent turn to the North. DS – Decelerate = apparent turn to the South. In order to visualize in which direction is the compass card turning, try to imagine a simple turn without considering the acceleration error. The magnet inside the compass case is always ‘North seeking’, so it will always remain in a steady position. The compass heading indications will change because the airplane is turning around the compass card and not the opposite. If you are on a westerly heading, and you turn to the South - the airplane will turn anticlockwise around the compass card. As a consequence, the opposite is true => we can say that the compass card has turned clockwise as the airplane made a turn towards the South.",

Initially, the pendulous magnet inside your compass will still remain aligned with the magnetic North of the Earth. However, as you increase the bank angle even more, the dip, which is the angle between the horizontal plane and your magnet, will get increasingly higher. At some point, when the bank angle gets too big, the compass will just ‘fall’ and rotate 180° towards the lowest wing which is into the turn, and the compass will indicate West instead of East. Therefore, the total error of the compass would be 180° on an easterly heading in a steep right turn. Conclusion: beyond the critical bank angle (90 minus the dip angle), the compass will lag by 180 degrees when the aircraft is banked towards the equator.

Because of this, the Earth’s magnetic field consists of magnetic field lines flowing from one pole to another. These lines have some properties that are very important to understand as they greatly affect our navigation on Earth and thus, our navigation instruments such as the magnetic compass. In fact, these magnetic lines are not straight lines spread equally around the Earth. They are straight and horizontal close to the equator, but the higher the latitude, the more these lines tend to converge towards the Earth’s poles. Therefore, they will become more and more inclined until being fully vertical at the pole.

The magnetic lines converge at the magnetic poles, which is different from the geographic pole (the axis around which the Earth is spinning). Another thing to consider is that the magnetic poles continuously change location. For instance, right now the magnetic North pole is situated approximately in Northern Canada, but it is moving at a rate of about 50km/year towards Siberia. On the other hand, the South magnetic pole is moving at around 15 km/year, the same rate at which the North magnetic pole used to move as well as a few years ago.",

The compass’ needle will align itself with the Earth's horizontal component (H) of the Earth's magnetic field. The compass is ineffective near the poles.

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

This assumption allows the accelerometer to calculate the pitch and roll angles from the direction of the gravity vector.

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required.

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

                "This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems"
            ],
            "explanation": "When accelerating in level flight, you would expect the artificial horizon (AH) to show wings level and a steady nose attitude. However, due to its construction, both the electrical and air driven AH will show a false attitude. This is because the force of acceleration affects their erection systems. The electrical AH will show a false climb. The air driven AH will show a false climb and a right turn. This question appears to be asking about an air driven version. The air-driven artificial horizon gives the pilot the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon and is part of the essential set of instruments in any aircraft. It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement. Note: Both AH show a false nose up when accelerating, as seen in many other questions. The 2021 Learning Objectives focus more on the effect of acceleration, rather than the cause. That said, the electrical AH uses mercury switches to maintain the gyro axis vertical. In normal operation, the mercury sits at the bottom of the switch and the circuit is open. During an acceleration, the mercury is pushed out of position and closes the switch, ultimately driving the gyro to show a false climb. An air driven AH uses a pendulous unit and vanes to maintain the gyro axis vertical. During an acceleration, the force acts to disturb both the pendulous unit and the vanes, and this results in a false right climb indication.",

The instrument consists of a needle that indicates the rate of turn and a ball that indicates the slip or skid of the aircraft. If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The main direction indication of the system comes from a directional gyroscope, which is kept from drifting by tying it to the output of a flux valve unit for magnetic reference. This happens when “slave” is selected on the “free/slave” switch. Alternative Explanation: The Gyro-Magnetic Compass (GMC) system has two operational modes: \"SLAVE\" mode: used when magnetic heading references are reliable. It is the normal magnetically-monitored mode. In this mode, the directional gyro is connected to the magnetic flux detector, which provides a stable magnetic reference to counteract the gyro's apparent drift. \"FREE\" mode (Directional gyro): used when magnetic heading references are not reliable, such as in polar regions. In this mode, the system supplies an inertial heading reference, and the pilot manually introduces corrections to compensate for earth rate and other errors. If the switch is changed to \"FREE\" the magnetic signal from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/stator comparison stops, and the gyro is no longer tied to azimuth, and thus acts as a free gyro (DGI). Note: Please read the question carefully as there are two similar questions in our database. One question pertains to FREE mode, while the other one pertains to SLAVE mode.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

A DGI uses a two degrees of freedom gyro with a horizontally mounted axis, while the artificial horizon uses an Earth tied gyro with a vertical axis and 2 degrees of freedom. The rate of turn indicator consists of a rate gyro with its spin axis mounted along the lateral axis of the aircraft. It has only one gimbal, providing the turn indicator’s rate gyro only one degree of freedom. This freedom is limited by a restraining spring by connecting the gimbal to the outer case of the instrument. A reverse gearing system transmits the movement of the gimbal to a pointer which indicates the rate of turn over a rate of turn calibrated scale. The reverse gearing mechanism is designed so that when the gimbal is tilted to the right, the pointer will indicate a left turn to be consistent with the actual turn of the aircraft. The gimbal is calibrated for a certain range of airspeeds only and is prevented to get damaged at high rate turns by a dampening system. Here are the main properties of the gyroscopic instruments you need to know: Instrument Degrees of freedom Spin axis Directional gyro 2 horizontal Artificial horizon 2 vertical Rate of turn indicator 1 horizontal",

Any rapidly spinning symmetrical rotor exhibits gyroscopic properties: - Precession: When an external force is applied to the spinning rotor via the gimbal assembly, the gyro does not move in the direction of the force, but in a direction perpendicular (90° later) to that of the applied force. - Rigidity: Rigidity is the gyro’s property of maintaining its axis in a fixed direction in space unless subjected to an external force. It is caused by the inertia of the spinning mass. The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis. Gyros are defined in their orientation as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor. Despite the property of rigidity, the orientation of a gyro axis may alter over time. Any departure of a gyro axis from its original orientation is called wander. Wander may be either real or apparent (the difference is explained below) or a combination of both. Wander is subdivided into drift and topple. If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. (figure 1) If the gyro axis wanders in the vertical plane, it is called topple, either real or apparent.

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

The instrument consists of a needle that indicates the rate of turn and a ball that indicates the slip or skid of the aircraft. If the needle is deflected and the ball is centered, this means that the aircraft is yawing, or turning around its vertical axis. Yawing can occur when the pilot uses the rudder to make the aircraft turn, or it can occur due to crosswinds or other factors that affect the aircraft's lateral stability. Drifting, Skidding and slipping are all related to the aircraft's sliding motion, and they are displayed in different ways on the turn and slip indicator. Skidding refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the outside of the turn. This is caused by too much rudder in the direction of the turn. Slipping refers to the condition where the aircraft is turning and the ball is deflected to the inside of the turn. This is caused by either too little rudder in the direction of the turn, or even the use of opposite rudder (adverse yaw). Drifting is the condition where the ball is displaced from the center in a straight and level flight, indicating that the aircraft is not aligned with the wind direction.",

Gravity erection is essential for the operation of an artificial horizon. However, accelerations occur during flight which cannot be distinguished from gravitational accelerations, induce indication errors. The erection system therefore tries to align the gyro axis with the apparent vertical. During acceleration, the erection system is unable to distinguish between acceleration caused by gravity (in the direction of the local vertical) and the inertia of its sensor. As a result, the apparent vertical is inclined to the rear (spin axis is displaced from the vertical) and causes a higher pitch indication. In simple words, the horizon bar moves down, indicating a climb. Deceleration causes the apparent vertical to tilt forwards, reducing the perceived pitch attitude.",

These properties are the basic principle of operation behind many attitude, heading, and inertial reference systems found in aircraft. Consider a gyroscope with its mass rotating about a given axis. If a force is applied on the rotating mass in its plane of rotation, the force will induce a torque about an axis situated 90° to its plane of rotation. Because the gyro’s mass is rotating, this force will be applied at a right angle to the gyroscope’s rotational axis. This is called gyroscopic precession. Rigidity determines how prone is the gyro to process torque on its spin axis as the airframe is displaced. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum. Concentrating the gyroscope’s mass at its periphery will give the instrument more stability which ultimately will improve its rigidity in space.",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes. Additionally, some more sophisticated artificial horizons are electrically driven and maintain the rotor’s axis vertical by using two mercury level switches and two torque motors.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube acting as the effective point of suspension. Operating Principles Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W (figure 1). The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of curvature of the tube. If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines etched on the tube. Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left (figure 2). The aircraft with lift L equal and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being proportional to TAS and rate of turn. The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal force C.",

If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. APPARENT WANDER In this type of wander, the gyro spin axis does not physically wander away from its pre-set direction, but to an observer it appears to have changed its direction. This is because the gyro maintains its direction with respect to a fixed point in space, whereas the observer rotates with the Earth, thus with the passage of time the gyro appears to have changed direction, with reference to an Earth datum. Apparent wander, is also made up of horizontal components called drift, and vertical components called topple. The rate of drift and topple depends upon the latitude and can vary from zero to a maximum of 15.04° per hour (the rate at which the Earth rotates).",

If the gyro axis wanders in the horizontal plane, it is called drift, either real or apparent. REAL WANDER In real wander, the axis of the gyro moves with respect to inertial space. This departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and unbalanced gimbals. Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and manufacturing. Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be justified by the level of accuracy required. As with instrument error, gyros need to be as accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money. Real wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.",

The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, and an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances.",

In a Turn Indicator, when the needle is lined up with a hash mark, the aircraft is performing a \"standard rate turn\". The bank angle required to conduct a turn at a specific rate is directly proportional to True Airspeed (TAS). The approximate bank angle required to accomplish a coordinated rate one turn (3°/second) can be calculated by dividing the TAS (in knots) by 10 and then adding 7. Angle of Bank = (TAS / 10) + 7",

It uses an Earth gyro which rotation axis is maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity. Therefore, the rotating mass of the gyro spins in the horizontal plane giving stable lateral and longitudinal references. To maintain the rotor’s axis vertical in flight, the air driven artificial horizon will exhaust air through four slots, each of them being half covered by a pendulous vane. The four jets of air are equal in strength and will flow out the vanes in different directions when the airplane is in straight and level flight. This will keep the axis vertical and no precession will occur. However, if the rotor moves from its vertical position, one slot will completely obstruct the vane, while the opposite slot will leave the vane fully open. The resulting unbalanced airflow streaming out of the vanes will precess the gyro and return the gyro axis to the vertical. Additionally, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. For instance, when an aircraft accelerates in straight and level flight, or during the take-off run, a false nose-up indication will occur. The pitch error is due to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.",

The indications of the magnetic compass are stabilized by the gyroscope to reduce the effects of acceleration and turning errors. The main components of a gyromagnetic compass are the flux valve, the heading indicator, the slaving amplifier, the synchronizing motor, and the horizontal gyro. The flux valve senses the Earth’s magnetic field which is compared to the position of the drive shaft connecting the horizontal gyro and the heading indicator. Anytime the gyro has drifted, and its position would differ from the flux valve field, an AC error signal is transmitted to the precession amplifier. Before being converted into a DC signal, the AC signal is first amplified, and phase detected. This signal drives the precession motor that will realign the gyro. The new position is compared again, and the synchronization will continue until the heading indicator is synchronized. The flux valve is usually remotely located in the wingtip or the fin of the aircraft to be free of any magnetic disturbances. An easy way to remember the order of the gyromagnetic compass operation is by using the acronym ‘FEAT’: Flux valve => Error detector => Amplifier => Torque motor",

Gyro A – The spin axis is horizontal (pitch axis), and the gyro can move about the roll axis. Since there’s no degree of freedom around the yaw axis, it is a yaw gyro. This is the exact setup of a turn indicator. Gyro B – The spin axis is vertical (yaw axis), and the gyro can move about the pitch axis. Since there’s no degree of freedom around the roll axis, it is a roll gyro. Gyro C – The spin axis also vertical (yaw axis), but the gyro cannot move about the pitch axis, only about the roll axis.

It consists of an Earth gyro with its spin axis maintained vertical by Earth’s gravity, providing both pitch and roll indications. The basic air-driven artificial horizon is made pendulous and is maintained bottom-heavy to reduce erection time at start-up. The pendulous system consists of four pendulous vanes, partially open to leave air to flow outside. When the aircraft is not maneuvering, all four air jets are equal and exist the vanes equally. As soon as any acceleration is sensed, the vanes will be affected and will be erroneously displaced. For instance, when the aircraft is accelerating, for example, during a take-off run, the result is a false pitch up and right-hand turn indication. In fact, since the vanes are hanging to the rotor, the lateral vanes will lag during acceleration and will tilt the vertical axis of the gyro, which is normally supposed always to be aligned with the Earth’s vertical. As a result, the horizon bar, moving in the same way as the outer gimbal, will tend to lower downwards (relative to the pilot’s position) and indicate a pitch up movement.",

TAS exhibits an inverse relationship with the rate of turn, but it is directly proportional to the radius of the turn due to the increase in inertia and momentum of the aircraft with an increase in TAS. You can quickly compute the necessary bank angle for a standard 3° per second turn using the formula: Angle of bank = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7 For instance, for TAS values of 100 knots and 150 knots: Angle of bank for 100 knots = (100 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 17° Angle of bank for 150 knots = (150 knots ÷ 10) + 7 = 22° This comparison reveals that as speed increases, so does the required bank angle to maintain the standard rate of turn, indicating a proportional relationship with TAS.",

In order for a gyro to be able to maintain a fixed direction, it must be attached to the airframe in such a way that the aircraft has freedom to manoeuvre without disturbing the orientation of the gyro.

            "explanation": "AIR DRIVEN ARTIFICIAL HORIZON (figure 1) In a gyroscopic attitude indicator system, the rotor assembly is made very slightly bottom-heavy in order to keep down the time taken for initial erection when the gyro is first started up, but a complex control system is required to maintain the rotor axis vertical in flight. The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous vanes at the base of the rotor housing, so that when the rotor axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane. Because the four jets are of equal strength but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - the gyro rotor remaining vertical. The opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as two pairs. The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted airflow, while the opposite slot is completely obstructed by its vane. The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. ACCELERATION ERROR (figure 2) The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not just that due to gravity. When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose- up, right wing down, or climbing right hand turn indication will result. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot. This results in a reaction which acts to port. By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction of application of the Reaction had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise). The gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the pilot. This movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication. Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during acceleration. This force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical. This rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing down indication.",

INSs can be considered to be stand-alone, whereas IRSs are integrated with the FMS. The wording of these options seems to be almost intentionally difficult to understand. To start, we need to realise that EASA are referring to a stabilised platform INS when they call something an inertial navigation system, as per the above learning objective. These are systems that, once aligned, have a platform that remains level and pointing towards the North, which is controlled by rate-integrating gyros and servo motors to keep the platform in that orientation. By inputting the initial location when the INS is aligned and kept still, the system can then track every acceleration in the North/South and East/West axis to keep a track of speed and therefore distance travelled along those axes. Therefore, there is still a reference for this system, the North direction and which way is up. The platform then endeavours to maintain these references during flight. More modern systems using the same idea are called strapdown IRSs. They are much smaller and cheaper, and are fixed to the aircraft structure, measuring the accelerations and rotations of the aircraft and applying them in a computer model of the Earth to provide an improved version of an INS.",

Position computer The aircraft moves in three dimensions, but the navigation equipment is only interested in acceleration in the horizontal plane. Therefore, the key to the whole INS arrangement is the accelerometers. The INS is a stable platform system, where the accelerometers are kept level on a north aligned platform.

The Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs) are a form of INS but are connected directly to the aircraft (no stable platform). These are much lighter, and less complex to have on board, as they use a set of 3-ring laser gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers to measure all the rotations and accelerations, and then calculate into their various components (North-South, East-West, and Vertical) using modern computer methods. This is called a strapdown system, as it is fixed to the aircraft, and is much more usable with other systems, as it can feed info to the FMS, etc.",

Accelerations in the East/West and North/South directions are measured by the accelerometers and are integrated. Acceleration integrated over time: Once = change in velocity. Twice = change in position. It is also true if we state that integrating velocity once over time gives the change in position. Internally, this is calculated by integrators that are time multiplication devices. Initially, acceleration is supplied to the integrator as a value in ft/sec². Multiplying a value in ft/sec² by another value in sec will give you a result in ft/sec => velocity. Velocity is basically how fast has the aircraft moved in feet per second. Then, this value is sent to another integrator to derive the change in position and determine the current position of the aircraft. In other words, a value in ft/sec is multiplied again by a value in seconds, which will result in a value in feet or NM => distance. The second integration will provide the IRS with the distance traveled, but if the initial position AND speed are known as well, the IRS will output the instantaneous position. Summary table of the integration process of the INS and the required inputs: Integrate with time. How many times? Additional Input(s) Output ACCELERATION Once Initial SPEED Instantaneous SPEED ACCELERATION Once ----- Change in SPEED (velocity) ACCELERATION TWICE Initial POSITION + Initial SPEED Instantaneous POSITION ACCELERATION TWICE ----- POSITION SPEED ONCE ----- DISTANCE traveled",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

When stationary the only output from the accelerometers will be due to gravity. During alignment the platform is driven by torque motors until no acceleration is sensed and is therefore level. Once level the platform has to be 'gyrocompassed' to align it with True North. This is acheived by monitoring the output of the gyros to sense topple caused by Earth rotation, the time taken to do this increases with latitude. For these reasons alignment can only be acheived if the aircraft is stationary. Moving an aircraft during alignment will require the process to start again when stationary and it could take as long as 15 - 20 minutes before alignment is complete. Pilots should always wait until INS alignment is complete before moving the aircraft",

The question is asking how these unbounded errors are affecting the system over time since they are the only cumulative errors. In fact, they increase proportionally with time, which means that the error increases as ‘t’ increases. Bounded errors are usually the following: Initial misalignment may not be conducted 100% correctly (aircraft shaking due to ground equipment positioning, crew activity, etc.) There can always be some errors due to the initial misalignment. Accelerators are mechanical systems consisting of a pendulous mechanism, pickoffs and servos that suffer all from the standard instrument error (manufacturing imperfections). Integrators make errors in the first stage of integration due to the incorrect inputs provided (listed in the points above). Unbounded errors are usually the following: Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. Drift of the gyroscopes of the platform, which are the main source of error.",

The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. This system is composed of a stable platform consisting of high quality gyros and accelerometers and a computer. The purpose of the computer is to integrate the accelerometer outputs with time to give velocity and then integrate velocity with time to give distance travelled. From this is available pitch and roll attitude, true heading, true track, drift, present position in latitude and longitude, ground speed and wind. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. These acceleration measuring devices sense any change in the aircraft’s velocity either as an acceleration or deceleration very accurately. The acceleration signal from the amplifier is sent to an integrator which is a time multiplication device. It starts out with acceleration which is in feet per second squared. In the integrator, it is multiplied by time and the result is a velocity in feet per second. With an input of feet per second, it is then sent through a second integrator, which is multiplied by time, the result is a distance in feet or nautical miles. The computer associated with the inertial system knows the latitude and longitude of the take-off point and calculates that the aircraft has travelled so far in the north and east direction. The computer can then compute the new position of the aircraft and give a digital read-out.",

            "explanation": "An Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides the aeroplane’s velocity and position by continuously measuring and integrating its acceleration. This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes. Input data is also required, such as the: TAS - to calculate the wind speed/direction. Initial position – because actual aircraft position during the flight is calculated based on the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – the platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. GNSS (GPS) Position - in order to bound the INS position error. Other inptus are: Mach Number, Radio height, Number of satellites and Angle of attack. Note: The correct option was selected according to EASA LO 022.05.01.01.02 which states 'State that inertial systems require no external input, except TAS, to determine aircraft attitude and navigational data.'

They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation. -It consists of three RLGs that measure angular rates and three internal accelerometers measuring acceleration on all three aircraft’s body axes (longitudinal, lateral, and normal). The laser gyros allow a microprocessor to maintain a stable platform mathematically, rather than mechanically. - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data.

Instead, the system uses ring laser gyros (RLGs) that are attached to the aircraft structure in a specific orientation, and are therefore referred to as strapped-down. The coordinate system for computations is composed of the 3 aircraft axes. The IRS uses 3 accelerometers and 3 RLGs that are installed at right angles to one another to measure linear accelerations and rotations around the aircraft axes. A high-performance computer creates a virtual stabilised platform that is kept aligned by using information from the gyros. Note that there is no physical platform that is kept aligned/level. In flight, the aircraft moves around the centre of gravity (CG). Placing the IRS unit close to the CG improves the reliability of the readings and reduces the amount of IRS drift experienced. RLGs produce two, constant, high-frequency beams of light that travel over a system of mirrors/through fibreoptics, in opposite directions. When the RLG is at rest, the signal from both beams is identical. When a RLG is rotated about its sensitive axis, both beams are affected by the Doppler effect. One is red shifted, and the other blue shifted. This causes a phase difference which can be interpreted by the computer to map motion. \"The IRS is located a bit away from the aircraft CG and it uses laser gyros to calculate accelerations.\" INCORRECT. The laser gyros do not detect accelerations - accelerometers do that job. Furthermore, as stated above, it is located close to the CG of the aircraft. \"It consists of gyros and accelerometers. The gyros keep the platform level and the accelerometers calculate acceleration.\" INCORRECT. The older stable-platform INS uses gyros and accelerometers on a level platform. \"The IRS is most reliable using lower frequency laser beams.\" INCORRECT.

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. LEVELLING AND ALIGNMENT For a conventional gyro system, the process of levelling and alignment takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It is important that the aeroplane does not move during this process, because the resultant accelerations upset the system, preventing the platform from aligning. This process also requires corrections to be applied, which are dependent on the system being ‘told’ the accurate value of the present latitude and longitude. The alignment process is unsuccessful if the wrong latitude is initially entered into the system; if the error is small, it leads to poor alignment and degraded accuracy. If the latitude error is large, the platform is unable to align. If the longitude is however wrongly inserted during the initialisation process, it does not adversely affect the alignment process, but will affect the accuracy of any subsequent position. This is because the INS is a direct reading system, and if you start with a wrong position all subsequent positions are wrong.",

Unlike conventional gyros that maintain a level attitude by a series of gimbals, the RLG is fixed in orientation to the aeroplane axes. Any change in orientation, because of an aeroplane manoeuvre, is sensed by measuring the frequencies of two contra-rotating beams of light within the gyro. The RLG is produced from a block of a very stable glass ceramic compound, which has an extremely low coefficient of expansion. The triangular cavity contains a mixture of helium and neon gases at low pressure through which a current is passed. Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass block). The laser beam is forced to travel in both directions around the cavity. Thus, for a stationary block, the travelled paths are identical, and the frequencies of the two beams are the same at any sampling point. If the block is rotated, the effective path lengths differ; one increases, and the other decreases. Sampling at any point gives different frequencies, and if the frequency change is processed, it gives both an angular change, and a rate of angular change. By processing the difference in frequency between the two-pulsed light paths, the RLG is used as both a displacement, and as a rate gyro.",

CO ROUTE entries correspond to a company defined route in the navigation database. Adding Waypoints A waypoint can be added to the route whenever necessary. The new waypoint must first be placed into the CDU scratchpad. The new waypoint is then inserted into the route at the desired sequence point by pushing the line select key adjacent to the desired location for the new waypoint. The new entry automatically links to the preceding waypoint via a direct route. All new waypoints, except along track waypoints, cause a route discontinuity between the new waypoint and the following waypoint. Figure legend - 2: Modified Waypoint YKM waypoint is entered into the route between LAC01 and VAMPS. This modification creates a route discontinuity. When ATC asked for a change of route pilots can add new waypoints using MCDU. There is no need to be stationary to do this. Waypoint entries are not made on IRS control unit. Since it is an independent navigation mechanism from GPS waypoint entry is required.",

The main difference between the two systems is that an IRS uses solid-state sensors, such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers and gyroscopes, instead of traditional mechanical gyroscopes and accelerometers. Some of the main advantages of the more modern IRS are: - The solid-state sensors are more reliable and require less maintenance compared to mechanical gyroscopes. They also provide higher accuracy and faster response times, resulting in more precise and smoother navigation - The IRS can be integrated with other navigation systems, such as GPS or ground-based radio beacons, to provide even more accurate and reliable navigation information. - IRS systems also have the ability to compensate for various types of errors that may affect the accuracy of the navigation data. For example, errors caused by temperature changes, sensor drift, or other external factors. While traditional INS systems using mechanical gyroscopes and stand-alone computers are still in use in many aircraft today, IRS systems offer several advantages over their predecessors, including higher accuracy, faster response times, and better reliability.",

The INS/IRS also takes some time to get its own systems aligned, and judge the Earth's rotation, find True North, etc. Depending on the system (old INS's take much longer and are less accurate), this takes 5-10 minutes in mid latitudes, and up to 17 minutes at high latitudes (>70°).

It is used for the aircraft inertial navigation systems and attitude/heading reference systems. It is a very accurate system to measure rotation about a given axis and is widespread in modern commercial aircraft IRS systems. Conventional gyro’s rotation mass is replaced by two contra-rotating beams of light. The case of the RLG is made of a vitreous ceramic material of low-temperature coefficient. Two gas-tight openings are carefully designed into the single-piece case of the RLG, which are then filled with inert gas, such as a mixture of Helium and Neon. A direct current electrical discharge ionizes the gas and creates two beams of light flowing in opposite directions in the two cavities of the RLG case. In order to produce a continuous laser circuit in the enclosed area of the RLG’s case, a set of mirrors is installed to reflect and trap the laser beams. The frequency of oscillation of each beam depends on the optical path length and corresponds to the cavity resonance condition. When the RLG is stationary, both optical path lengths of each beam are identical. However, when the RLG is rotated about the axis perpendicular to the laser beams plane, one beam will travel a larger distance, and the other will cover a shorter distance. The frequency difference induced by different path lengths is proportional to the rotation rate.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. The accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Gyro-stabilised platforms are generally costly, heavy, and require a lengthy alignment procedure. With the introduction of relatively low cost, high-performance digital computers, these systems have been steadily replaced by mathematical computer software models, which modify the output signals from accelerometers that are strapped directly to the airframe. Referred to as an inertial reference system (IRS), it works on the same fundamental principles as the INS. The strap-down system dispenses with the gimbal mounted stable element and instead uses solid-state ring laser gyros (RLG). These gyros are not required to stabilise the accelerometers, as in the case of an INS, but provide aeroplane orientation, by determining the rate of rotation around each of the aeroplane axes.",

Most aircraft of any size will be fitted with at least two inertial systems. The duplication is for redundancy and so that the information can be compared for possible error. The starting point for an inertial navigation system is acceleration. If acceleration is known, then the aircraft's speed can be calculated. If the speed is known, the distance travelled can be calculated. To solve a complete navigation problem in space, we need to know the acceleration in three axes at right angles to each other. The inertial system relates its acceleration to the three axes and recognizes the direction, using three methods: Stable Platform or Stabilised Inertial Platform Wander Angle Strapdown The Stable Platform, which keeps the platform, on which the accelerometers are mounted, always level and aligned to North, and also measures acceleration relative to the platform. Alignment and levelling is done only once for each flight with the aircraft stationary on the ground. Once aligned, the inertial system is not and cannot be re-aligned for the remainder of the flight. Attitude data is still valid, and will continue to drive servo attitude and heading instruments or EFIS indications.",

The ADC collects relevant air data, automatically eliminates the position errors of its individual sensors, computes the required output parameters and provides them to as many systems as desired. Some air data can be displayed without further computations. These are the TAT, altitude and IAS. Because systems errors are internally corrected, IAS is equal to CAS. The centralised processing of air data parameters allows for the computation of additional outputs, which could not be obtained from separate instruments. TAT can be converted to the actual outside air temperature (OAT) considering the flight Mach number. Once OAT has been determined, it can be used to obtain TAS from the corrected values for static and total pressure (which is CAS). TAS can then be used, for example, by the IRS to determine the actual wind from heading, track and ground speed.",

This system relies on no external references, is unaffected by weather, and can operate during the day or night. The products of an INS are position (latitude/longitude), speed (kt), distance (nautical miles), and other navigational information. The quality of information is dependent on the accuracy of the initial (input) data, and the precision with which the system aligns to True North. For navigation in a horizontal plane, two accelerometers are needed, which are normally aligned with True North and True East. To keep the reference valid, the accelerometers are mounted on a gyro-stabilised platform, which maintains the correct orientation during all aeroplane manoeuvres. Rate integrating gyros are for use as sensors to detect any departure of the platform from its level and desired alignment. BOUNDED ERRORS These errors build up to a maximum positive and negative values, and return to zero within each 84.4 minutes Schuler cycle and thus averages out over the period. The main causes of these errors are: - platform tilt, due to initial misalignment - inaccurate measurement of acceleration by accelerometers - integrator errors in the first integration stage UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE TRACK ERRORS These errors arise from the misalignment of the accelerometers in the horizontal plane, and the main causes of these errors are: - Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform. - Wander of the azimuth gyro. UNBOUNDED ERRORS - CUMULATIVE DISTANCE ERROR These errors give rise to cumulative errors in the recording of the total distance travelled. The main causes of this error are: - Wander in the levelling gyros. - Integrator errors in the second stage of integration. INHERENT ERRORS The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. Such errors vary from system to system, depending upon the balance achieved between accuracy on one hand and the simplicity of design, reliability, ease of construction and cost of production on the other.",

The irregular shape and composition of the Earth, together with the movement of the Earth through space, and other factors provide further possible sources of error. By entering the initial position and recording the IRU operation hours, the flight crew can compare the calculated position at the end of the flight with the actual position to determine the drift. RADIAL ERROR This error provides an indication of the continuing serviceability of the INS, and is derived from the following: Radial Error = Distance of final ramp position from INS position / Elapsed time in hours, expressed in (NM/hour) When calculating the distance between two positions, consider the latitude. It is also good practice to monitor the performance of the INS at the end of each flight. Comparing the INS display with the ramp position does this, where the radial error is established using Pythagoras, which when divided by the recorded time in the navigation mode, gives the average error.",

Initial position – because actual aircraft position at any point during the flight, is calculated from the distance and direction flown from the initial reference position entered in the system. Barometric altitude – to stabilize the vertical navigation, thus stabilizing vertical velocity and inertial altitude information. The platform can output the inertial height by itself, but its accuracy is insufficient for precise height control, hence the barometric altitude input. The initial alignment and leveling of the IRS need to be carried out when the aircraft is stationary and on the ground. A set of three accelerometers will sense gravitational acceleration that will derive the local vertical of the platform. Once the vertical is found thanks to the gravity, any change of attitude in space will be detected, but they will only come from the Earth’s rotation (on the ground when stationary). Moreover, by detecting the drift due to the earth’s rotation, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) will be able to internally calculate the True North. Latitude can also be internally calculated, but because this calculation is not sufficiently precise, a manual position input is required from the flight crew for this alignment sequence. Therefore, the system will compare the inserted latitude with the calculated one and compute precisely the aircraft’s position. On the other hand, the IRS cannot calculate/measure longitude, therefore the only reference is the one provided by the pilot during the alignment process.",

If you do have any further exam feedback, please let us know in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Inertial Navigation Systems are devices which allow us to have a self contained method of navigating, via just the accelerations of the aircraft. The basic principle is that, if an INS knows the initial location of the aircraft, and knows that it is completely still at that time (during initialisation), then it can precisely measure the aircraft's turns and accelerations to calculate its current position. It uses the mathematical process of integration to first work out the aircraft's velocity and direction, then integrates again to find the change in distance, which it then adds/removes from the original location. The oldest INSs use a \"stable platform\" design, which is a large platform that is kept pointing towards True North and perfectly upright, no matter the aircraft's heading or attitude. It manages this by using 3 rate-integrating gyros to measure the aircraft's turns around all three axes, and counter them by moving the platform the other way. It can then use 2 accelerometers to calculate the North-South acceleration, and the East-West accelerations, which are fed into a mechanical computer (a complex set of cogs and gears) that provide an output of speed and position, and other useful metrics. More modern aircraft use Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs), which are a form of INS, but are connected directly to the aircraft (no stable platform). These are much lighter, and less complex to have on board, as they use a set of 3 ring laser gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers to measure all the rotations and accelerations, and then calculates into their various components (North-South, East-West and Vertical) using modern computer methods. This is called a strapdown system, as it is fixed to the aircraft, and is much more usable with other systems, as it can feed info to the FMS, etc. This question is not very well worded, as the question is asking about inertial navigation systems, but the most correct answer (and the answer from feedback) is actually more related to IRSs. To clarify, we can go through each option: \"true airspeed (TAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" This is quite blatantly wrong, airspeed is measured in one axis by the pitot tubes. \"indicated Airspeed (IAS) on the x, y and z axes.\" Same as above, still wrong. \"acceleration along the aircraft's pitch, roll and yaw axes.\" This one is nearly correct, as it does sense accelerations, but not necessarily along these axes (and these axes refer to rotations). INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions (and maybe vertically). \"acceleration along the north-south, east-west and vertical axes.\" This is most correct, but only just. As mentioned above, INSs sense accelerations in the North-South and East-West directions. They can sense vertical accelerations also, if they have a third accelerometer, but this is not so well documented in the learning objectives, and is more to do with IRSs, which all measure vertical acceleration as part of their normal process. This is why this question can garner some opposing views, depending on interpretation. So far, this is our best option.",

This means ensuring the autopilot does not break aircraft limitations in terms of speed, load factor, pitch and bank limits etc. The autopilot should be able to use a satisfactory amount of the performance of the aircraft otherwise the manoeuvres would take too long to execute. Whenever the autopilot is required to make a correction either for stability or when referring to a particular flight path, the control response will always be in proportion to deviation or corrective action required but only up to a limit that prevents the autopilot attempting a manoeuvre that would cause an excursion from the safe flight envelope. Command Speed Limiting The AFS provides speed, pitch and thrust commands to avoid exceeding the following limit speeds: - VMO/MMO. - Wing flap limiting speeds. - Landing gear speeds. - Minimum speed. Reversion Modes During some flight situations, speed control by the AFDS or A/T alone could be insufficient to prevent exceeding a limit speed. If this occurs, AFDS and A/T mode automatically revert to a more effective combination. The reversion modes are: - Placard Limit reversion. - Minimum airspeed reversion. Mode reversion occurs slightly before reaching the limit speed. Flight Envelope Protection Flight envelope protection is installed with the aim of ensuring that the aircraft remains within the normal flight envelope in all phases of flight The system provides protection in all phases of flight to prevent the aircraft exceeding the limits for the following parameters: - Angle of Attack - Speed - Pitch attitude - Bank angle - Loadfactor",

In other words, it off-loads any steady-state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes.

In simple words, hand control inputs or mode control panel inputs create a deviation signal. Using control laws, the computer creates an output to the servo actuators to move the control surfaces.",

            "explanation": "The automatic pitch trim is used to: ensure the airplane is properly trimmed when the autopilot is disengaged. permits the elevator to always be in neutral position with respect to the horizontal stabilizer. In other words, it off-loads any steady-state elevator deflection. When the autopilot is engaged, the role of the automatic pitch trim is to relieve the autopilot servo motor and return the aircraft in-trim when disconnecting the autopilot. It basically provides a smooth ‘HAND-OVER’ when disengaging the autopilot. Caution! Do not confuse the auto trim with the automatic synchronization function which is providing a smooth `TAKE-OVER` when engaging the autopilot. The auto synchronization function will prevent the autopilot engagement it is inoperative, as this might result in an abrupt snatch and jerks of the autopilot during engagement. For an airplane fitted with a mechanical flight control system, the automatic pitch trim system is active whenever the autopilot is engaged. On the other hand, when flying a fly-by-wire aircraft, the automatic pitch trim is always active either you are flying it manually or with the autopilot engaged. When flying an FBW aircraft manually, the system eliminates the need for the pilot to make control column inputs (or manual trim) to compensate for flight path parameter alterations such as thrust changes, landing gear configuration changes, or slats/flaps configuration changes. Summary: `HAND-OVER` - automatic pitch trim function. `TAKE-OVER` - automatic synchronization function.",

Therefore, if the indicator indicates a right deviation, it means that the desired track is right of the aircraft. In this case, if the flight director shows a left deflection it means that the aircraft needs a slight correction to the left in order to intercept the desired track in the most efficient way. This would be common, for instance, shortly before reaching the desired radial - the flight director will move left so that the aircraft doesn't overshoot the desired track.
