            "explanation": "Some questions might give you a range of wind values and TAS values at various altitudes and a true track and ask for the average groundspeed. In these cases, the TAS and W/V to use on the Flight/Nav computer is as follows: For Climb problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The aircraft climbs from MSL (0 ft) to FL270. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: 0 ft + [2/3 x (27 000)] ft = 18000 ft For the wind velocity at 18 000 ft then, we would usually have to interpolate 3/5ths of the way from 15 000 ft to 20 000 ft, but the winds are the same so no interpolation necessary. We can use the wind velocity 310º(T)/45 kt. For OAT, the ISA temperature at 18 000 ft is 15 - 2(18) = -21ºC, and the OAT is ISA +5ºC, so OAT = -16ºC To find the groundspeed, we first needs to calculate the TAS. (We have used a CRP-5 and the wind-down method here) On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 18 000 ft with the OAT of -16ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 280 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 373 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is over 300 kt, this needs to be corrected. In the COMP. CORR. window, calculate and apply the small correction in the direction of the arrow (only 0.7 divisions). Go back to the CAS of 280 kt on the inner scale, and read off the new TAS of 369 kt on the outer scale. The Groundspeed can be found using the wind side of the computer. Set wind direction 310ºT under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the centre point on the TAS of 369 kt * Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially set the True Track 045°T under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would give 6º drift and a track of 051º, so reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 045º. This occurs at a heading of 038º with 7º Right drift. The groundspeed of this track is approximately 370 kt Therefore the average groundspeed for the climb is 370 kt, closest answer 371 kt. *Note: If your flight computer does not include high speeds, set 269 kt or 169 kt at the center point as TAS (TAS - 100 kt or TAS - 200 kt) and follow the rest of the procedure. At the final Ground Speed result you will need to add the 100 kt or 200 kt that you subtracted from TAS.",

Note that this heading would result in 17ºR drift and a track of 197º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 180º. This occurs at a heading of 163º with 17ºR (+) drift. WCA and drift are opposite to each other and of equal magnitude. A drift of 17ºR corresponds to a WCA of 17ºL (-). Triangle of Velocities: When creating the velocity triangle using the provided data, a right-angled triangle is established. This right angle corresponds to the angle formed by the W/V vector and the Ground Speed/True Track vector. If we denote θ as the angle between the Ground Speed/True Track vector and the True Airspeed/True Heading vector, the relationship can be expressed as follows: sin(θ) = Wind Velocity/True Airspeed = 30/100 = 0.3 ⇒ θ = 17.46º ≈ 17°. Since the True Airspeed/True Heading Vector is to the Left of the Ground Speed/True Track vector, we get that: Wind Correction Angle = 17° Left or -17°.",

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (3/15) x 60 = 12º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (3 / (105 - 15)) x 60 = 2º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 12º + 2º = 14º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to its orbital elliptical path around the Sun at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth's equator is 23.5o. The Sun will be exactly overhead 23.5o N in June, when \"the northern hemisphere summer solstice\" takes place and we have the longest day. Also, it will be overhead 23.5o S in December, when \"the northern hemisphere winter solstice\" will take place and we will have the longest night. The latitudes 23.5o N and 23.5o S are called the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively and represent the highest latitudes where the Sun will be directly overhead. The tilt of the Earth's axis is responsible for the longer nights in winter and the longer days in summer. It also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. Between the solstices are the Equinoxes, when the Sun is passing over the Equator, where night and day are of equal length. The equinoxes are the times when the relative length of night and day and the elevation of the noon sun, known as the declination of the Sun, are changing at the greatest rate. If you consider the time of sunrise at different points on the Earth's surface, it quickly becomes clear that the Sun rises at different times at different longitudes, because of the rotation of the Earth and different latitudes, because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively).",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

True direction (T) Variation (V) Magnetic direction (M) 105º 15ºE 090º Wind Correction Angle of +13º implies a correction to the right, resulting in a Wind Correction Angle of 13º Right. This adjustment shifts the True Heading to the right of the True Track by 13º. Therefore, the True Heading can be determined by adding 13º to the True Track True Heading = True Track + 013º = 105º + 013º = 118º. Follow the steps detailed below in order to find unknown wind (CRP-5 method): Adjust the slide until the centre dot aligns with the arc corresponding to True Airspeed (465 kt). Rotate the window disc to position the True Heading (118º) beneath the TRUE HEADING index. Calculate the Drift Angle. With True Track at 105º, derive Drift Angle as 13º Left (Port) from the window disc. Identify the point on the slide where the Left Drift Angle of 13º intersects the arc for Ground Speed (480 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline BELOW the center dot. Determine Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the vector between the center dot and the pencil mark. In this case, with the center dot on the 465 arc and the pencil mark on the (approximately) 357 kt arc, the Wind Velocity is approximately 108 kt (465 - 357 = 108). Read the (True) Wind Direction below the TRUE HEADING index. With the value 209 below the TRUE HEADING index, ascertain that the (True) Wind Direction is 209º.",

In this case, we can read a GS of approximately 369 kt. 6) Now, we can determine the drift angle. The end of the like is approximately at 5º Right, meaning that our drift angle equals approximately 5ºR. Please note that drift angle is simply \"how many degrees\" the Track is to the left or right of the Heading. If the Track is to the Left of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Left. If the Track is to the Right of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Right. Considering the above statement, we can conclude that the track equals 186º (TH + Drift = 181º + 5º = 186º)",

Map reading is the determination of aircraft's position, by matching natural or built-up features with their corresponding symbols on a chart. Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring, where the pilot must be able to visualise the terain and physical features from symbols on the map. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. The choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. The rule for choosing a ground feature is to find something as unique as possible, such as masts, railways, rivers, bridges, etc. Also, the map to ground technique is recommended to avoid confirmation bias, for instance spotting a tower on the ground and convincing yourself that it is the church tower you would dearly like it to be on the map. For this question, the pilot chose ground features (towers, villages) as turning points, which are identical with many others and can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. Also, VFR navigation at lower levels, as in our case 1500 ft above ground, restricts the view ahead and around by the next fold of high ground and objects may only appear when you are close to them and when they are not obscured by high ground. Probably, the pilot changed course at a wrong village, because of his/her low cruise altitude and not recommended ground features choice.",

To re-join the original track at A, we must find the track correction to reach B. For that, we need to find the distance off-track first. We have been given the Track Angle Error (TKE) of 5º to the right. We can determine the distance off track by applying the following formula: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track 5º = (distance off track × 60) ÷ 48 distance off track = (5º x 48) ÷ 60 = 4 NM The correction to reach B will be: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 30 TKE = 8° ⇒ Turning 5º to the left will lead us to fly parallel to the original track. Turning an extra 8° to the left will direct us to \"B\". 5° + 8° = 13° to the left to go direct to \"B\".",

This exercise is asking us to determine the actual wind, and we will solve it using with the flight computer. To determine the actual wind we need the information related to actual path of aircraft over the ground, G/S and actual track and as well the TAS and actual heading information. Based on the forecasted wind, and using the flight computer we can determine the aircraft planned heading and G/S. Solving from Heading (HDG), knowing WV, TAS and required track. Set wind direction to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 190 kt. Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 355º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 7ºR drift and a track of 362º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 355º. This occurs at a heading of 348º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 186 kt. At a ground speed of 186 kt, after 30 min of flight, the distance covered should be 93 NM. However, according to the question text, tha aircraft is 4.5 NM ahead = 97.5 NM. Therefore, the actual ground speed = 97.5 NM x 2 = 195 kt To determine the actual track over the ground, we will calculate the actual TKE and add it to the planned track. TEK = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TEK = ( 3,5 / (93 + 4,5) ) x 60 = 2ºR 2º right means that the actual track of the aircraft over the ground is 355º + 2º = 357º Knowing the GS 195 kt, TAS 190 kt, heading 348º and track 357º, it is possible to determine the actual wind using the flight computer by following the steps below: Determining winds with the flight computer: Set True Heading (348ºT) under \"True Index\" Place centre dot over TAS (190 kts) Mark the point where drift (9ºR) and GS (195 kt) meet. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (253º) Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (190 - 160 = 30 kt) Actual W/V = 253º / 30 kt",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of GNAV, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their General Navigation exam.",

Density altitude is not particularly important to GNAV specifically, and calculating it is not part of the GNAV learning objectives, so you should appeal this question if you see it in a GNAV exam. Feedback from one authority shows that has been seen in this exam. Density altitude is a measure of the environmental air density, in comparison to where you would find that same density in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), so you end up with an altitude measurement. A high density altitude means low air density, and a low density altitude means high air density (what you would get at low-level). Density altitude can be calculated in 2 main ways, by flight computer or by mathematical calculation. By flight computer (CRP-5) it is relatively simple, in the \"AIR SPEED\" window, line up the pressure altitude with the OAT, and read off the density altitude in the \"DENSITY ALTITUDE\" window (x1000 ft). In this case, you get just under 9000 ft, but this is not the most accurate measurement in the world. We could show a picture in the annex, but flight computers are each very slightly different, so different answers could easily be found on different computers. By mathematical calculation, you take the pressure altitude, and adjust it for temperature by 120 ft per °C different from ISA. As high temperature is lower density, this means that higher than ISA temperature means a higher density altitude, and lower than ISA temperature means a lower density altitude. ISA temperature at 5500 ft (FL55) is 15 - 2(5.5) = 4°C, so with an OAT of +33°C, we are at ISA +29°C, meaning our density altitude is higher than our pressure altitude. The difference is 120 ft/°C x 29°C = 3480 ft, so the Density altitude is 5500 + 3480 = 8980 ft, closest answer 9000 ft",

The Tailwind component (TWC) is: Wind speed x Cos of the Angle difference between Rwy and Wind direction = 15 kt x Cos (330° - 190°) = 12 kt approx. NOTES: Both wind and runway directions are magnetic, thus you don't have to apply any variation. Any written meteorological information (TAF, METAR, SIGMET, etc) will be given in true direction. Any wind direction given by the ATC is magnetic and the runway is also a magnetic direction. So, no need to apply the variation given.",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 150 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 266º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 274º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 160 kt. It is normal during flight that the track over the ground is different from the desired trajectory defined during planning. If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 GS = 160 kts Planned track distance flown = 160 x 15’ = 40 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 NM.

When following a magnetic track of 250°M, its true track is: 250°M + 10°E = 260°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 8° Left, its heading is: 260°T + 8° = 268°T.

A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 180 kt and put true heading 268°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 8° left drift. Now put the next heading 342°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 8° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 305°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (180) and the value under the drift lines intersection (144): 180 kt - 144 kt = 36 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 305°/ 36 kt.",

(1) Place the track (316º) under the true index. (2) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the ground speed (144 kt). (3) The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value then the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. (4) Maintaining the central grommet over the GS line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS and make a pencil mark. (5) Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centerline between the grommet and the true index. (6) Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark: 35 kt. (7) Read the true wind direction under the true index: 245º.",

Converting this to Kelvin: 273 - 46.5 = 226.5 K. Now, calculate TAS: TAS = 0.86 x 38.95 √ 226.5 = 504 kt.

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance) x 60 1.5 nm is the off-track distance; know we need to determine the distance flown along the planned track. 12' x 150 = 30 nm TE = (1.5/30) x 60 = 3º Though the wind is 160º that could lead us to think that error is to 3 º L, the question states that the aircraft is right of track.",

Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is the highest Latitude listed below at which the sun will rise above the horizon and set every day\" is 64º. However, according to feedback, it seems that there is a question where the option “64º” is not available. In such case, we have received feedback which confirms the correct option to be “62º”. At the moment, there might be 2 different versions of this question (yet to be confirmed): When the options available include 62º and 64º, the correct option is 64º. When the options available include 62º and all remaining options are higher or equal to 66.5º. In this case, the correct option is 62º.

The variation with magnetic latitude occurs because the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field varies in strength depending where it is detected. At the magnetic equator, all the field is in the horizontal component, at the poles the horizontal component is weak to non-existent.

            "explanation": "The Earth is roughly spherical. Because of its spin it is slightly fatter at the equator and slightly flattened at the poles, a shape known as an oblate spheroid or an ellipsoid. You might come across the term \"Geoid\". In geodesy, a reference ellipsoid is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid. Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude and elevation are defined. Modern navigation systems, like GPS, ude these reference systems and the most common of these is the World Geodetic System of 1984 or WGS 84, created by the United States military. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic latitude is the angle that a line drawn perpendicular to the surface through a point on a spheroid makes with the equatorial plane (plumb-line on the ellipsoid) and is other than the geocentric (earth centred) latitude. Despite the fact that, in general navigation, we assume that one degree of latitude along a meridian equals to 60 nm. In fact, using a WGS84 ellipsoid, one degree of latitude has a length of 59.7 nm (110.574 km) at the equator and increases progressively with increasing latitude up to 60.3 nm (111.694 km) at the poles.",

True track (T) Variation (V) Magnetic track (M) 060º 15º E 045º Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (130 kt). (2) Place wind direction (190º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (30 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (060º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (130 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 147 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => 10ºR. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, True Heading = TT + 10ºR = 060º + 10ºR = 070º(T) Convert true heading into Magnetic: Use the mnemonic: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

            "explanation": "The aircraft initially flies South, i.e. 180° along a meridian, for 416 NM to point B. It is known that \"1' change of latitude along a meridian or the Equator equals to 1 NM\". So, 416 NM along a meridian correspond to: 416' or 6° 56' change of latitude. Since the aircraft flies South, the latitude will decrease and the latitude at point B will be: 48°12’ N - 6° 56' = 41°16’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point B will be: 41°16’ N 004°52’ E. After point B, the aircraft continues East, i.e. 090° along a parallel of latitude, for 200 NM to point C. The distance along a parallel of latitude is given by the formula: Departure (NM) = Change of Longitude(') x Cosine of Latitude. Solving for Change of Longitude('), we get: Change of Longitude(') = Departure (NM) / Cosine of Latitude = 200 NM / Cos 41,27° = 266' or 4.43° or 4° 26'. Since the aircraft flies East, the longitude will increase and the longitude at point C will be: 004°52’E + 4° 26' = 009°18’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point C will be: 41°16’ N 009°18’ E.",

            "explanation": "A great circle is the largest possible circle that can be drawn around a sphere. All spheres have great circles. If you cut a sphere at one of its great circles, you'd cut it exactly in half. A great circle has the same circumference, or outer boundary, and the same centre point as its sphere. The geometry of spheres is useful for mapping the Earth and other planets. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but it maintains the general shape. All the meridians on Earth are parts great circles. Meridian and its anti meridian for a great circle. Meridians, including the prime meridian, are the north-south lines we use to help describe exactly where we are on the Earth. All these lines of longitude meet at the poles, cutting the Earth neatly in half. The Equator is another of the Earth's great circles. If you were to cut into the Earth right on its Equator, you'd have two equal halves: the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator is the only east-west line that is a great circle. All other parallels (lines of latitude) get smaller as you get near the poles. Great circles can be found on spheres as big as planets and as small as oranges. If you cut an orange exactly in half, the line you cut is the orange's great circle. And until you eat one or both halves, you have two equal hemispheres of the same orange. Great circles are also useful in planning routes. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere is always a segment of a great circle. Plotting great circles comes in very handy for airplane pilots trying to fly the shortest distance between two points.",

The Earth is, therefore, an irregularly shaped ellipsoid, which is flattened at the poles and bulges at the Equator. This is slightly squished shape is called geoid.

The aircraft departs at 12:15 and we know that at 12:27 (after 12 minutes), the aircraft has covered 40 NM. Ground speed = (40 ÷ 12) x 60 = 200 kt The off track error of 4 NM (1 NM + 3 NM) is recognized at 12:37. We need to calculate the distance along track and the TKE (Track Angle Error) at this position. Time from A to railroad track (40 NM) ⇒ 12:27 - 12:15 = 12 min Time from railroad track to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12:37 - 12:27 = 10 min Time from A to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12 min + 10 min = 22 min If the aircraft's ground speed is 200 kt, in 22 minutes, it will cover: (200 kt x 22 min) ÷ 60 = 73 NM Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 73 TKE = 3° (approx.) If we alter our heading by 3.3° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: Distance to go = 80 NM - 73 NM = 7 NM TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 7 TKE = 34° (approx.) So turning 3° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 34° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 3° + 34° = 37º (approx.) would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the right, therefore we must fly 37º to the left. Track = 235º - 37º = 198º The aircraft is 80 NM – 73 NM = 7 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 7 NM in 2 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:37 + 2 min = 12:39",

Based on that, the circumference of the Earth may be calculated as follows: Earth circumference at the Equator = 360º x 60 NM = 21 600 NM => 21 600 NM x 1.852 = 40 000 km Circumference = π x diameter (π = 3.14) 40 000 km = π x diameter diameter = 40 000 km ÷ π diameter = 12 732 km Alternatively, you can just remember that the Earth's circumference (the distance all the way around the equator) is approximately 40 000 km (21 600 NM) and its diameter (the distance from one side to the other through Earth's center) is roughly 12 700 km.",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 280 kt. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºR drift and a track of 275º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 265º with 5ºR drift. All this means is that, to counteract an expected drift of 5ºR, the aircraft flew a heading of 265º(T). However, after covering a distance of 60 NM, our track error angle is 10º left, meaning our track made good has been 260º (T) Calculating the difference between our heading and the track made good results in 5º to the left (265ºT to 260ºT). The average drift observed from 10:20 UTC to 10:32 UTC amounts to 5º to the left. Note: Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading.

The fuel amount to cater for things that don't go to plan, such as stronger headwinds, re-routing, a flight level other than expected, is called \"Contingency fuel\". Also, any aircraft must be landed with at least the Final Reserve Fuel in its tanks. If it looks like that it will land with less than Final Reserve Fuel, EU OPS says that the pilot must declare an emergency. But, for this question the Contingency fuel may not be sufficient and so as to avoid any consumption of the Final Reserve Fuel while being still on the air before landing, the best action is to reduce, as much as possible, the remaining ground distance and flight time until the destination, by turning before the scheduled turning point and flying directly to the destination, provided that the ATC is informed of the pilot's intentions accordingly and no safety issues emerge. An emergency landing at the nearest suitable field may pose at risk both the passengers and the aircraft and would be recommended in case the remaining fuel was not sufficient to reach at any other suitable airfield. Flying to a lower altitude would decrease the TAS and the Groundspeed, thus the required flight time and fuel to destination would increase. Any orbit would further increase the flight time and total fuel consumption until destination. Further instructions from the ATC should be asked while continuing towards the destination without wasting flight time.",

The limited visibility at night might cause difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points to verify the position of the aircraft and cross-check the aircraft track, thus there is a danger of flying into terrain in the case of being lost. Therefore, the difficulty to identify the navigation features at night is the most significant hazard because it directly affects the pilot's ability to navigate safely and accurately during the flight. Tall obstacles at night are properly marked, and can be managed with proper planning, preparation, and adherence to procedures designed for night flying. Note: The difficulty to the pilots in identifying landmarks and reference points is caused due to limited visibility, so the choice 'Limited visibility and off-navigation challenges.' is a hazard but the most significant aspect of limited visibility is the inability to identify the landmarks. This is why the choice 'Difficulty in identifying landmarks and reference points.' is chosen the correct one.",

Consider using any radio-navigation aids that may be available to give position information. 4. If short of fuel or near controlled airspace and not in contact with ATC, set 121.5 MHz and make a PAN call. 5. If that is not necessary, check the directional indicator (DI) and compass are still synchronised and continue to fly straight and level and on route plan heading. 6. Estimate the distance travelled since the last known position. 7. Compare the ground with your estimated position on the map. 8. Once the position has been re-established, keep checking the heading and continue the flight by updating the estimated position regularly while looking for unique features such as hills, valleys, lakes, wood, built-up areas, rivers, coastlines, motorways and railways.",

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower?",

When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. A tall rectangular building is a suitable ground feature for VFR navigation, because it is has the following characteristics: It has enough vertical extent to be identified from a considerable distance and altitude, and it has a distinctive shape that makes it easily recognizable. It is prominent and unique, standing out against the surrounding terrain. It makes contrast with its surroundings due to differences in shape and elevation.",

Frequent changes may be needed to maintain the correct airspeed, while climbing or descending over undulating ground. The view ahead and around is restricted by the next fold of high ground. The angle at which you are looking becomes flatter and if a feature does not have some vertical extent, you are unlikely to see it at low level. A selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Thus, it will be difficult to fly past them. As for the question's options: Features with great vertical extent can be easily seen. The pilot feels that flies at a higher groundspeed.

They are all asking for the best VFR features but have different options. We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. PICKING THE BEST VFR CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. With regards to this question, large water reservoir and tall masts are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique. Farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby. Telephone lines are very difficult to see from high up.",

The VFR charts depict topographic features and other information of interest to pilots flying visually, such as major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, airspace boundaries, etc. During VFR navigation, the cadets are usually instructed to hold the map oriented to the direction of flight, so that the surrounding topographic features can be easily identified, i.e. hold the map so that direction of flight is at the top (not North), also known as \"track-up\", so \"right\" on the map will correspond to \"right\" on the ground and map reading will be easier. Using the chart “track-up”, gives the best situational awareness to the crew and it can also be useful to check if the aircraft is on the planned position by checking if the ground features coincide with your expectations. Also, for convenience during flight, it is not necessary to hold the whole navigation chart, but it is preferred to hold only a a relevant with the trip part of the whole chart, so as not to reduce the pilot's field of view and handling effectiveness. \"North-up\" map orientation is mainly suggested for flight planning.",

Accidents where the aircraft is out of control at the point of impact are not known as CFIT. Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT.

            ],
            "explanation": "\"An 400 ft radio mast on the horizon.\" INCORRECT. Identifying features with significant vertical extent, such as masts and mountains, is crucial for safety during flight. However, they also serve as excellent visual checkpoints due to their visibility from a distance, especially in favorable weather conditions. These features become valuable references for navigation purposes. However, It's essential to recognize that the usefulness of features with substantial vertical extent may decrease as you fly at higher altitudes. When flying at 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL), a 400-foot-high mast might become difficult to spot due to its diminished visual prominence. \"A railroad perpendicular to the track.\" CORRECT. This is a conspicuous landmark with a great extent which can be easily located and identified from the altitude at which a VFR flight is normally operating. since this road is crossing perpendicularly the planned track, the crossing point could be used to check for any time deviation and to calculate the actual ground speed. \"A straight highway along the calculated track.\" INCORRECT. A landmark, even if easily identifiable, is not useful to check the aircraft's groundspeed as it wil not be crossing the path at any point. When flying, because of the great extent along the track, a second conspicuous landmark close to the crossing point is required. \"A large waterway in the direction of the aircraft’s nose.\" INCORRECT. While a large waterway can be a visual reference point and used as a checkpoint, it may not be as accurate or easy to measure ground speed as a perpendicular railroad track. Determining ground speed using a waterway may involve more challenges including, in this case, lack of perpendicular reference: Unlike a railroad track, which runs perpendicular to your flight path, a waterway may or may not be at a right angle to your track. Measuring the time it takes to fly over a distance along the waterway may not directly correspond to your ground speed due to the angle between your flight path and the waterway.",

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? With regards to this question, large lakes, tall masts and an active power station are good checkpoints. Areas with small woods and streets in a town are not unique.",

As always, any feedback from the real exam is very useful, and please let us know which authority you sat with as well, thanks! The choice of ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. When flying in the winter, it is often necessary to rely on more prominent ground features. So, among others, you should also consider: The size and the uniqueness of the features. Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent, such as high radio masts or large, conspicuous buildings will be easier to identify. Time of year. Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. For example, after a recent snowfall, roads and railway lines may be totally obscured, woods and farmlands can blend in to surrounding fields, but big lakes and rivers might stand out more. Coastlines in particular will stand out firmly from the surroundings, as their appearance is not affected by snowfall. The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is low (for example a white building against snowy white terrain), then the range at which objects can be seen is reduced, and the ease of seeing them is reduced also. This particular landscape has pros and cons, as the buildings are mostly white, which do not stand out well against snow covered ground, however, it must be noted that this particular building is incredibly large, not fully white coloured, and certainly would be lit due to its size (it is over 500 ft tall). The image also includes lakes, rivers and is next to a coastline, which would be very easy to pick out in the snow. This is the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida, USA.",

Rather, they are considered uncontrolled flight into terrain. Similarly, incidents resulting from deliberate acts, such as terrorism or suicide by the pilot, are also not considered to be CFIT. One major factor of CFIT is the loss of situational awareness — failing to know at all times what the aircraft’s position is, how that position relates to the altitude of the surface immediately below and ahead, and how both relate to the course being flown. One of the contributory factors is weather: Rain, turbulence, clouds and icing, may increase the workload of the pilot and cause interference reducing the accuracy of radio navigation beacons. Poor visibility, particularly at night can contribute to disorientation and loss of situational awareness.",

We have seen lots of different feedback for these questions and think that there are a few versions used by EASA. So far the \"rule\" for these questions is that \"farm land\" is never correct, and if high tension power lines are present, they are correct (that is a debatable point but sometimes they are a good VFR feature, particularly in forest areas). After that, it is common sense. This particular question states that \"large water features\" are not correct, and that aligns with recent feedback for this question, however, \"large water features\" are correct for question 615371, due to the different options. The wording might be different in the exam, which might make it clearer why this is the case. This question has also been seen as a \"choose 3\" question in the UK CAA. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice.

Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. However, if it is a large lake amongst other large lakes, it may be easily confused. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Is it the only town of that size for many miles? Power lines: These aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. EASA do like them as VFR features though, so bear that in mind.",

Visual navigation is the use of topographical maps to monitor or fix the aircraft's position. Map reading is the determination of aircraft's position, by matching natural or built-up features with their corresponding symbols on a chart. Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, as in our case, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. For this route, there are many identical ground features (airports, towns, villages), which can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. As soon as the position of the aircraft is in doubt: Note the time Communicate, if in contact with an ATC unit to request assistance Consider using any ground navigational aids that may be available to give position information etc. For this question, the pilot should be advised by RODING VOR/DME along the whole trip, which is the only ground navigational aid in the vicinity of the route's turning points, so as to ensure that he follows his planned route and to correct promptly any inattention which may cause any inadvertent drift. If tuned on the RODING VOR/DME frequency, the pilot will figure out that instead of Radial 130o from RODING VOR/DME, which intersects the planned turning point VILSHOFEN airport, he/she finally is on Radial 110o from the same VOR/DME, which intersects the non-scheduled turning point ELSENTHAL-GRAFENAU airport.",

When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration. The selected feature has a white colour. On a winter day, during a special VFR flight with low clouds, reduced visibility, and a snowy surface, the feature will have the same colour with the ground and the surrounding features. This means that it will not make any visual contrast with the surrounding terrain and the pilot will find it extremely difficult to recognize it.",

Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air.

But, the power lines are rarely installed over mountain ridges and if installed their height is quite low. \"Represent a danger when power lines cross a valley.\" - CORRECT: In most cases the power lines cross valleys rather than ridges. Over a snowy area, the high voltage power lines can be easily distinguished, but not the low voltage ones due to their smaller vertical extent.",

These landmarks should be easily locatable and distinguishable from the VFR flight altitude. Using these landmarks, pilots can monitor flight progress and calculate ground speed. \"1. Dual-carriageway (four line) road crossing the intended track.\" INCORRECT. This is a prominent landmark, yet its vast expanse presents challenges for pilots in accurately identifying the precise crossing point from the air. As a result, it is advisable not to rely solely on this landmark for drift error checks. \"2. Dual-carriageway (four line) road crossing a river close to the intended track.\" CORRECT. This prominent landmark lies in close proximity to the intended flight track, distinguished by its substantial size and stark contrast against the surroundings. During the planning stage, pilots can use its position as a reference point relative to the track. While in-flight, comparing the aircraft's position with this easily identifiable landmark on the chart enables the assessment of any potential drift error. \"3. Disused railway crossing a river on intended track.\" CORRECT. Even though the railway line is disused, the point where this railway line crosses the river can be easily located due to the color contrast with the surroundings. \"Single carriageway (two line) road crossing a railway close to intended track.\" CORRECT. Similar to a Dual-carriageway (four-line) road, this conspicuous landmark lies in close proximity to the intended flight track and can be easily located and identified from the altitude of a VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flight. By cross-referencing the aircraft's position relative to this landmark during the flight, the pilot can pinpoint their location on the chart and assess for any potential drift error.",

            "explanation": "NOTE: There is another question in the database that is similar to this question (615463) and asks for the best VFR features, but it has different options. We have seen many different feedback for these questions and we believe there are several versions used by EASA. So far the ‘rule’ for these questions is that ‘farmland’ is never correct and if high-tension power lines are present, they are correct (this is a debatable point, but sometimes a good VFR feature, particularly in forested areas). After that, it is common sense. Checkpoints are prominent buildings or landmarks that can be visually easy to identify from the air. PICKING THE BEST CHECKPOINTS Finding a good VFR checkpoint is a matter of location, size, and distance. Large objects that contrast well with the surrounding environment are the best choice. Ground features on or close to track are preferred. Here's a list of some of the easiest points to spot from the air: Airports with Paved Runways: The taxiways and runways of nearby airports are easy to spot due to large clearings. They also contrast with the grass around them. Railroads: Railroads are relatively easy to spot due to large clearings made for tracks. Highways: Multi-lane highways are easy to spot from the air. Major Road Intersections: Major road and highway intersections with multiple cloverleaf turnoffs are easily spotted. Large Rivers: Looks for rivers that are drawn with some level of open-water width. Small streams are simple lines, while rivers are drawn wider on your sectional chart. Large Lakes with Definable Shapes: If a lake has an easily definable shape, it'll be easy to spot from the air. Towns with Prominent Features: Does the town you're looking for have a major road, railway, or water tower? Tall Towers or Masts: Easy to see at low level and always marked on charts due to their height, they can be excellent features for VFR navigation, as long as they aren't tall enough to hit. Power lines aren't always good as some have thin wires that don't stand out very well, but they are large features and cause large clearings to be made, which are easy to spot, particularly in a forest. Telephone lines, on the other hand, are much smaller and VERY difficult to see from high up. And, a farmland provides low contrast with the surroundings as it may be mistaken with similar field nearby.",

The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

As they are no longer on their flight planned route, following the OFP is not very useful, and the low cloud means they cannot climb higher whilst remaining VMC. When a pilot becomes in doubt about their position, they should perform some or all of the following actions: 1. Note the time. 2. Communicate, if in contact with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, to request assistance. 3. Consider using any radio-navigation aids that may be available to give position information. 4. If short of fuel or near controlled airspace and not in contact with ATC, set 121.5 MHz and make a PAN call. 5. If that is not necessary, check the directional indicator (DI) and compass are still synchronised and continue to fly straight and level and on the planned heading. 6. Estimate the distance travelled since the last known position. 7. Compare the ground with the aircraft's estimated position on the map. When the aircraft’s position is uncertain, ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. Line features such as coastlines, railways, large highways, etc. can be easy to find and useful to then fly along until you can find your position on the map. 8. Once the position has been re-established, keep checking the heading and continue the flight by updating the estimated position regularly while looking for unique features such as hills, valleys, lakes, wood, built-up areas, rivers, coastlines, motorways and railways. In any case, maintain VMC and visual contact with the ground, note the fuel state and, if necessary, try to identify an area suitable for a precautionary landing.",

Being a high obstacle over the ground in icing conditions and over an area covered by snow the high pylons will stand out cause the snow will not stack over the power line pylons. The same for high antennas which are identified on the VFR charts. The question should be clearer because it depends on the time of the year, on the conditions (if there was some snow and/or cold temperatures before, and for how long) and EASA should also mention the location. Depending on conditions and location, rivers can freeze.

So, among others, you should also consider the uniqueness and the contrast of the ground features. After examining the options given below the answer, we come to the following conclusions: The contrast of an object to its background has a notable effect on its visibility. If contrast is high (for example a valley against a hilly area), then the range at which objects can be seen is increased. A hill or a slightly steeper hillside within a hilly area does not provide uniqueness. Also, few small rivers that leave a big river may provide contrast, regarding the colours against the surrounding environment, but they are not unique. The big river at its own could be a preferable ground feature as a visual reporting point contrary to the few small rivers. Therefore, the best visual reporting point for an aircraft flying a VFR flight above a hilly area, seems to be a valley.",

Please keep sharing your feedback with each other and with us in the comments, it is always useful, especially with questions like this. We have added a table to the explanation to easily convey our current knowledge of which authorities are choosing which answer. Thanks again! Authority Reported answer Poland B UK A It seems that there might be two versions of this question, one asking why the pilot should keep his/her chart oriented to True North and the other why s/he should keep the chart oriented to True track. The correct option will differ whether it asks for True North or true track. It is advisable that the VFR chart should be lined up with the current track so that it depicts what you see outside. It is also easier to identify line features such as roads, rivers, and coastlines and track their progress along those features. This is particularly important for visual navigation, where the pilot relies on visual references to navigate, as it helps them to maintain situational awareness and stay on course. For instance, expected ground features left/right of the planned track on the chart can be spotted and identified easily on the ground. Orientation to the track direction helps the pilot to maintain situational awareness. The pilot can easily identify the location of the aircraft in relation to the surrounding terrain and navigation aids, which is essential for making safe and efficient navigation decisions. However, if the question asks the reason why the chart should be oriented to True North the correct is \"Aeronautical and topographical information can be easily read.\" If you need to read a frequency, for example, you should turn the chart to True North.",

When choosing VFR checkpoints, the following should be taken into account: Size and Distinctiveness: Favorable checkpoints exhibit considerable size, since they must be identified even when observed from a considerable distance or altitude. They should have unique features that differentiate them from other nearby object. Prominence: Checkpoints should stand out from their surroundings. They could be easily recognizable structures, geographical features, or landmarks that can be seen from a distance. Contrast with Terrain: Checkpoints should exhibit visual contrast with the surrounding terrain. This contrast can result from differences in color, texture, shape, or elevation. Proximity to Intended Path: Optimal VFR checkpoints lie directly on or in close proximity to the planned flight track, enhancing navigation accuracy. Planned Altitude Consideration: When selecting checkpoints, the intended cruising altitude must be considered. Lower altitudes might obscure a chosen reference point due to elevated terrain, or it might only become visible once the aircraft has traversed over it for a limited duration.

Based in the calculation of the position of airplane based in the direction and the ground distance traveled from a determined point. With the introduction of modern navigational techniques such as GPS and conventional radio navigational aids, this may seem outdaated technique. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with. Reference to a GPS or other navigation aid. It is likely that a route from the departure aerodrome directly to the destination will be divided into a number of route segments with the creation of turning points and waypoints. Breaking the route down into route segments brings several advantages: 1. Route segment can be selected to pass near a prominent ground feature, to help the pilot fly on track. 2. Shorter route segments minimize off-track errors by reducing the time allowed for them to develop. 3. High terrain or significant obstructions like telecommunication masts can be avoided. Really important in poor visibility conditions. Choose compact ground features as turning points and waypoints to ensure that routes are flown with precision. Large build up areas make poor turning points because of their size.",

Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station. QUJ = RBI + True Heading QTE = RBI + True Heading +180º To obtain a True Heading from the Magnetic Heading: True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 264º 12ºW 276º The relative bearing is always measured clockwise from the nose of the aircraft, 30º left is the same as RBI 330º. Aircraft’s True Bearing from the island, QTE = 330º + 264º + 180º = 774º 774º - 2 x 360º = 54º (T)",

On a Lambert conformal projection chart the great circles are straight lines exactly at the parallel of origin. When being away from the parallel of origin, they are slightly curved concave to it. In reality, the distortion of the great circles is so small that can be assumed to be straight lines. The rhumb lines are always curves concave to the pole. Route CD runs in an East-West direction. Position C lies slightly above 60°N latitude, while position D lies significantly above 60°N latitude, resulting in an average latitude of around 70°. With a significant change in longitude, the conversion angle is also substantial. Consequently, the difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle connecting positions C and D is considerable. Route GH runs in an East-West direction. As indicated in the figure, position G and H show a significant change in longitude. However, both lie slightly above 20°N latitude. Due to this small lower latitude, the conversion angle is also small, resulting in a minimal difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route GH. Route AB also travels in a nearly North-South direction. With a mean latitude of approximately 30° and a smaller change in longitude, the conversion angle remains small. Consequently, the difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route AB is also minimal, compared to Route CD. Route EF also travels in a nearly North-South direction. According to the figure, positions E is slightly above 60°N and F just over 40°N. However, despite the high mean latitude, the change in longitude for route EF is considerably small. Consequently, the conversion angle for route EF is lower than that of route CD, leading to a smaller difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle.",

Let's consider the following scenario: the positions (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) are compared to the positions (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W). It is important to note that the former positions are located at a lower latitude than the latter ones. Additionally, the change of longitude is the same in both scenarios (a 20° change in longitude). Given that the change in longitude is the same for both pairs of positions, and considering the lower latitude of (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) compared to (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W), we can infer from the provided explanation that the difference in distance between the Great Circle track and the Rhumb Line track connecting (50°S 170°E) and (50°S 170°W) will be smaller than the difference in distance between the Great Circle track and the Rhumb Line track connecting (60°S 010°E) and (60°S 010°W).

Thus, above or below the Equator, the Great Circle distance between two meridians will always be shorter than the rhumb line distance and this difference in distance will increase with latitude. Over the Earth's surface at low latitudes or over shorter distances, the rhumb line can be used for plotting the course of an aircraft. Over longer distances and/or at higher latitudes, the great circle route is significantly shorter than the rhumb line between the same two points.",

Draw in north reference arrows on the local meridians and a \"direction of travel\" arrow on the track line, as a guide when measuring the angles. Draw in the track angle at A. It can be seen that the track at A is less than 90o. If we now consider the triangle formed by point A, point B and the North Pole (NP), we have an isosceles triangle with equal sides A-NP and B-NP, thus angles NP-Â-B and NP-Â-A are equal. The angle in this triangle at NP (A-NP-B) is equal to the Change of Longitude between points A and B. They are in different hemispheres, so we add the longitudes: 160o + 130o = 290o. This is more than 180o so subtract it from 360o to find the short way around. So, Change of Longitude (A-B) = 360o - 290o = 070o. The 3 angles in any triangle always add up to 180o. Since the angle at NP is 070o, the equal angles at A and B must be 055o each (070o+055o+055o=180o). Therefore, the initial track direction at A is 055o(T).",

            "explanation": "For a Lambert chart the following convergency formula is applied: Convergency = Change of Longitude x Sin Parallel of Origin. Average true track 282.2o is the track measured exactly in the middle point between X and Y, while crossing the 25oW meridian. Parallel of origin is the mean latitude between the two standard parallels: (75o N + 30o N) / 2 = 52.5o N. Applying the rule, \"SAME HEMISPHERES, SUBTRACT\", the Change of Longitude between X and Y is: 30o W - 20o W = 10o. Thus, Convergency = 10o x sin 52,5o = 7.9o. That means that the true track from X to Y position changes by 7.9o, so until the middle point, it changes by 7.9o/2 = 3.9o. Bear in mind that both X and Y lie on the Northern hemisphere, where meridians converge inwards towards the North Pole and as we travel westwards, the true track decreases. So, true track will be greater at X than in the middle point and consequently greater in the middle point than at Y. The direction at position X is: 282.2o + 3.9o = 286,1o and The direction at position Y is: 282.2o - 3.9o = 278.3o. Therefore, the correct answer is that the approximate direction is 286o at position X.",

            "explanation": "Polar Stereographic chart projection assumes that a flat plane touches at the Pole, with the origin of the projection at the opposite pole. The tangential point of a Polar Stereographic chart is the pole. The Meridians are straight lines radiating from the pole, cutting the parallels of latitude at right angles and the Parallels of latitude are concentric circles and their distance apart increases away from the pole. On a Polar Stereographic chart, the great circles at the tangential point would be straight lines, but since it is a point, you cannot draw a great circle there. The great circles that cut through the pole (tangential point) will also be straight lines, these are the meridians. Elsewhere, the great circles will actually be slightly curved concave to the pole on the Polar side, but near the pole can be assumed to be straight lines. Therefore, for the great circles on a Polar Stereographic chart: \"The higher their latitude (the closer to the Pole), The less their curvature\". Route CD follows a nearly North-South direction. The figure indicates a mean latitude of approximately 70º and a small change in longitude. Due to this small change in longitude, the conversion angle is also small, resulting in a minimal difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route CD. Route AB also travels in a nearly North-South direction. With a mean latitude of approximately 70º and a small change in longitude, the conversion angle remains small. Consequently, the difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle for route AB is also minimal. Route EF also travels in an East-West direction. According to the figure, both positions E and F are situated at latitudes exceeding 80º, implying a mean latitude higher than 80º. However, despite the high mean latitude, the change in longitude for route EF is considerably less compared to route GH. Consequently, the conversion angle for route EF is lower than that of route GH, leading to a smaller difference between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle. Route GH runs in an East-West direction. As indicated in the figure, position G lies slightly above 60ºN latitude, while position H lies slightly below 60ºN latitude, resulting in an average latitude of around 60º. With a significant change in longitude, the conversion angle is also substantial. Consequently, the disparity between the Rhumb Line and the Great Circle connecting positions G and H is considerable.",

In this diagram, you can see that the RLT has a larger track angle than the initial GCT of 67⁰.

Any circle that is not a great circle is called a small circle, also known as parallel of latitudes.

The track direction change from A to B is given by the convergency formula: Convergency = Change of Longitude x Sin mean latitude = (70o-60o) x sin 60o= 8.6o. The angle between the great circle and the rhumb line track is the conversion angle, which is half the convergency: Conversion angle = 8.7o/2 = 4.3o. So, the Great Circle Track at A is: 270o+4.3o = 274.3o. And the Great Circle Track at B is: 270o - 4.3o = 265.7o. The 64th meridian is between A and B, therefore the Great Circle track at 64th meridian will be between 274.3o and 265.7o. The only option that could be a Great Circle Track when passing the 64th meridian is 270.8o. Alternatively, to get to the exact value, we must calculate the convergency between A and meridian 064ºW: Convergency = Change of Longitude x Sin mean latitude = (64o-60o) x sin 60o Convergency = 4º x sin 60º = 3.46º The DIID diagram, which shows an decreasing track as we travel in a westerly direction in the northern hemisphere (top half) - \"D\" is for decreasing.

After that, draw the local meridians 130°E and 130°W through positions A and B and the track joining them. Draw in north reference arrows on the local meridians and a \"direction of travel\" arrow on the track line, as a guide when measuring the angles. Draw in the track angle at A. It can be seen that the track at A is less than 90o. If we now consider the triangle formed by point A, point B and the North Pole (NP), we have an isosceles triangle with equal sides A-NP and B-NP, thus angles NP-Â-B and NP-Â-A are equal. The angle in this triangle at NP (A-NP-B) is equal to the Change of Longitude between points A and B. They are in different hemispheres, so we add the longitudes: 130o + 130o = 260o. This is more than 180o so subtract it from 360o to find the short way around. So, Change of Longitude (A-B) = 360o - 260o = 100o. The 3 angles in any triangle always add up to 180o. Since the angle at NP is 100o, the equal angles at A and B must be 040o each (100o+040o+040o=180o). Therefore, the initial track direction at A is 040o(T).",

Chart Scale = Chart length / Earth distance On a Mercator chart, scale expands away from the Equator. The scale expansion is proportional to the secant of the latitude. Questions about scale in a Mercator chart, come in 1 of 4 basic types: Given scale at the Equator, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find scale at the Equator. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given a fixed chart distance between meridians, find Mercator scale at a specific latitude. The equation to remember to solve this questions is the following one: Scale denominator A x cos (Latitude B) = Scale denominator B x cos (Latitude A) You could use this formula, but you would come that the relation between the distances and the scale is a constant. Manipulating the formula we came out with this: Departure at A x cos (Latitude B) = Departure at B x cos (Latitude A) Departure at B = 120 x cos (10º) / cos (15º) = 122,3 nm",

On a Lamberts Conformal Conical chart this is the point where the external cone forms the tangent and this parallel of latitude is known as the Parallel of Origin. In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. The Scale in Lambert conformal chart is only correct along the standard parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels. The Parallel of Origin determines the Convergence Factor for the whole chart and is equal to the Sine of this latitude, i.e. the Sine of the Parallel of Origin. The Convergence Factor is also known (on a Lamberts Chart) as the 'Constant of the Cone' or simply 'n'. Convergency: Angular difference between the initial track and final track. Conversion angle: Angular difference between initial track and rhumb line.",

Angle at B = 82º. Therefore, True bearing from position B to position A = 360º - 82º = 278º",

            "explanation": "The true course along the straight-line track at position A is 060° True (in a north-easterly direction, where Point B is closer to the North compared to Point A). This track extends from a higher latitude (48º) to a lower latitude (36º), which indicates that it is located in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, a track between these latitudes would generally be oriented in a southerly direction. Now, we can exclude two options (Northern Hemisphere answers), leaving us with two remaining choices: Southern Hemisphere, 166°E Southern Hemisphere, 176°E To determine the correct option, we first need to calculate the change in longitude. The question specifies that \"Chart Convergency = Earth Convergency at latitude 42°.\" On a Lambert chart, the Chart Convergence is only equal to Earth Convergence at the Parallel of Origin, which means that the Parallel of Origin is at 42ºS. The track at Point A is 060ºT, and at Point B, it is 046ºT. The convergency between these two tracks is calculated as follows: Convergency = 060ºT - 046ºT = 014º Using the relationship Convergency = Change of Longitude x sin (Parallel of Origin), we can solve for Change of Longitude: Change of Longitude = Convergency / sin (Parallel of Origin) Change of Longitude = 014º / 0.669 Change of Longitude = 021º Point B is situated to the east of Point A, and the Change of Longitude between the two positions is 21°, the Longitude of Point B is determined as follows: Longitude of Point B = Longitude A + Change of Longitude Longitude of Point B = 155°E + 021° = 176°E",

Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart.

Parallel of origin is the mean latitude between the two standard parallels: (75o N + 30o N) / 2 = 52.5o N. Applying the rule, \"SAME HEMISPHERES - SUBTRACT\", the Change of Longitude between X and Y is: 40o W - 30o W = 10o. Thus, Convergency = 10o x sin 52,5o = 7.9o. That means that the true track from X to Y position changes by 7.9o, so until the middle point, it changes by: 7.9o/2 = 4o rounded. Bear in mind that both X and Y lie on the Northern hemisphere, where meridians converge inwards towards the North Pole and as we travel eastwards and at a higher latitude, the true track increases. So, true track will be lower at X than in the middle point and consequently lower in the middle point than at Y. The direction at position X is: 080o - 4o = 76o and The direction at position Y is: 080o + 4o = 84o. Therefore, the correct answer is that the direction of the straight line at position X is 076º.",

Using a ruler, measure the distance corresponding to 1º of latitude on the chart (60NM) and compare that distance to the plotted line length: approx. 111 NM. (3) Determine the initial true track: The easiest and fastest way is to use a protractor. Place the protractor over the BEL VOR/DME and match the radials on the map with the degrees on the protractor (it is as if the protractor was aligned with Magnetic North). You can see on the protractor at which degree the line aligns to => 067ºM Since we are asked for the initial true track and radials are magnetic tracks, we must apply variation. The variation is identified by a dashed line to the west of belfast: 4ºW Variation West, Magnetic Best. Initial true track (ºT) = 067º - 4º = 063ºT Alternatively, From BEL VOR, draw a line parallel to the nearest meridian. This line will now represent True North. We can then measure the angle between the True North reference and the plotted line connecting BEL VOR/DME to TLA VOR DME.",

Add relative bearing to true heading in order to get true bearing TO the station If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station. QUJ = RBI + True Heading QTE = RBI + True Heading - 180º To obtain a True Heading from the Magnetic Heading: Bearings measured at ground station (VOR, VDF) - variation at ground station Bearings measured at aircraft (NDB/ADF, AWR) - variation at aircraft True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 191º 6ºE 185º The exercise is asking us for a true bearing from the beacon to the aircraft (QTE): QUJ= 65º + 191º = 256º QTE = 65º + 191º - 180º = 76º Unlike the Mercator chart where chart convergence is zero, in a Lambert conformal chart the meridians merge with each other at the poles. To plot a bearing in a Lambert chart we must apply the chart convergence, because there is chart convergence between the meridians where the bearing is measured (aircraft) and from it will be plotted (NDB). If you plot the true bearing of the NDB from the aircraft 256º, in a Lambert char the plot will be correct. The problem is when you need to plot the reciprocal from the meridian of the NDB, the line will not pass through the aircraft position, If the angle of 076º is measured from a line that is parallel to the aircraft meridian drawn to the NDB, the position line will pass trough the aircraft like in figure (b). When drawing the line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian, chart convergence as been automatically allowed. Figure (b) show as that the reciprocal of of 256º will have an angular value lower than 076º, that difference will be the chart convergence of 8º. Bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 076º - 8º = 068º NOTE: The drawing the bearings are 270º and 090º that will correspond to 256º and 076º.",

The radial 093o is a magnetic bearing and the TRENT (TNT) VOR/DME is between isogonals 2oW and 1oW, but closer to the 2oW. So, the true bearing from the TRENT (TNT) VOR/DME is: 093oM - 2oW = 091o T. Center your plotter at TRENT (TNT) VOR/DME symbol. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s true meridians and the course arrow indicating 091o T. Draw a line along the bearing 091o T and equal to 4 6/8 inches length. The coordinates at the end of the drawn line are 52°59'N, 000°20'E.",

In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. The Scale in Lambert conformal chart is only correct along the standard parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels.

The chart scale depicts the relationship between the length represented on the chart and the actual distance on planet Earth (departure): Chart Scale = Chart length / Earth distance The provided coordinates indicate that both positions are situated on the 53°N parallel of latitude, forming a rhumb line. To calculate the Earth distance between these points along the 53°N parallel (rhumb line), the departure can be used: Departure = Change of longitude (minutes) x 60 x cos (latitude) Departure = 10 x 60 x cos (53º) = 361.09 NM or 361.09 x 1.852 x 100 000 cm The scale of the Lambert chart at latitude 53°N is 1:1 234 000 (1 cm on the chart equals 1 234 000 cm on the Earth). Therefore, we can determine the Earth distance as follows: A distance of 1 cm on the chart corresponds to a distance of 1 234 000 cm on Earth. A distance of x cm on the chart represents a distance of 361.09 x 1.852 x 100 000 cm on the Earth. x = (361.09 x 1.852 x 100 000) ÷ 1 234 000 x = 54.19 cm The scale is contracted within the standard parallels, therefore the scale at 53°N latitude is smaller than the Lambert chart's scale (1:1 234 000), meaning the scale at 53°N has a denominator greater than 1 234 000. Consequently, the Earth distance will be represented on the chart by a distance less than 54.19 cm.",

The Meridians are straight lines radiating from the pole, cutting the parallels of latitude at right angles and the Parallels of latitude are concentric circles and their distance apart increases away from the pole. On a Polar Stereographic chart, the great circles at the tangential point would be straight lines, but since it is a point, you cannot draw a great circle there. The great circles that cut through the pole (tangential point) will also be straight lines, these are the meridians. Elsewhere, the great circles will actually be slightly curved concave to the pole on the Polar side, but near the pole can be assumed to be straight lines. Therefore, for the great circles on a Polar Stereographic chart: \"The higher their latitude (the closer to the Pole), The less their curvature\".",

Initially, we must use the chart to calculate the magnetic variation, and by interpolating for the point of 74ºN, 15ºE between isogonals of 5ºE and 10ºE, we get a magnetic variation of 7ºE. Using the rhyme, \"Variation West, Magnetic Best Variation East, Magnetic Least\", we can see that the initial great circle track (GCT) from the aircraft's position is 064º(T). Then by using either a DIDI diagram or the diagram shown above, we can calculate the effect of convergency on the great circle track. Convergency = Change of longitude x sin(mean latitude) The mean latitude is approximately 74º15'. The change of longitude is very close to 4º, so we can use that value. Convergency = 4 x sin(74º15') = 3.85º, for ease of calculations we can call this 4º convergency. This means that the final great circle track (GCT) from the aircraft's position to the \"BJO\" NDB is 4º greater (the direction of change is found by using the chart above or a DIDI diagram) than the initial GCT, so the final GCT is 068º(T). This means the initial GCT for the opposite track (from the NDB to the aircraft) is just the inverse (+/- 180º) of 068º, and the answer is therefore 248º(T).",

Bearings measured at ground station (VOR, VDF) - variation at ground station Bearings measured at aircraft (NDB/ADF, AWR) - variation at aircraft True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 191° 6°E 185° Add relative bearing to true heading in order to get true bearing TO the station. If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station. QUJ = RBI + True Heading QTE = RBI + True Heading - 180° The exercise is asking us for a true bearing from the beacon to the aircraft (QTE): QUJ= 65° + 191° = 256° QTE = 65° + 191° - 180° = 76° Now to apply the convergency. The chart convergence here means that we can not just plot the reciprocal heading from an NDB, as this would give us a false position, as We have to account for the 8° convergency, and to work out how to do this, the best way is often to use a diagram like the one above, and note that the red angle is smaller at the NDB than the same angle would be at the aircraft, so therefore the red angle is 8° smaller than the reciprocal bearing of 076°. This can also be done without drawing if you are adept at using the DIID method, but be careful, that way is much easier to make a mistake. True bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 076° - 8° = 068°",

Flying a radial to/from a VOR or bearing to/from an NDB will be always a Great Circle track. The GCT from the VOR will be the same as the radial from the VOR, we know that Convergency is change in direction of the GCT: Convergency = Change in Longitude × Sine (Mean Latitude) Convergency = (10º - 005º42’) x sin ((56º+55º26´)/2) = 3,55º With reference to the D-I-I-D scheme, flying easterly in the Northern Hemisphere, the angular value of the GCT will increase: GCT VOR= 101,5º + 3,55º = 105º(T) The exercise is asking magnetic bearing from the VOR, the reciprocal is 105º + 180º = 285º(T). A radial is always magnetic, a True direction must be converted to Magnetic. Bearings measured at ground station (VOR, VDF) - variation at ground station Bearings measured at aircraft (NDB/ADF, AWR) - variation at aircraft True bearing (T) Variation (V) Magnetic bearing (M) Deviation (D) Compass direction (C) 285º 09ºW 294º",

On a Lamberts Conformal Conical chart this is the point where the external cone forms the tangent and this parallel of latitude is known as the Parallel of Origin. In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels. The Parallel of Origin determines the Convergence Factor for the whole chart and is equal to the Sine of this latitude, i.e. the Sine of the Parallel of Origin. The Convergence Factor is also known (on a Lamberts Chart) as the 'Constant of the Cone' or simply 'n'. The equation for convergency is: Convergency = Change of Longitude x Convergence Factor Correct Answer: depends on the latitude of the parallel of origin and on difference n longitude f two positions.",

During short routes, the difference in distance between rhumb lines and great circles are almost unnoticeable. Convergency also changes with the \"Sin Mean Latitude\", which means that in the vicinity of the equator convergency will be the least (convergency at the equator = 0).

Firstly, find the exact position of MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME and CLYDE points on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME, since the question asks for the initial track from MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the Initial True Track from MACHRIHANISH (MAC) DME: 042o. Apply the variation 004oW (the track is closer to 004oW isogonal than to 003oW) on the true track to get the magnetic one: 042o + 4o = 046o (Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between the two points is 213/16 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 43 NM.",

Chart Scale = Chart length / Earth distance On a Mercator chart, scale expands away from the Equator. The scale expansion is proportional to the secant of the latitude. Questions about scale in a Mercator chart, come in 1 of 4 basic types: Given scale at the Equator, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find scale at the Equator. Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find Mercator scale at some other latitude. Given a fixed chart distance between meridians, find Mercator scale at a specific latitude. The equation to remember to solve this questions is the following one: Scale denominator A x cos (Latitude B) = Scale denominator B x cos (Latitude A) You could use this formula, but you would come that the relation between the distances and the scale is a constant. Manipulating the formula we came out with this: Departure at A x cos (Latitude B) = Departure at B x cos (Latitude A) Departure at B = 70 x cos (30º) / cos (45º) = 86 nm",

Near the parallel of origin, they appear nearly straight. At any other latitude, Great Circle tracks take on a curved shape that is concave towards the parallel of origin. For Rhumb Lines: Meridians are shown as straight lines. All other Rhumb Lines are concave toward the pole. This curvature is particularly noticeable in parallels of latitude. In the context of this Lambert chart, the standard parallels are 65ºN and 37ºN. The Parallel of Origin falls between these standard parallels, approximately at 51ºN. Consequently, when drawing a straight-line track from 49ºN 030ºW to 48ºN 040ºW, this track will be positioned south of the Parallel of Origin. The Great Circle track between these points will exhibit concavity toward the Parallel of Origin, which means it will be positioned south of the straight-line track. Similarly, the Rhumb Line Track will also show concavity towards the nearer pole and will lie on the equatorial side of the Great Circle Track. Therefore, it will be situated to the south of the Great Circle Track.",

NOTE: QDM is the reciprocal of QDR; QUJ is the reciprocal of QTE. Converting a Relative Bearing (RBI) into a True Bearing: Apply aircraft variation to the magnetic heading to get true heading. Add relative bearing to true heading in order to obtain true bearing TO the station If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360. Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the station. QUJ = RBI + True Heading QTE = RBI + True Heading +180º To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 037º 16ºW 053º 2ºE 051º Aircraft’s True Track from the feature, QTE = 060º + 037º + 180º = 277º (T) Unlike the Mercator chart where chart convergence is zero, in a Lambert conformal chart the meridians merge with each other at the poles. To plot a bearing in a Lambert chart we must apply the chart convergence, because there is chart convergence between the meridians where the bearing is measured (aircraft) and from it will be plotted (NDB). If you plot the true bearing of the NDB from the aircraft 097º, in a Lambert char the plot will be correct. The problem is when you need to plot the reciprocal from the meridian of the NDB, the line will not pass through the aircraft position. When drawing the line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian, chart convergence as been automatically allowed. Chart convergence = ch.long × sin parallel of origin Chart convergence = (006º00’- 004º45’) x sin ((65+37)/2) = 1º The reciprocal of 097º will have an angular value higher than 277º, that difference will be the chart convergence of 1º If the angle of 278º is measured from a line that is parallel to the aircraft meridian drawn to the NDB, the position line will pass trough the aircraft. Bearing to be plotted from the NDB to the aircraft = 277º + 1º = 278º",

Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, and what you remember from it, so we can make it as close to the real exam question as possible, thank you. On this zoomed in section of the ED-4 chart, there is only 1 obstacle indicated, with an elevation that corresponds with any of the answers. It is important to note that any AGL heights on the chart for obstacles are only added when the obstacle is over 1000 ft tall (AGL), and is added in brackets next to the elevation AMSL. 2 416 ft AMSL This is the correct answer, the wind turbine(s) just East of Freiburg have an elevation of 2 416 ft at their highest point. This elevation is the top of a turbine, so above the ground level, and would therefore have a height AGL (that is not 0 ft). We do not know the height AGL as the turbines must be less than 1000 ft tall. 2 418 ft AGL This point does not exist. The \"2418\" under the wind turbine on the chart is a spot height of terrain elevation, and would therefore mean that the terrain there reaches a highest point of 2 418 ft AMSL. 2 841 ft Again, this is a spot height of terrain elevation, East of the wind turbine. It is therefore not an \"obstacle\", it is only terrain, and would not have a height AGL (as it is the ground level). 1296 ft AGL or 2746 ft AMSL These two elevations are actually different spot heights of terrain elevation, so are not correct.",

Measure an angle of 12° clockwise from GOW 154° radial and make a pencil mark. Draw a line connecting GOW VOR with the pencil mark, representing the GOW 166° radial. Radials can also be drawn using protractor and ruler, by lining up the protractor with the numbered radials (so magnetic tracks are being used) and then drawing a line outwards from the point on the radial track, using a ruler. Either way works just fine, and depends on the equipment you have to hand. Finally, locate the point of intersection of the two lines (radials) drawn, which indicates the position of the aircraft: N55º17', W004º08'.",

On a Lamberts Conformal Conical chart this is the point where the external cone forms the tangent and this parallel of latitude is known as the Parallel of Origin. In effect, the Lamberts chart is constructed from a secant cone which is placed inside the Earth - as such it intersects the Earth surface at two points, known as Standard Parallels. The Scale in Lambert conformal chart is only correct along the standard parallels. Part of the chart (outside the Standard Parallels) is outside the Earth and part (inside the Standard Parallels) is inside the Earth. The Parallel of Origin (from the outer cone) is mathematically projected onto this inner cone and is located slightly poleward of the mid-point of the Standard Parallels; however, for simplicity we assume the Parallel of Origin is half-way between the Standard Parallels, i.e. the average of the Standard Parallels. The Parallel of Origin determines the Convergence Factor for the whole chart and is equal to the Sine of this latitude, i.e. the Sine of the Parallel of Origin.",
