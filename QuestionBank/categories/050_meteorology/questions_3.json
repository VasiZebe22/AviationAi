            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.01.01.02.04: Describe the variations of the FL and temperature of the tropopause from the poles to the equator. The atmosphere is split up into many different layers. The lowest layer is the troposphere, followed by the stratosphere. In general, these are the two that pilots care about most. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, and is where the stratosphere begins. The atmosphere is not always the same height though, in fact it varies wildly in height between the tropics and the poles. Over the equator, the atmosphere is very tall, due to both heat (meaning that pressure reduces at a lower rate with altitude) and other effects such as convection and general circulation of air. The atmosphere over the poles has much less height, this is mostly to do with the reduced convection and the cold air, which loses pressure more quickly with altitude. The height of the troposphere (which is indicative of the atmosphere in general) will therefore change from season to season, as solar heating differs due to the angle of the sun to the ground. In the winter season, in general a hemisphere will have a lower tropopause, and in the summer, a higher tropopause. This also coincides with how close a particular place is to the ITCZ, the heat equator, which moves with the seasons. In the tropics, the tropopause reaches around FL550 in summer, dropping a little in the winter, depending on where in the tropics. At the poles, it can drop to as low as FL200 around the winter time, and up to around FL250 in the summer. The ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) has the tropopause at 36 090 ft, which is a good average for areas at 40-50º Latitude (above this in summer, below it in winter). Therefore FL250 to FL350 sounds plausible for 55º N, which equates to the South of Scotland, or around the latitude of Denmark. Note: You only need a rough idea of tropopause heights for this question (especially as two answers can be removed for having higher winter heights than summer heights, which is not correct) and the learning objective above is vague, but does not require memorizing a table or any such deep knowledge.",

Terrestrial Radiation The Earth radiates energy into the atmosphere in the form of terrestrial radiation. It is more readily absorbed by the atmosphere especially by clouds, water vapour and carbon dioxide that solar radiation due to its longer wavelength. The absorption of heat by the atmosphere from the Earth is the main heat exchange mechanism that causes weather. Any terrestrial radiation not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere escapes back into space. SUMMARY Insolation: sun warms the Earth; Radiation: Earth loses heat, radiates heat. During the day, insolation predominates over radiation; hence Earth gets warmer. At night, radiation predominates; Earth cools down. On the average, however, (within a year) insolation and radiation are approximately in balance but it fluctuates during a year (seasonal).",

Learning Objective 050.01.02.06.01: Explain the cooling/warming of the surface of the Earth by radiation. Insolation The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. Therefore, for this question, the short-wave radiation from The Sun heats the Earth, and the Earth loses it's heat through long-wave radiation (amongst other forms of heat loss).",

As a result, temperatures decrease more slowly than if the skies were clear. During the day, the earth is heated by the sun. If skies are clear, more heat reaches the earth's surface. This leads to warmer temperatures. However, if skies are cloudy, some of the sun's rays are reflected off the cloud droplets back into space. Therefore, less of the sun's energy is able to reach the earth's surface, which causes the earth to heat up more slowly. This leads to cooler temperatures.",

Because of this the QFE will be measured 50 feet below sea level, the QNH will still be measured at sea level which is 50 feet higher.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This is also what allows the transition level to be a lower value than the transition altitude; FL45 is actually higher than 5000 ft on the QNH. The pressure correction is 30 ft/hPa. Alternatively, you can consider the direction of this pressure/altitude readout change by saying the pilot must increase the subscale setting, so therefore the reading on the altimeter will increase. Pressure Difference = 1043 - 1013 = 30 hPa Pressure Correction = 30 x 30 = 900 ft Indicated altitude = 4 500 + 900 = 5 400 ft",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). The average height of the tropopause over the equator is around 16 km (max 20km) and the temperature is around -80 °C.",

The tropopause height varies with latitude and season - and it is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. - The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause. The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C. Calculating the average tropopause height (ft): Tropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280 for winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result. Latitude is given by the question: 60ºN Tropopause height = (16 x cos 60º) x 3280 = 26 240 ft Overhead the sea, it is usually warmer. Therefore, we would have to choose the next higher value. From available options, 20 000 ft would be too low. Best option: 29 000 ft. Note: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value. Normally around 60º latitudes tropopause is between 25 0000 and 30 000 ft.",

Given an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 500/1000) = -270 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude. Therefore, we subtract the temperature correction from the indicated altitude according to the rules, resulting in a true height of 4 230 ft (4 500 ft – 270 ft).",

The flight is performed maintaining a constant Indicated Altitude of 6 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1012 hPa (and that is all we need from Point A - elevation is irrelevant). In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 977 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1012 hPa - 977 hPa = 35 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 35 hPa x 27 ft = 945 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 6500 ft - 945 ft = 5555 ft The elevation at B is 930 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 5555 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 5555 ft - 930 ft = 4625 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 977 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 930 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1012 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 930 ft + 945 ft = 1875 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 6500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1012). We need to climb 6500 ft - 1875 ft = 4625 ft (which is our height over the surface). Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Conduction involves the transfer of heat through molecular contact and influences the temperature of the air directly in contact with the Earth's surface. However, its impact diminishes with altitude due to air's poor conductivity. Convection occurs as the surface heats the air above, causing it to rise due to decreased density. This vertical movement is a key mechanism for transferring heat upwards, leading to cloud formation and further warming through latent heat release. Turbulent mixing aids in horizontal air mass movement and heat distribution within the atmosphere, but its role in vertical heat transfer is less significant compared to convection. Radiation is crucial, with the Earth's surface absorbing solar radiation and emitting it as longwave radiation, warming the air above. In summary, convection and radiation are the dominant processes that transfer heat from the Earth's surface to the higher levels of the troposphere. While conduction's impact is limited vertically, and turbulent mixing primarily affects horizontal heat transfer. Therefore, conduction and turbulence predominantly contribute to heat transfer to the lower levels of the atmosphere.",

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 000/1000) = -240 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­3 760 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Adjusting the altimeter's sub-scale setting changes the altitude reading. Decreasing the sub-scale value (setting a lower pressure) will cause the altimeter to show a lower altitude. This happens because a lower pressure setting moves the reference level closer to your vertical position, and vice versa. For example, changing the sub-scale setting from 1030 hPa to 1010 hPa will lower the altimeter reading, as the distance between the aircraft and the 1010 hPa pressure level is less than the distance to the 1030 hPa level. When flying from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the actual altitude decreases while the indicated altitude remains the same. This discrepancy causes the altimeter to over-read the aircraft's true altitude. Flying from high pressure to low pressure: actual altitude < indicated altitude (QNH) Flying from low pressure to high pressure: actual altitude > indicated altitude (QNH) With the altimeter set to a QNH of 1030 hPa, if the indicated altitude is 8500 ft, but the local QNH is actually 1010 hPa (20 hPa lower), maintaining a QNH of 1030 hPa would mean the true altitude (based on a QNH of 1010 hPA) of the aircraft is lower than the indicated altitude by: 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft Therefore, ⇒ True altitude = 8 500 ft - 600 ft = 7 900 ft",

Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. When we move from south to north in the Northern Hemisphere we move from the equator to the poles. The temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the height of the tropopause decrease.",

Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

To solve this question, all we need to do is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­594 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 3 600 ft - 594 = 3 006 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (15 000/1 000) = -900 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­15 900 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 900 ft + 300 ft = 16 200 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the left, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from high pressure to low pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually decrease. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the left, the aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation, to get the indicated altitude (with local QNH set). To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15°C, and the temperature lapse rate is -2°C/1000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15°C - (6500/1000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2°C. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-9°C, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -11°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-11) × (6500/1000) = -286 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­6786 ft. RULES.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 979 hPa = 34 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 34 ft x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 020 ft.

In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft.

The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 773 ft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude of 36 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-2ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -17ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 5 860 ft - 36 ft = 5 824 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (5 824/1000) = -396 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­6 256 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 972 hPa = 41 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 41 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 1 230 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 256 ft + 1 230 ft = 7 486 ft. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL75. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

An airport at sea level has an approach with a DA of 3 500 ft (way higher than usual due to the terrain), and must be temperature corrected when the OAT is below -5ºC; the current OAT is -10ºC, calculate the corrected DA. Cold temperature corrections exist because barometric altimeters are calibrated for ISA conditions, and when the air column is colder than ISA, the pressure drops faster with altitude, and the altimeter will over-read. This over-reading makes the pilot think they are higher than they actually are, so reduces terrain clearance. This means that cold temperature corrections are additions to the altitudes we fly, so we know we are actually at the intended true altitude, even with an over-reading altimeter. The cold temperature correction is made from ISA to the actual OAT, and can either be done using a table, or using a calculation as follows: To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

When setting the local QNH of 1003 hPa, we will be decreasing the subscale setting from 1013 hPa to 1003 hPa => our altimeter reading will decrease from 15 000 ft (or FL150) to 15 000 ft - (10 hPa x 40 ft/hPa) 14 600 ft. Therefore, the gap between 14 600 ft and 13 000 ft = 1 600 ft. Alternatively, you can use the following method: TA = 13 000 ft TL = 15 000 ft Which results in a 2 000 ft difference.

The pressure altitude and the true altitude will be equal only when standard atmospheric conditions exist, i.e. there is no temperature deviation from ISA and the pressure at sea level is 1013 hPa. To calculate the pressure adjustment, we apply the correction of 30 ft for each 1 hPa difference between QNH and 1013 hPa. Thus, if the actual QNH (pressure) in the area we are flying over is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude. If the QNH (pressure) is higher than 1013 hPa, the true altitude is higher than the indicated altitude.

The pressure does not change accurately with height when the atmosphere is not the same as the ISA though.

The outside air temperature decreases by 10ºC, so if the pilot continues flying the aircraft at an indicated altitude of 2000 ft on their altimeter, their true altitude will decrease due to the colder air. To determine the altitude correction, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Altitude correction for the temp = 4 × (temperature difference) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft So for this case then, the true altitude decrease is 4 x 10 x (2000/1000) = 80 ft Correct answer = -80 ft.",

As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic. In the Northern Hemisphere, the wind will back and slackens off as you descend to the surface due to the friction effect. In other words, in the Northern hemisphere, frictional retardation causes veering of the airflow during climb out through the lower boundary layer (2000-3000 ft). In the Southern Hemisphere, the wind veers and slackens off as you descend to the surface.

Mountain waves are very violent updrafts and downdrafts that occcur above, and downstream of, mountain ranges. In particular, the area insde and underneath a lenticular cloud contains extremely violent rotor turbulence effects, and should never be flown close to. When at only 1 500 ft above the maximum terrain elevation, the downdrafts from these mountain waves could easily overpower a piston aircraft's maximum rate of climb, causing potential terrain clearance issues also. Another problem with mountain waves is that they can, in the right conditions, continue upwards for tens of thousands of feet, up as high as the tropopause in some cases. This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case. Sometimes the lenticular clouds will form in higher mountain wave layers, stacking up; sometimes they will not. If there are lenticular clouds around 9500ft, there will almost certainly be a lot of turbulence around 11,500ft also. If you were to go a few more miles East, you would be out of the mountain range area. This is not an excessive diversion to make, and so could be completed safely. If this was not possible, then turning back would be the best course of action.",

Wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF), from high to low pressure. 2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces). GEOSTROPHIC WIND: Occurs above the friction layer. Occurs at a latitude greater than 15 degrees. Occurs when the isobars are straight, parallel and equidistant (constant gradient). Occurs when the pressure situation is not changing rapidly (constant gradient/equidistant).",

The latter is now more dominant, and the surface wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind. The relationship between isobar spacing and pressure gradient is that the closer the isobar spacing (strong/steep pressure gradient), the stronger the pressure gradient, thus the stronger the wind. The spacing between isobars represents a pressure differential between those two isobars. When two isobars are closer together, the pressure changes at a greater rate over distance. When isobars are spaced far apart (weak/shallow pressure gradient), the pressure changes more gradually over distance and thus the wind speed is weaker. Therefore, we can conclude that surface winds with isobars closed together – result in strong winds blowing across the isobars at an angle, towards the LOW.",

To conclude, on the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side we will see clear turbulent conditions. As the air makes its leeward descent, it is compressed and warms rapidly all the way downslope – because there is little water left to evaporate. Thus, the air is warmer and drier when it reaches the leeward slope than when it begins its windward ascent. Initially, the air warms at the SALR, since some moisture will be lost on the windward side, the warming of the descending air at SALR will be shorter - the air becomes unsaturated at a lower temperature (higher altitude) than the original dew point. Thus, the cloud base on the leeward side will be higher than the cloud base on the windward side which is at 2 000 ft.",

In the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. This is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense, from approximately 280° to approximately 230°. The isobars are also closer together after the second cold front, meaning that the wind speed is higher in this region, and therefore the wind gets faster after passing through the cold front.",

Free cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside. An anabatic wind is a light wind of around 5 kt. A katabatic wind is caused by a ﬂow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night, when the highlands radiate heat and are cooled. The air in contact with the higher-level ground is also cooled, and it becomes denser than the air at the same elevation but away from the slope; it, therefore, begins to flow downhill. The katabatic eﬀect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the ﬂow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form.",

            "explanation": "Some information is missing in this question. We lack clarity on whether this scenario unfolds in the Southern or Northern Hemisphere, which means that we do not know whether the wind backs or veers. However, we do know it's over the sea, indicating a speed reduction of 70%. Given a \"2000 ft wind\" of 80 knots, we can anticipate the surface wind to be 56 kt. Furthermore, the direction is expected to be 10° different. As mentioned above, we do not know the hemisphere, therefore we are unable to determine the exact wind direction. Closest option: 330° / 65 kt Further information: The geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the free stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind). Surface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also changed in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force. This means that in the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is \"backed\" from the free stream wind, to go towards the low pressure (and it is \"veered\" in the Southern Hemisphere). The degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on the surface type (its friction) and the time of day (amount of vertical mixing): Day Night Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Land 30° 50% 40° 30% Sea 10° 70% 10° 70%",

The extent of the friction layer increases as the amount of solar radiation increases. During the day, the surface of the Earth heats up because of solar radiation. In warmer air, the vertical movement of the air parcels intensifies. This means that the warm air mixes in a thicker layer than in colder air. Due to the intensive mixing processes, convective turbulence can often be expected on warm days. At night, the extent of the friction layer decreases as the surface of the Earth cools. Consequently, the intensity of the convection and the surface wind decreases Its minimum value is to be observed around sunrise. Note: Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 h on clear sunny days (when the highest temperatures are reached) - In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.",

The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

Clear air turbulence (CAT) is remarkably difficult to detect (unless you are within it), as no radar returns will ever show it. Both airborne weather radar and ground weather radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot, but not for CAT, as there are no such visible particles to give returns. Satellites are very similar, they cannot detect it as it is effectively invisible to their sensors. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft (EASA like to ask questions about this), as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is quite a lot of educated guesswork, giving very wide areas of possible CAT, and it can also appear in unexpected places with no warning.",

Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Southern Hemisphere is the other way around: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. In the case of this specific question: The question states that we are flying in the Northern Hemisphere, so if we stand with our back into the wind, the low-pressure area is on our left-hand side. Since we have a wind from the left, (and we imagine ourselves standing with our back into the wind, so with our face pointing east) we must be flying from a high to a low-pressure area. If the pressure in an area changes, we have to think about what consequence this has on our flight. Since we fly on a Flight level (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But our actual flight level will. Because the altimeter is only accurate in the Standard Atmosphere and we now are experiencing a lower actual pressure, the altimeter will over read. The actual altitude will be lower, so true altitude decreases.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.02.05.01.05: Describe that mountain wave effects can exceed the performance or structural capability of aircraft. Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Whilst the wind is relatively smooth in general, there is a significant amount of windshear, causing heavy turbulence and rotor effects underneath the peaks of the wave. Mountain waves are not just at the height of the mountain peaks though, as they affect the air above themselves also, and, given the right conditions, can propagate as high as the tropopause. Lenticular clouds indicate the presence of mountain waves, and even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near, due to the effects mentioned above. That being said, not all mountain waves have lenticular clouds, so it is important to be careful of them when downwind of any mountain range with the correct conditions.",

Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force. The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. This makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more. The outflow of air from a high is called divergence. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days. The inflow of air into a low is called convergence. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather. In this question, they are asking about the atmospheric divergence from a high pressure zone. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel across the isobars and away from the high pressure area, towards the low.",

In the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the cold front about halfway through the route, this is a change in direction in the clockwise sense (known as \"veering\"), from approximately 230° (SW) to approximately 280°(NW). The isobars are also closer together before we reach the cold front, meaning that the wind speed is higher in this region (the warm sector), and therefore the wind speed decreases after passing through the cold front. The cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front). This means that we are travelling directly opposite to it, starting in the warm sector ahead of the front, and passing through into the cold sector behind it.",

Stable conditions mean that air which is forced to rise is colder than the air around it, and will sink again when the rising force ceases. Stable air means that the air will flow back down after the wind takes it over a mountain. This can leads to strong turbulence effects from mountain rotors and strong downdrafts on the lee-side of the mountain. Therefore, in stable conditions, the most turbulence will be found when downwind of a mountain or mountain range. In strong enough winds, stable air conditions can lead to mountain waves forming downwind of the mountain/mountain range which triggers them, and they are incredibly turbulent areas, with significant updrafts and downdrafts. In this case, the wind direction for the airport to be downwind of the mountain is from anywhere between about 040º and 100º, as the contour chart appears to show a bit of a mountain ridge line. Therefore, the correct answer is 070º.",

Let's delve into what this term signifies: When moist air ascends a mountain in stable conditions, it will cool adiabatically at the DALR until saturated, when it will continue cooling at the SALR. Precipitation will occur and removes moisture, lowering the dew point. As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms more than it cooled on the windward side. This leads to higher cloud bases and clear, turbulent conditions. The result is a warm, dry wind on the downside of the mountain, with temperature increases of over 10°C possible. Föhn winds may indicate the presence of mountain waves. In such conditions, the most severe turbulence often occurs in the rotor zone beneath the crests of lee waves, often indicated by roll clouds. The strongest rotor typically lies beneath the first wave crest, positioned one wavelength downwind. While flying in these waves can be smooth, there's a risk of encountering severe turbulence.",

According to Ballot’s Law, in the Northern Hemisphere, if one stands with one's back to the wind the atmospheric pressure will be lower on one's left. – Meaning that the LOW will be left of the arrow, therefore you’ll be flying towards it. Conclusion: When experiencing a crosswind from the left, you will be flying towards a LOW and a HIGH will be behind.

Clear air turbulence (CAT) refers to turbulence occurring in cloud-free air. Unlike convective turbulence, CAT is invisible and may lack obvious signs of its presence. Consequently, the associated turbulence can catch individuals off guard. CAT can be severe, leading to structural damage, physical harm to both crew and passengers, and even impairing crew performance to the extent that simple tasks like reading instruments become nearly impossible. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft, as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. It is crucial for pilots to report turbulence so that air traffic control (ATC) can issue advisories to other aircraft and provide requested information. Aircraft reports (AIREPs) are particularly valuable since they can indicate the presence of CAT if turbulence is reported by another aircraft flying along the same route. This information assists in determining the potential location of CAT.",

Mountain waves are the result of flowing air being forced to rise up the windward side of a mountain barrier, then as a result of certain atmospheric conditions, sinking down the leeward side. This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere. Mountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following atmospheric conditions are present: Wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band. Wind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height. A marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below If the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence. Provided there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds are formed with mountain waves and these provide useful warning of the presence of such waves. The clouds are: Lenticular, or lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found up to, and possibly above, the tropopause. Rotor, or roll-clouds occur under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind and will be level or slightly above the ridge crest. Cap clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes. Mountain Waves are associated with severe turbulence, strong vertical currents, and icing.",

The most generalized explanation of wind shear is “a change in wind speed and/or direction in space, including updrafts and downdrafts”. Wind shear is always present in the atmosphere and its presence is often visible to an observer. Examples are cloud layers at different levels moving in different directions; smoke plumes sheared and moving in different directions at different heights; rotating suspended debris and/or water droplets in the relatively innocuous dust devils and in the extremely dangerous water spouts and tornadoes; the “wall-like” leading edge of dust/sandstorms; and trees bending in all directions in response to sudden gusts from a squall line. All these visual effects testify to the universal presence of wind shear and wind shear-causing phenomena in the atmosphere. (ICAO Doc 9817 Manual on Low-level Wind Shear, Chapter 1)",

This means that the warm air mixes in a thicker layer than in colder air. Due to the intensive mixing processes, convective turbulence can often be expected on warm days. At night or in the winter, the extent of the friction layer decreases as the surface of the Earth cools (the atmosphere is more dense). Consequently, the intensity of the convection and the surface wind decreases Its minimum value is to be observed around sunrise. Note: Thermal turbulence is greatest around 1500 h on clear sunny days (when the highest temperatures are reached) - In weather conditions when thermal activity can be expected, many pilots prefer to fly in the early morning or in the evening when the thermal activity is not as severe.",

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

If Coriolis force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces). Geostrophic wind: Occurs above the friction layer. Occurs at a latitude greater than 15 degrees. Occurs when the isobars are straight, parallel and equidistant (constant gradient). Occurs when the pressure situation is not changing rapidly (constant gradient/equidistant).",

Low-level atmospheric divergence means that there is a net flow of air outwards from a location (the air is diverging) at the surface level. This occurs due to a surface high pressure region (anticyclone). This excess air that flows outwards must come from somewhere though, and it arrives from above, flowing down into the high pressure region in a process called subsidence. This subsidence causes clear weather conditions, as no air is rising (which would form clouds), instead all the air is sinking, and warming at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate). This makes the sinking air quite warm when it gets close to the ground, and often a high pressure inversion will form, with haze trapped underneath. The further we go back in the process, though, we can see that the air above the surface high pressure region must feed it with that air somehow, and that comes from air flowing inwards at the top of the troposphere (just under the tropopause), which is called things like \"convergence aloft\", \"high altitude convergence\", etc., they all mean the same thing. Effectively, there is a low pressure region at high altitude which takes in the air to feed the high pressure region at low altitude.",

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF ⇒ Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF ⇒ Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: gradient around a LOW < geostrophic < gradient around a HIGH.

Please do let us know if you see this question in the exam, so we can verify the figure shown, thank you. The jet stream is a fast moving \"ribbon\" of air in the upper troposphere, that occurs because of a large change in temperature between two air masses. Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because the tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes), due primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the Coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together, flowing from West to East. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall. All Jet streams flow from West to East (except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream). In the Northern Hemisphere, that is because the tropopause South of the jet stream is higher than the tropopause to the North. It is important to note that the boxed numbers (\"F300\", \"F370\", etc.) are the indications of the pressure altitude of the tropopause in flight levels. This notation is used in high altitude charts such as sig wx charts.",

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Whilst the wind is relatively smooth in general, there is a significant amount of windshear, causing heavy turbulence and rotor effects underneath the peaks of the wave. Mountain waves are not just at the height of the mountain peaks though, as they affect the air above themselves also, and, given the right conditions, can propagate as high as the tropopause. Lenticular clouds indicate the presence of mountain waves, and even though they look very calm, they are extremely dangerous to fly near, due to the effects mentioned above. That being said, not all mountain waves have lenticular clouds, so it is important to be careful of them when downwind of any mountain range with the correct conditions.",

Polar Front Jet Core altitude approx. 30 000 – 35 000ft, we are therefore flying above the core (FL400) JET STREAMS occur as a result of strong temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. Look at the example of the POLAR FRONT JET (SH): North of front – warm air mass => wider isobar spacing (tropical airmass). South of front – cold air mass => closer isobar spacing (Polar airmass). Tropical air mass tropopause – situated at a higher altitude and its temperature is lower, compared to the polar air tropopause. Polar air mass tropopause – situated at a lower altitude and its temperature is higher, compared to the tropical air tropopause. => Above the cold sector tropopause the temperature remains constant. But on the warm sector, temperatures will continue to decrease until the tropopause is reached. Which means that above the jet core, temperatures are colder in the warm sector. Therefore, we can say that flying from the south to the north (Cold sector to Warm sector SH) above the core, the temperature will decrease.

These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance. The Gradient wind occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow.

In the northern hemisphere, as this chart is, wind flows along the isobars, anti-clockwise around low pressure zones and clockwise around highs. That explains the wind arrows given on the annex above. This means that the stark change in the direction of the isobars causes a stark change in wind direction also. As we fly through the front, this is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense (known as \"backing\"), from approximately 280° (NW) to approximately 230°(SW). The isobars are also closer together after the second cold front, meaning that the wind speed is higher in this region, and therefore the wind gets faster after passing through the cold front. The cold front is moving from West to East in the diagram, as is expected with a front in this region (and shown by the direction of the \"spikes\" on the front. This means that \"in front\" of the cold front is the Eastern side of it, and \"behind\" the cold front is the Western side. Our track means that we \"overtake\" the front, starting behind it and passing through it to end up in front of it. Note: this is a variation on question 507036 which has been fed back to us.

            "explanation": "SURFACE WIND The geostrophic wind at altitude flows perpendicular to the pressure gradient force, due to the coriolis force. The coriolis force only becomes effective when enough speed has been gained, and near the ground, this speed is continuously reduced by friction. This means that the wind speed at the surface less than the free stream flow (geostrophic or gradient wind). We sometimes call this free stream flow the \"2000 ft wind\" because the boundary layer of the surface friction has usually ended by that height, so the \"2000 ft wind\" is usually unaffected by the surface friction. Surface wind is not just reduced in speed though, it is also changed in direction due to the reduction in coriolis force. This means that the surface wind will be more affected by the pressure gradient force (PGF) than the coriolis force (CF), so will flow towards the low pressure somewhat. This means that in the Northern Hemisphere, the surface wind is \"backed\" from the free stream wind, to go towards the low pressure (and it is \"veered\" in the Southern Hemisphere). The degree to the speed reduction and the subsequent direction change depends on the surface type (its friction) and the time of day (amount of vertical mixing). Day Night Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Directional change Percentage of \"2000 ft wind\" Land 30° 50% 40° 30% Sea 10° 70% 10° 70% So in Brussels during the day, the surface wind (9 kt) can be expected to be 50% of the \"2000 ft wind\". Therefore, the \"2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be approximately 18 kt. Furthermore, the direction is expected to be 30º different. As mentioned above, the surface wind is backed by this amount in the Northern Hemisphere, which means that the \"2000 ft\" wind is veered by 30º from the surface wind. Veering is an increase in the direction number, and backing is a decrease. Therefore, the \"2000 ft wind\" (free stream wind) would be coming from approximately 250 + 30 = 280° The correct answer is 280°/18 kt",

These strong winds also interact with the uneven terrain and with other nearby winds to cause significant turbulence for any overflying aircraft. To take a look at the other possible answers: Mountain waves can produce strong downdrafts which exceed the climb capability of some smaller aircraft, but not usually turbojet engined aircraft, as they climb far faster than smaller piston powered aircraft. There are not many smooth conditions when strong winds are present, and mountains only make the bumpiness worse. Usually the turbulence caused by mountains will subside with height above the mountain, only very occasionally does severe turbulence extend as high as the tropopause.",

Widely spaced isobars also imply a small pressure gradient force and since the pressure gradient force is small, we can expect light or calm wind. In this context the development of local wind systems is likely to occur: > Land and Sea Breezes > Katabatic and Anabatic winds Sea breezes On a sunny day, particularly in an anticyclone with a light PGF, the land will heat quickly. The air in contact will be warmed and will rise and expand so that pressure at about 1000 ft will be higher than pressure at the same level over the sea. This will cause a drift of air from over the land to over the sea at about 1000 ft. The drift of air will cause the surface pressure over the land to fall, and the surface pressure over the sea to rise. As a result there will be a flow of air from sea to land. On average, sea breezes extend 8 to 14 NM either side of the coast and the speed is about 10 kt. In the tropics speed is 15 kt or more and the inland extent is greater. The direction of the sea breeze is more or less at right angles to the coast, but after some time it will veer under the influence of the Coriolis Force. Land breezes From mid-afternoon the land is starting to cool and this process will accelerate after sunset. Overnight the situation will reverse and pressure will now be higher on land than over the sea as the temperature reduces. This will give rise to a wind now blowing from land to sea. The land breeze can be expected within about 5 NM of the coastline and with a maximum speed of about 5 kt. Katabatic wind A katabatic wind or mountain wind is caused by a flow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night. If the side of the mountain is cooled, the air in contact is also cooled: it will thus be denser and heavier than the surrounding air and it will therefore flow down the mountain side. The katabatic effect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the flow of cold air into the valley helps frost and fog to form. Another effect is that with the sinking of cold air down the slope, the air at higher levels will be warmer and an inversion results. Anabatic wind An anabatic wind or valley wind is a light wind of around 5 kt which blows up a hill or mountain by day. On a warm sunny day, the slope of a hill will become heated by insolation, particularly if it is a south facing slope. The air in contact with the ground will be heated by conduction and will rise up the hill. Free cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside.",

In case of this specific question: We are in the NH near the ground and have a wind blowing from 190 at 15 knots.

This means the wind is coming from the direction of the sea, which would be from the left side of the aircraft during final approach and landing. Further information: Sea breezes are most likely to occur on a sunny day, especially when an anticyclone with a gentle pressure gradient force (PGF) dominates the area, leading to rapid heating of the land. As the air in contact warms up, it expands and rises, creating higher pressure at approximately 1 000 feet above the land compared to the same level over the sea. This pressure difference prompts air to flow from over the land to over the sea at around 1 000 feet altitude. Consequently, surface pressure over the land decreases while surface pressure over the sea increases. This atmospheric setup results in a movement of air from the sea toward the land, known as a sea breeze. Note: The land-breeze blows during the night and is weaker than the sea-breeze.",

This model was not quite correct because in our temperate latitudes pressure is predominantly low because of the large scale frontal depressions. An American scientist, William Ferrel, proposed a modification to Hadley’s model introducing the modification arising because of the low pressure systems in temperate latitudes. This gives the three circulation cells: the Hadley cell between the Equator and the subtropics; the Ferrel cell between the subtropics and temperate latitudes; the Polar cell between temperate latitudes and the poles. This circulation means that we have, at the tropopause, air flowing outwards from the Equator towards the poles and from temperate latitudes towards the Equator. This creates an excess of air at the tropopause in subtropical regions which is forced to descend, hence creating the subtropical high pressure systems which are permanent features over the subtropical oceans (e.g. the Azores high in the North Atlantic).",

As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night. A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion. The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet The other options here are either incorrect or made up by the examiner. The polar night jet is another term for the arctic jetstream as far as we can tell. It happens around 20 000 ft around the poles during their winter, when they get extremely cold due to the polar night. A low-level sting jet is a mostly made up term. Sting jets are a thing to do with weather forecasting and can form very powerful storms but these jets are at high level, not formed in this way, and are way off the ATPL syllabus. A squall line jet is not a thing. Squall lines are line of thunderstorms, so certainly not the case in this scenario.",

The options are also quite debatable, and therefore the current correct answer is not confirmed. Please let us know if you see it in your exam and what you can remember about it, thank you! Aircraft flying close to a Jet Stream may encounter Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear. CAT occurs around the core of the jet stream, which is in the warm air sector. The CAT is strongest on the cold/polar/low pressure side of the jet stream core (the North side in the northern hemisphere) next to and just underneath the axis of the Jet Stream. Approx. at the cold air tropopause level (below the warm air tropopause level). Another area of strong shear is situated at the border of the upper level front. These areas are identified by red arrow on the attached figures. Note: Strong CAT areas are identified on charts by very close spacing of isotachs. Note: Core of the jet stream is located in the warm air – above the level of cold air tropopause and below the warm air tropopause. As can be seen in the first annex above, the highest CAT does exist at and above the tropopause near the core, as well as in the region of the front. Therefore, it can be best avoided under the tropopause (but depending on the scenario, this is quite debatable).",

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude. Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

Within 15° of the equator, the CF is very small, so the geostrophic wind formula is no longer valid Geostrophic wind: V = PGF ÷ ( 2 Ω ρ sin α ), where: Ω ρ V α = angular rotation of the earth = density = wind speed = latitude We can conclude that Geostrophic wind speed is inversely proportional to Latitude. Lower latitude ⇒ Greater speed. Therefore, the wind speed will be stronger at the lowest latitude of 60°S, 50°S and 40°S; which is 40°S.",

The equatorial jet stream forms due to the ITCZ going far North during the Northern Hemisphere summer months. The high level outflow from the ITCZ turns right as it flows away (North Hemisphere Coriolis), so the wind that flowed outwards, South towards the equator, turns right and builds up enough speed to flow East to West in the region of the equator above 80 kts, and is considered a jet stream. It therefore only forms in the areas where there is significant land North of the Equator, and much less land South of the Equator. This means that it primarily forms over South-East Asia, South India and Central/West Africa.",

            "explanation": "After reading this question, the first thing that pops in my mind is a Valley Inversion - due to the location of the airfield (basin within mountainous area) and the presence of a High Pressure system. To simplify this question, let's break it down in two parts: \"in the early morning\" and \"engines of the aircraft will deliver more thrust after breaking through the inversion layer if the pilot does not intervene.\" explained: A Valley Inversion forms as a result of both cooling of the ground during a clear night (typical High Pressure weather conditions.) due to long-wave radiation and nocturnal down-slope winds. The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is formed. => Since inversions occur most often during the night, its effects will be more marked in the early morning. Moreover, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we descend through an inversion, temperature decreases with a decrease in height => we will experience an increased aircraft performance, leading to an increase in thrust and lift, as we dense into colder and denser air. \"after a short period of bumpiness\" explained: Temperature Inversions are associated with potential windshear at the top of the inversion. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion and turbulence.",

Clear air turbulence is a remarkably difficult to detect as a pilot (until you are within it), as no radar returns will ever show it. Both airborne weather radar and ground radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot. Unfortunately, this does nothing to help us detect clear air turbulence (CAT), as, by definition, there are no particles to receive returns from, so RADARs will not pick it up. This is the same for satellite sensors, which also would not be able to pick up this invisible phenomenon. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft, as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is very much guesswork, and CAT can appear in unexpected places with no warning. It would certainly be difficult to pick up with a weather balloon, as CAT areas are isolated and the chance of the weather balloon ascending through one is small.",

The image depicted in the annex given is of a cold front \"chasing\" a warm front, which is most often seen as part of a polar front depression (often called a travelling low). This is an unstable low pressure zone that forms along the polar front and travels from West to East. As the polar front is the border between the cold polar air and warmer sub-tropical air, which is called a front, this depression twists the front into two separate fronts, a warm front, and a cold front \"chasing\" it. The jetstream is a wide band of fast flowing air that sits in the warm air section of this interaction at high altitude, with the wind generally going from West to East (but it is very rarely straight, it often bends and snakes around pressure patterns). Due to the slant of the front (warm air sits over cold), the jetstream is within the warm sector, but is actually overhanging the cold sector, so looks like it is inside the cold air when viewed from above (as we often mark the front locations due to their surface positions, but this is different from their positions up near the tropopause). As the weather fronts are bent by the depression, so is the polar front in general, as is the jetstream which follows this polar front. The jetstream therefore sits in front of the warm front and behind the cold front due to the slant, meaning that the point on this diagram where the jetstream is westerly is Point C (The jetstream is usually wider than in the annex above). The jetstream also sits much further in front of the warm front than it does behind the cold front due to the different slant ratios of warm and cold fronts, warm fronts have shallower gradients, so go on for many more miles before reaching the tropopause where the front ends.",

Learning Objective 050.02.06.02.02: State where turbulence will normally be found (rough-ground surfaces, relief, inversion layers, cumulonimbus (CB), thunderstorm (TS) zones, unstable layers). Turbulence is caused by violent or unsteady movement of air, and describes the effect of the aircraft being jolted around in flight, often unpredictably, putting increased strain on the airframe and decreasing passenger comfort. It can be caused by vertical movement of air \"pockets\", through either convective or mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called windshear. Convective turbulence occurs due to either instability in the air causing vertical air movement (cumulus type clouds show this effect) or by thermal heating of the ground. The Earth's surface is made up of different materials, and these absorb and radiate heat energy at different rates, that means that an airport (lots of tarmac or concrete) may create a much warmer pocket of air than a grassy meadow, for instance, and this will cause a significant difference in air movement between the two. Mechanical turbulence is caused due to undulations and objects on the Earth's surface. Buildings, trees, hills and mountains can change the pattern of the wind, and cause eddy currents of wind in the air close to the ground. This can cause a lot of turbulence at lower levels, such as after take-off or on the approach. Orographic turbulence is another name for this, but is more specific to the turbulence caused by hills, mountains, etc. The time of worst turbulence during the day is usually early to mid-afternoon, where the ground is radiating the most heat, and therefore the pockets of air are at their most different to each other, causing the most turbulence. Higher winds also contribute to more mechanical turbulence, especially when the terrain is rough and there are plenty of obstacles for the wind to hit.",

            "explanation": "The low level jet stream is a term used for a wind at around 5000 ft above the surface, which forms due to either intense, uneven surface cooling at night, or the movement of a cold mass of air over the ground. The movement of this cold mass of air pushes under the warmer air and creates an inversion that looks exactly like a small cold front. The marked temperature difference between the warm and cold air causes a pressure differential, which causes a wind up to around 70 kts in the warm air section, which sits over the cold air that is moving in. These are common in the central United States and the plains of Southern Germany, amongst other places, and are not technically a jet stream according to the World Meteorological Organisation's definition. They occur in a similar fashion to a jet stream, though, hence the name. Note: Technically, the low-level nocturnal jetstream exists above the inversion, however, the answer (from feedback) may still be somewhat correct, as the question does not make it clear what is meant by the \"top of the inversion\". As we would usually see this from a side-on view, we know that the low-level jetstream exists in the warm air (in front of the cold front), with its \"core\" high up away from the surface, and near the top of where the cold front extends up to. This would usually mean being above the inversion when referenced to a single location, but is a little unclear in this question This may be what the examiner is referring to, so if anyone has exam feedback about the wording of the correct answer, it would be very useful to verify this question.

Turbulence is caused by violent or unsteady movement of air, and describes the effect of the aircraft being jolted around in flight, often unpredictably, putting increased strain on the airframe and decreasing passenger comfort. It can be caused by vertical movement of air \"pockets\", through either convective or mechanical means, or can be caused by a sudden change in horizontal wind speed, called windshear. Clouds can be a good indication of the air patterns present, as stratiform clouds show stable, non-turbulent air, and cumuliform clouds show the presence of unstable, turbulent air. Cumulus clouds are formed when air rises, and by doing so, becomes warmer than its environment, due to a high ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate, the air wants to continue to rise. Rising air cools down, and therefore becomes closer to the dewpoint (the relative humidity rises) until the dewpoint is reached, and the air becomes saturated, forming a cloud. Therefore, the air just below a cumulus cloud is rising at quite a rate, but not perfectly evenly, due to unstable heating, meaning that there is a large difference in updraft speed from one pocket of air to the next, which causes lots of turbulence. The base of a cumulus cloud often has more turbulence than the rest of the cloud, on average. Downdrafts can also occur in cumulus clouds, and this would cause even greater turbulence, when happening next to an updraft.",

It is also very much an ATPL question only, as it refers specifically to what we are supposed to know about meteorology, and does not include any further knowledge. Please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and what you remember from it, so we can verify the question and options, thank you! There are a few different bits of knowledge that you need here. Firstly, you must understand the global circulation pattern of air around the Earth. Things such as; where is a consistent high pressure surface zone, the ITCZ, ascending and subsiding air zones, and particularly travelling lows. Then you must understand how the jet streams are formed based on that global circulation. Finally, you must understand how jet streams are affected by (and affect) the surface weather conditions, and then you have to link all that information together. When you do, you find that the correct answer is the polar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere. Some people will be happy to leave it at that, and know the answer, but for those of you who want to know why, see the explanation below. It will have to skip over lots of details, as there are a lot of topics to link together here and this explanation could get huge if everything were to be explained in full. Assuming you know about the global circulation pattern of air, you will know that the polar front (between the Ferrel cell and polar cell of the atmosphere) creates \"travelling lows\", also known as polar front depressions. For the purposes of the exams, these form somewhat consistently over the oceans; for us in Europe, we see the ones flowing from the Atlantic. There are a few different jet streams that form over the Earth. There are the subtropical jet stream over the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, which is quite consistent, as well as the polar jet stream, also in both hemispheres and relatively consistent through the seasons. There is an arctic jet stream that forms over the pole which is in its winter (polar night - extremely cold). There is also a jet stream which flows the opposite way to the others (it is Easterly rather than the usual Westerlies) which is the equatorial jet stream, forming around June-August. The jet streams have a large effect on the surface weather, particularly that beneath them, and this relationship goes both ways, with the surface pressure patterns and surface temperature very much affecting the jet stream's flow, speed and direction. In particular, the jet stream we must know most about is the polar jet stream, and this is the one that sits above (not directly above - but close to) the surface level travelling lows on the polar front. Each travelling low causes the polar jet stream to bend, as the polar front is bent as part of the frontogenesis cycle. This is what the question is asking. The other jet streams are not bent as strongly or as often as the polar jet stream, due to their different circulation patterns. Thankfully, it is not asked in this question, but between the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and the Southern Hemisphere polar jet stream, we would say that they both bend significantly, but the much greater amount of landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere create a more \"unstable\" jet stream, in that has much less regular movements, whereas the Southern Hemisphere has a lot less land to interfere with the jet stream. Travelling lows still form in the Southern Hemisphere, but have a more regular pattern.",

            "explanation": "It is important to realise how pressure systems act in the different hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Southern Hemisphere is the other way around: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your right-hand side. In the case of this specific question: The aircraft is flying on a heading of 270, so flying west. If the wind would come from 360 degrees (so from the right side of the aircraft) the true altitude would be increasing. Imagine standing with your back into the wind, so facing South. The low-pressure area would be on your left side (this is also the side the aircraft is coming from). And the high-pressure area would be on your right. We know that if we fly from a low to a high-pressure area the true altitude increase. If the QNH in an area changes, we have to think about what consequence this has on our flight. Since we fly on a Flight level (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But our actual flight level will. Because the altimeter is only accurate in the Standard Atmosphere and we now are experiencing a higher actual pressure, the altimeter will under read. The actual altitude will be higher. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below! This is correct for both pressure and temperature.",

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. In this scenario, despite the absence of returns on the airborne weather radar, the aircraft could encounter clear air turbulence as a result of mountain wave activity.",

            "explanation": "Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed. This reduction will reduce the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force. The latter is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars towards the lower pressure. This wind is called surface wind. In the Southern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle - towards the LOW - and, therefore, be deflected to the right (wind veers) compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (ie. Wind at 4000 ft). Hence, the increasing crosswind from the right during approach. This question states that the headwind becomes crosswind from the right (= clockwise = veer). In the Northern Hemisphere, surface winds tend to \"back\". As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic.",

As we fly through the front, this is a change in direction in the anti-clockwise sense known as \"backing\".

These 2 forces, Pressure Gradient Force PGF and Coriolis Force CF, must be working opposite from each other and in balance. The Gradient wind occurs when isobars are curved. There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow. Note that we are comparing the gradient wind in a LOW/HIGH to the equivalent Geostrophic wind and not the gradient wind around a HIGH to the gradient wind around a LOW.",

Rotation of air (winds) around a HIGH is: Northern Hemisphere = outward from centre and clockwise, Southern Hemisphere = outward from centre and anti-clockwise. Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed, this which directly reduces the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force (PGF). The PGF is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE. This wind is called surface wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (first annex above). In this diagram, the free stream wind (gradient wind - as it is orbiting the low) will simply follow the isobars anti-clockwise around the low, not getting any closer. The surface wind, on the other hand, is directed slightly inwards (second annex above), so spirals inwards. This means that aircraft \"C\" is pointing directly into wind, and it is also in an area of tighter isobars, meaning that the windspeed will be higher aswell.",

            "explanation": "A synoptic chart in meteorology is any chart that shows a summary of conditions, so usually a pressure chart over a wide area. Pressure patterns dictate the movement of air, the wind; high and low pressure is self-explanatory, when there is low pressure, there is less air, so less force acting upon objects. The laws of thermodynamics like equilibrium, and therefore high pressure always tries to flow to low pressure to equalise the two. This is called the pressure gradient force, and forms the wind direction, along with the coriolis force. The coriolis force is that which causes air to turn right in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the different rotational speeds of the Earth's surface. It means that air will end up following the isobars on a pressure chart, perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. This makes it very difficult for high pressure to flow to low pressure, as it gets turned away from its path as soon as it starts moving. There is, however, some air that manages to escape a high pressure zone, and some air which enters a low pressure zone. This mostly happens near the surface, where the friction effects of the surface reduce the coriolis force, and the pressure gradient force can do more. The outflow of air from a high is called divergence. For air to flow outwards near the surface, the air has to come from somewhere, and it arrives from above, travelling down inside the high pressure zone. This creates clear weather conditions with a high chance of inversion after a few days. The inflow of air into a low is called convergence. As the air comes together, it has to travel somewhere, and it is forced upwards, which causes uplift and creates clouds, and therefore weather. In this question, they are asking about the atmospheric convergence from a low pressure zone. As mentioned above, this is where some air is able to travel across the isobars and towards towards the low pressure.",

As air temperatures near the ground drop after sunset, an inversion layer is formed in the lower atmosphere during the night. A Nocturnal jet is likely to form just above the inversion. The following points may be of value to forecasters in predicting the occurrence and strength of the nocturnal jet: There should be sufficient radiative cooling (clear skies) to allow a nocturnal inversion to develop. A fully developed jet is likely to breakdown through turbulent mixing if the stability across the jet is unable to absorb the turbulence generated by the jet (through vertical wind shear). This is why a nocturnal jet needs to co-exist with an inversion. The structure of the surface may also determine the strength of the jet. If the geostrophic wind remains constant but the surface roughness increases, then the jet would also increase. If the geostrophic wind is too strong, it will destroy the nocturnal inversion; if it is too light, it will produce a weak jet",

At night, the surfaces of mountain slopes cool down, causing the air in contact with them to become colder and denser. This cold, dense air sinks towards the valley floor, accumulating and pooling in the center of the valley.

Further information: MOUNTAIN/LEE WAVES develop on the lee, or downwind, side of mountains. If sufficient moisture is available in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds may form serving as an useful warning of such waves. These clouds are: LENTICULAR. lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind. They may be found at several levels, sometimes up to the tropopause. Normally airflow through these clouds is smooth - Ragged edges indicate turbulence. ROTOR/ROLL-CLOUDS often indicates the presence of a rotor phenomenon. Occurs under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind (located below the first crest). CAP clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes. May be an indication that there might be more dangerous mountain wave phenomena on the downwind side.",

Jet streams can be described as a core of strong winds (speeds >/= 60 kts) around 5 to 7 miles above the Earth’s surface, generally blowing from west to east. These occur as a result of strong horizontal temperature contrasts in the atmosphere. There is a strong relationship between jet streams and clear air turbulence. CAT is caused by the vertical and horizontal wind shear of jet streams. CAT is most severe on the cold side of the jet, next to and just underneath the axis of the jet and not in the core of the jet stream => across the core, temperature is more or less constant. “At 500 ft/AGL mechanical turbulence occurs more often than at 5000 ft/AGL.” CORRECT. Mechanical Turbulence (Frictional turbulence) - is caused by physical obstructions to the normal ﬂow of air such as hills, mountains, coasts, trees and buildings. This kind of turbulence will increase as the wind speed increases. It occurs within the friction layer (2000 – 3000ft).",

This causes a change in wind direction – wind blows somewhat across the isobars towards the low pressure. As we move higher, surface friction has less effect on the wind until the wind is indeed Geostrophic - and blows parallel to isobars. => Frictional forces cause the wind to convergence at the surface around a LOW and diverge around HIGH.

As the wind gains speed, the deflection increases until the Coriolis force equals the pressure gradient force. At this point, the wind will be blowing parallel to the isobars. When this happens, the wind is referred to as geostrophic. The geostrophic wind is directed parallel to isobars and the strength is directly proportional to the spacing of the isobars. It is found at altitudes of around 2 000 feet and above. The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Thus, the actual wind would equal the geostrophic wind only if there were no friction and the isobars were perfectly straight. In case of this specific question: True altitude remains constant, so we will be flying at at constant pressure which will be parallel to isobars. Geostrophic wind is parallel to isobars so we will not have any crosswind. That is why this statement is correct.",

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind. CF = PGF + Centrifugal Force HENCE, the relationship being: VST < VHigh and VST > VLow. Note that we are comparing the gradient wind in a LOW/HIGH to the equivalent Geostrophic wind and not the gradient wind around a HIGH to the gradient wind around a LOW.",

            "explanation": "The jet stream is a fast moving \"ribbon\" of air in the upper troposphere, that occurs because of a large change in temperature between two air masses. Take the Polar jet stream, for instance. It happens because the tropopause of the Ferrel Cell (Mid-Latitude, sub-tropical air) is higher than that of the Polar Cell (High Latitudes), due primarily to the higher temperature of the Ferrel cell. This means that there is a large pressure differential between the cells at the same true altitude. The Ferrel Cell air has higher pressure (at the same true altitude) than air in the Polar Cell. This pressure gradient force causes the wind to want to flow to the North. Due to the coriolis effect, this then turns right and a large collection of air joins together, flowing from West to East. When this gets above 80kt, it is called a jet stream. Jet streams can be hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, but only a few thousand feet tall. All Jet streams flow from West to East (except the Equatorial jet, which isn't a true jet stream). In the Northern Hemisphere, that is because the tropopause South of the jet stream is higher than the tropopause to the North. It is important to note that the boxed numbers (\"300\", \"380\", etc.) are the indications of the pressure altitude of the tropopause in flight levels. This notation is used in high altitude charts such as sig wx charts.",

You can now draw an arrow (represented by purple arrow) representing the wind direction – GEOSTROPHIC WIND. 5. However, In the Southern Hemisphere, we know that friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle towards the low (represented by yellow arrow) Therefore, when flying in the friction layer and away from a LOW in the SH, we will experience a crosswind from the left, slightly on the nose. Keep in mind the general wind circulation: Northern Hemisphere; around a LOW it is anti-clockwise and around a HIGH it is clockwise. Southern Hemisphere; around a LOW it is clockwise and around a HIGH it is anti-clockwise.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.02.02.01.07: Explain the gradient wind effect and indicate how the gradient wind differs from the geostrophic wind in cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation. This question is made up of two parts, first we need to know which latitude the wind will be weakest at, and secondly we need to know whether high or low pressure zones (anti-cyclones or cyclones) have the lowest gradient wind speed. To start, we have to understand how the (geostrophic) wind works. 1. Initially, wind begins as a flow of air perpendicular to the isobars, initially under the influence of the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF), from high to low pressure. 2. As the movement begins, the Coriolis Force (CF) begins to influence the moving air causing it to be deflected to the right of its path in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If the Coriolis Force was not present, the air would flow directly from the high to the low pressure, at 90º angle to the isobars, under the influence of the PGF. 3. This deflection continues until PGF and CF are opposite and balance each other and the airflow becomes parallel to the isobars – PGF and CF act perpendicular to the airflow direction and opposite to each other (balanced forces). The Coriolis Force is directly proportional to the speed of the wind, so when we have a high PGF, we need a high CF to oppose it, and the wind flows faster. The Coriolis Force also gets stronger away from the equator, due to the changing distance from the Earth's rotational axis (barely any change around the equator, lots of change up at the poles). This means that, near the equator, air has to get a lot faster to work up enough Coriolis Force to oppose the PGF, meaning higher wind speeds. Therefore, the further away from the equator (the higher the latitude), the slower the wind speeds (for the same PGF, which is the isobar spacing) Next, we must understand what the gradient wind is, and when it is strongest/weakest. Previously, we have spoken about the geostrophic wind, which is the wind that flows along straight isobars. That is a rarity though, and more often, isobars are curved, meaning that the wind is turning. This introduces imbalanced forces, which cause this turning of the wind. Note: There are a couple of different ways to reason and understand gradient winds, centrifugal force and centripetal force. Centrifugal force is not actually a force at all, it is the effect of inertia in a turn. Nonetheless, you may have learnt either of these two ways. We believe centripetal force is slightly easier to explain in text format, so we will do that. If you wish to take the easy road here, remember that, for the same isobar spacing (same PGF), gradient wind speed is LOW around a LOW, and HIGH around a HIGH. This means the wind is slower around a low pressure zone (cyclone) and faster around a high pressure zone (anticyclone). This should be sufficient for the vast majority of questions. If you would like to gain a slightly higher level of understanding, continue reading. The change of direction of the wind happens because of imbalanced forces, and the two main forces on the wind are Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and Coriolis Force. If either becomes larger than the other, then the wind will bend in that direction. This means that in a high pressure zone, for instance, the PGF outwards is not as strong as the Coriolis Force inwards, as the wind is bending in the direction of the Coriolis Force. To do this, the wind has to go faster than usual (usual being the geostrophic, straight line wind), to build up a higher Coriolis Force. The opposite is happening around the low pressure zone. The PGF is stronger than the Coriolis Force, meaning that the resultant, or \"residual\", force is going inwards towards the low. This means that the Coriolis Force is weaker than usual, and therefore the wind speed is less than the geostrophic wind. This \"residual force\" is what we call centripetal force, and is the force which causes rotation to occur. It is a force towards the centre of rotation, and without it, objects will just continue in the same direction. We need centripetal force to allow wind to bend around low and high pressure zones, and it comes from imbalanced PGF and Coriolis Force, which causes the low around a low and high around a high behaviour we have discussed. Remember, the PGF stays the same, but the Coriolis Force changes due to the wind speed. In conclusion then, to get the weakest wind speeds with the same isobar spacing, we need a high latitude and a low pressure zone, so 50ºN and a cyclonic system.",

As this air sinks, it compresses and warms up, often dispersing any cloud cover that may be present. At the surface, the air diverges. This scenario is characteristic of high-pressure, or anticyclonic, weather systems, which typically denote fair weather conditions. On the other hand, when air converges at ground level and spirals inward, it forces the air to ascend. As the air rises, it expands and cools, potentially leading to cloud formation. At higher altitudes, the upward-moving air can diverge. This pattern is typical of low-pressure systems, or depressions, which frequently result in cloud formation and precipitation.",

Near the surface, friction reduces the wind speed, this which directly reduces the Coriolis force. The weaker Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force (PGF). The PGF is now more dominant, and the wind blows across the isobars TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE LOWER PRESSURE. This wind is called surface wind. In the Northern Hemisphere, friction causes the surface wind to blow across the isobars at an angle and be deflected to the left compared to the equivalent geostrophic wind (first annex above). In this diagram, the free stream wind (gradient wind - as it is orbiting the high) will simply follow the isobars clockwise around the high, not getting any closer. The surface wind, on the other hand, is directed slightly outwards (second annex above), so spirals outwards. This means that aircraft \"B\" is pointing directly into wind, and it is also in an area of tighter isobars, meaning that the windspeed will be higher aswell.",

This scenario is characteristic of high-pressure, or anticyclonic, weather systems, which typically denote fair weather conditions. On the other hand, when air converges at ground level and spirals inward, it forces the air to ascend. As the air rises, it expands and cools, potentially leading to cloud formation. At higher altitudes, the upward-moving air can diverge. This pattern is typical of low-pressure systems, or depressions, which frequently result in cloud formation and precipitation.",

So if you were to travel from south to north = Warm sector to cold sector beneath the core, temperatures would decrease. Note: Above the cold sector tropopause the temperature remains constant. But on the warm sector, temperatures will continue to decrease until it reaches the tropopause. Which means that above the jet core, temperatures are colder in the warm sector.

There is a force that comes into play which makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to isobars. It is, therefore, a combination of 3 forces: PGF CF Centrifugal Force (acts perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from centre of rotation) GRADIENT WIND IN A LOW The Centrifugal force opposes the PGF => Reducing the wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a LOW is less than the equivalent geostrophic wind. PGF = CF + Centrifugal Force GRADIENT WIND IN A HIGH The Centrifugal Force acts in the same direction as the PGF => Increasing wind speed. Therefore, for the same isobar spacing, gradient wind speed in a HIGH is greater than the equivalent geostrophic wind.

            "explanation": "Note: Remember that Geostrophic force is not Geostrophic Wind. GF is, in other words, Coriolis Force. GEOSTROPHIC FORCE The geostrophic wind flows parallel to straight isobars, limiting its movement to a straight trajectory. The geostrophic wind is under the influence of two primary forces: the Pressure Gradient Force (PGF) and the Coriolis Force (CF). The PGF prompts air movement from regions of high pressure towards those of low pressure, acting at a right angle (90°) to the isobars. In the absence of the Coriolis Force, air would move directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, perpendicular to the isobars. However, the Coriolis Force (CF) plays a role in the air's motion, which changes with latitude and wind speed. (At the Equator, CF is negligible and it strengthens as one moves towards the poles; it also intensifies with increasing wind speed.) As the air begins moving, the CF, acting at a 90° angle to the airflow, deflects it (to the right in the Northern hemisphere). When the CF combines with the PGF, the airflow's velocity increases due to this additional force. Consequently, the CF's influence grows, leading to further deflection and increased speed, creating a feedback loop. Eventually, the CF strengthens to the point of equilibrium with the PGF, causing the airflow to become parallel to the isobars. The Geostrophic Force increases with the speed of the air, and it is dependent on the sine of the latitude, being maximum at the Poles (sin 90° = 1) and zero at the Equator.",

Please send any exam feedback to us via the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. This question is quite difficult to answer, as jet streams do cause very intense clear air turbulence due to vertical and horizontal windshear. Mountainous areas can produce mountain waves, especially when a stable atmosphere exists (so the air flows down again after being forced upwards), and mountain waves can travel way up into the atmosphere when there is a gradually strengthening wind, which would likely be the case if a jet stream is present at high altitudes. The aircraft is a jet aircraft in the cruise, so we can assume it is at high altitude, around the region of 30 000 - 45 000 ft, just inside or above the jetstream. To give an answer to this question, we can be almost certain that there will be clear air turbulence occuring due to the jetstream, and we could potentially expect to see some mountain waves from the mountainous area below, but that is a much bigger assumption to make, and it is definitely not assured that mountain waves will form at all, and therefore even less likely that we will feel them at cruising altitude. Therefore, we are more likely to see clear air turbulence. Also, mountain waves do cause turbulence, often without clouds, so the effect is also classed as clear air turbulence. To deal with the less likely options, cumulonimbus activity and altocumulus clouds require an unstable atmosphere.",

These currents disrupt the typical airflow, with variable convection intensifying this effect. Often referred to as thermal turbulence, it's particularly pronounced around 3:00 pm during clear, sunny conditions. Notably, convective turbulence isn't present over the sea. In the morning, the atmosphere is typically more stable due to cooler temperatures overnight. This stability tends to keep the air closer to the ground calmer. In stable conditions, the vertical movement of air is limited, and hence, the up currents created by the surface friction are limited as to the height they can reach. So, when you're flying early in the morning, the turbulent layer, where you might encounter bumpy air, remains below 2 000 feet. This means that at your cruising altitude of 2 500 feet, you're likely to experience smoother flying conditions. On the other hand, in the afternoon, the sun has been heating up the ground for several hours, causing the air near the surface to become more turbulent due to convective processes.",

Warmer air can hold more water vapour than colder air. When a parcel of air becomes overfilled with water vapour, the excess water will begin to condense into water droplets, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets. The change of state from vapour is not always into droplets though. Water vapour can also change straight to ice, if the temperature is below 0°C. The water vapour actually prefers to turn straight into ice where possible due to vapour pressure differences, and this process is called deposition (gas to solid state change). It is also referred to as sublimation in America for some reason, even though Sublimation is the change of state from solid to gas, but the American interpretation is gaining more traction, so be on the lookout for people using it to describe a gas to solid state change. Freezing is a change of state from liquid to solid Evaporation is a change of state from liquid to gas. Condensation is from gas to liquid Sublimation is from solid to gas (and is also from gas to solid in some countries) Obviously at a dew point of +8°C, the water vapour is going to begin condensing into water droplets.",

As warm air can hold more water vapour than cold, saturation can be achieved by cooling the air (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion = lifting the parcel to a higher level) Combination of both above.",

It does vary a little, depending on the state of the atmosphere in each location, but it is a good rule of thumb. If we assume that the cold air has moved in at this altitude and above, our next step is to determine the ISA deviation. At FL180, the ISA temperature is -21ºC (15 - 2 x 18). Therefore, the temperature deviation from ISA is -9ºC. Similarly, at FL200, the ISA temperature is -25ºC, so the ISA deviation of -9ºC results in a temperature of -34ºC. However, this specific option is not among the available answers. We initially believed that \"-25ºC\" would be the most accurate choice from the given options. However, based on consistent feedback, it appears that this option is considered incorrect. In light of this feedback, we have revised the correct option to \"-36ºC or below.\"",

Air can only hold so much water in vapour form, so in excess of this amount, water condenses on nuclei (such as dust, salt or sand) in the atmosphere, creating clouds of water droplets. When water does condense from vapour into droplets, it releases \"latent heat\" (as it has gone from a high energy state of matter to a lower energy state). This warms up the atmosphere. It is this warming that fuels the continued uplift of convective clouds and large convective storms, and storm systems. This release of latent heat means that clouds are more often warmer than their surrounding air, and therefore will continue to rise. We call this atmospheric instability. It takes quite a high environmental lapse rate for dry air to be unstable (more than the DALR [3ºC/1000ft]), but when a cloud forms, and more water condenses as the cloud gets higher (in colder air), it becomes much easier for an air mass to be unstable. The ELR only needs to be more than the SALR (2ºC/1000ft), and the cloud will want to continue to rise, as it is constantly warmer than its surroundings. It is this condensation, and the heat it releases, that feeds the large updrafts in convective clouds, and creates the intense storms that can come from cumulonimbus clouds, and tropical revolving storms too.",

For a liquid surface it will be much easier for water molecules to break free and evaporate than for a solid surface (ie. Ice). That is because the bonds between adjacent molecules are stronger in an ice surface than they are in a water surface. At the same temperature, fewer molecules will break free from an ice surface than from a water surface, => Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure over liquid water.",

This temperature is called the dew point. In this question, the relative humidity at the cloud base will obviously be higher than at the ground, as the air is colder at height (unstable atmosphere means no inversion, and cumulus clouds would not begin to form otherwise). In fact, the relative humidity at the cloud base should be exactly 100%, as this is why the cloud is now forming in any air currents that have risen. The dew point is slightly more complicated. It actually decreases slightly with altitude due to the decreasing pressure (and therefore postpones the saturation of the air mass a little at higher altitudes). Therefore the dew point at the cloud base will be lower than at the ground. Further information: A parcel of air can hold a certain amount of water in vapour form. That amount depends on the temperature of the parcel of air. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than colder air. When a parcel of air becomes overfilled with water vapour, the excess water will begin to condense into water droplets, which forms clouds, fog and dew. This most often occurs because the air parcel cools down for some reason, and therefore can no longer hold the water vapour that was already inside it, and as it cools, more and more water is released to condense into droplets. A parcel of air's water vapour content is its absolute humidity (the actual amount of water vapour present). A more useful metric is its relative humidity though, and this is its water vapour content, as a percentage of its maximum (saturated) water vapour content. When a parcel of air cools down without adding or losing water vapour, its relative humidity increases, because the colder air has a lower maximum humidity (saturation point). When the relative humidity of an air parcel reaches 100%, the air is saturated, and the water begins to condense into droplets if any further water is added, or any cooling occurs.",

The increase in molecular movement causes an increase in the temperature of the parcel. EXPANSION. In the atmosphere, pressure decreases as altitude increases. Again, imagine an isolated parcel of air moving vertically through the troposphere. As altitude increases, the pressure exerted on the parcel decreases and the parcel expands in volume as a result. In order to expand (do work), the parcel must use its internal energy to do so. As the air expands, the molecules spread out and ultimately collide less with one another.

            "explanation": "HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air. Humidity Measurement Absolute Humidity Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3 Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR) Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature. Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR) The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel. Expressed as g/kg of dry air. Relative Humidity (RH) The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage. Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air. RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100 RH 100% = Saturation Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated. From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa. Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.",

As the temperature rises, the saturated mixing ratio increases, while it decreases with a reduction in temperature. During the day, as the temperature increases, the relative humidity (RH) tends to decrease. This is because warmer air has a higher capacity to hold moisture, allowing it to accommodate a larger amount of water vapor. However, as the day progresses and reaches around 1500 hrs, the temperature starts to decrease. As the temperature drops, the air's capacity to hold water vapor also decreases. This leads to an increase in the relative humidity during the evening and night hours. The higher relative humidity at night is particularly significant during autumn and winter when mist and fog tend to form after dark. The rising RH during the night is a result of the reduced temperature and the limited ability of the air to hold water vapor.

Warmer air can hold more water vapour than cold air. The dew point is a temperature, at which, a certain parcel of air will become saturated, and begin to condense. When the temperature is warmer than the dew point, it means that the air can fit more water vapour in before it reaches saturation. However, as the air cools, its Relative Humidity (RH) will increase, and when it reaches the dew point, the RH will be 100% and the air is fully saturated. If the air continues cooling from this point, it will have to release water to do so, which forms a cloud. For every degree difference between the dew point and the temperature, the Relative Humidity decreases by 5%. Therefore, we can calculate the Relative Humidity by saying that we have a 30 - 21 = 9⁰C difference between OAT and dew point, which is 9 x 5 = 45% difference in RH, below the saturated 100%. 100% - 45% = 55% Relative Humidity",

Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated (relative humidity = 100%). Dew point temperature can never be greater than the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools below the original dew point, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation. Summary: • for unsaturated air – dew point is lower than air temperature; and • for saturated air – dew point is equal to air temperature. “2. For unsaturated air the dew-point temperature is lower than the temperature” CORRECT. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated. Dew point temperature is NEVER GREATER than the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation.",

It effectively works backwards from the knowledge that having a temperature and dew point that are the same means that the air has 100% relative humidity, and it fully saturated. The temperature can never be less than the dew point. Relative Humidity (%) = 100 - [(Temperature - Dewpoint) x 5] For each degree Celsius difference between our temperature and dewpoint, there is a 5% reduction in relative humidity, starting from 100%, where the numbers are the same. This question has a 12ºC difference between temperature and dewpoint, which is a 60% reduction from 100%, so the relative humidity is 40%.",

Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air. RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100 RH 100% = Saturation As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated. From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa. Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases. Now, with regards to this question, if the parcel of air is forced to descend it will become compressed and hence heat up, by the adiabatic process => Since its temperature increases, provided that the amount of water vapour remains the same - Relative humidity decreases.",

If you squeeze it, water will come out but it will remain filled.

As the number of water vapour molecules increases, the vapour pressure increases. If heat is added and temperature increased, the molecules will have more internal energy and will start to move faster. Eventually, they will be able to break free and evaporate from the surface and the vapor pressure will increase => the saturation vapor pressure increases when the temperature increases. For a liquid surface it will be much easier for water molecules to break free and evaporate than for a solid surface (ie. Ice). That is because the bonds between adjacent molecules are stronger in an ice surface than they are in a water surface. At the same temperature, fewer molecules will break free from an ice surface than from a water surface, => Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure over liquid water. “For unsaturated air the dew-point temperature is lower than the temperature” CORRECT Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated. Dew point temperature is NEVER GREATER than the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation. Summary: for unsaturated air – dew point is lower than air temperature; and for saturated air – dew point is equal to air temperature.",

As the air expands, the molecules spread out and ultimately collide less with one another. The work of expansion causes the air’s temperature to decrease. CONTRACTION. In the atmosphere, pressure increases as altitude decreases. Again, imagine an isolated air parcel descending through the troposphere, as altitude decreases, it experiences an increasing atmospheric pressure. This causes the parcel volume to decrease, squeezing the air molecules closer together. In this case, work is being done on the parcel. As the volume shrinks, air molecules bounce off one another more often with greater speed. The increase in molecular movement causes an increase in the temperature of the parcel.",

            "explanation": "Orographic cloud => saturated air mass As an air parcel descends, it is compressed, and its temperature increases adiabatically. The rate at which temperature increases is dependent on the type of air parcel (whether it is saturated or unsaturated/dry). THE DRY ADIABATIC LAPSE RATE DALR – Lapse rate for rising dry (unsaturated) air. Constant/fixed value of 1ºC/100 m (about 3ºC/1000 ft) THE SATURATED LAPSE RATE SALR – Lapse rate for rising saturated air. Constant/fixed value of 0.6ºC/100 m (about 1.8ºC/1000 ft) => Saturated air warms up at a slower rate than unsaturated/dry air! If the air continues to rise above its condensation level, it starts to cool down at the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate (1.8°C per 1 000 ft), which is lower than the DALR => because latent heat is released during the condensation process (warming up the surroundings) - thus the rate of cooling is slowed down. On the other hand, when saturated air descends it is warmed-up at a slower rate (SALR 1.8°C per 1 000 ft) than the dry air (DALR 3ºC per 1000 ft), because evaporation takes place during which latent heat is absorbed - thus slowing down the rate of warming of the parcel. SUMMARY: Rising unsaturated (dry) air cools down more rapidly than saturated (moist) air. Sinking unsaturated (dry) air warms-up more rapidly than saturated (moist) air.",

The temperature relationship between the air and the underlying surface helps determine the type of air mass. Here are the classifications based on this principle: Warm air mass: When the air is warmer than the surface below, it undergoes cooling from below and becomes stable. This stable air condition often leads to the formation of stratiform clouds (St and Sc) with cloud bases lower than the hilltops. This type of cloud formation can create hazardous conditions similar to fog. Cold air mass: When the air is colder than the surface below, it experiences heating from below, resulting in an unstable air mass.

Imagine a sponge that can absorb water. When it's completely dry, it can absorb a lot of water, but when it's already wet, it can't take in as much. Similarly, air can hold different amounts of water vapor depending on the temperature. The formula for relative humidity compares the actual amount of water vapor in the air (called the mixing ratio) to the maximum amount it could hold at that temperature (known as the saturation mixing ratio), expressed as a percentage. It's like comparing how much water the sponge currently has to how much it could hold when it's fully saturated. Relative Humidity (RH) = actual mixing ratio ÷ saturation mixing ratio x 100 So, relative humidity tells us how close the air is to being completely saturated with water vapor. If the relative humidity is high, it means the air is holding a lot of water vapor compared to its capacity, which might make it feel muggy or humid. If the relative humidity is low, it means the air is relatively dry, and there's plenty of room for more water vapor.",

            "explanation": "The term “adiabatic process” refers to the process of energy conversion in a volume of air without exchange of heat with the surroundings. We know that when a volume of a parcel of air changes the temperature changes. If the parcel of air is compressed, its temperature increases. If it is allowed to expand, its temperature decreases. This change of volume is most frequently caused by lifting the parcel of air or its subsidence. As a parcel of air is lifted to a higher level the pressure of its surrounding air decreases => the pressure inside this parcel of air is higher than its surrounding air => the parcel of air is allowed to expand => expansion results in lower temperature => parcel of air cools. This is the principle why temperature decreases with altitude. When parcel of air subsides (sinks) the opposite is true => it \"enters\" an area where the pressure of its surrounding air is higher => parcel of air is forced to compress => compression results in an increase of temperature. Saturation occurs when the actual water vapor content of a given parcel of air reaches the maximum value that the parcel of air can hold at the given temperature. We know that the capacity of air to hold water vapor is determined by its temperature. If the temperature is lowered to the point where the maximum water vapor holding capacity is reached or if water vapor is added and reached this \"maximum capacity\" value saturation occurs. Saturation is equivalent of 100% Relative Humidity (ratio of the actual water vapor content to the maximum possible water content capacity of the air). Cooling of the air beyond saturation point results in condensation = transformation of water vapor into liquid water - water droplets. Saturation can be achieved: by adding water vapor to the parcel of air and thus increasing the actual water vapor content, by decreasing the temperature of the air parcel (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion) and thus reducing its capability to hold water vapor, by combination of the above.",

The process that leads to saturation is influenced by various factors, but in this context, we'll focus on the options provided. a) \"Increasing the air pressure\": INCORRECT. While increasing air pressure can impact the air's capacity to hold water vapour, it does not directly lead to saturation. Higher pressure allows the air to hold more water vapour. b) \"Increasing the amount of water vapor in the air\": This is the CORRECT answer. When more water vapour is introduced into the air, it increases the humidity level. As the air accumulates water vapour, it approaches its saturation point. Once the air reaches this saturation point, further additions of water vapour will lead to condensation, forming clouds or precipitation. c) \"Increasing the temperature of the air\": INCORRECT. Raising the air temperature does not directly cause the air to become saturated. However, it is an essential factor in determining the air's capacity to hold water vapour. Warm air can accommodate more water vapour than cold air. As the temperature increases, the air can hold more moisture, thus reducing relative humidity - making saturation less likely. d) \"Decreasing the amount of water vapour in the air\": INCORRECT. Lowering the amount of water vapour in the air reduces the humidity level, making saturation less likely. The air becomes drier, it does not cause the air to become saturated. AIR BECOMES SATURATED: By adding more water vapour to it. As warm air can hold more water vapour than cold, saturation can be achieved by cooling the air (adiabatic cooling = adiabatic expansion = lifting the parcel to a higher level).

            "explanation": "“The actual temperature of an air mass is higher than the dew point temperature if the air mass is unsaturated.\" CORRECT Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. When the dew point temperature and air temperature are equal, the air is said to be saturated (relative humidity = 100%). Dew point temperature can never be greater than the air temperature. Therefore, if the air cools below the original dew point, moisture must be removed from the air and this is accomplished through condensation. Summary: • for unsaturated air – dew point is lower than air temperature; and • for saturated air – dew point is equal to air temperature. \"For a saturated air mass, the dew point temperature over ice is lower than the dew point temperature over water.\" INCORRECT This one is a bit more complicated, but in simple terms, if the air temperature is below the freezing point of water (0ºC) and therefore ice crystals can be formed instead of water droplets, then the air will favour the formation of ice. Due to the saturation vapour pressure over ice being lower than water, the amount of water vapour that can be held before forming ice crystals is LESS than can be held before forming water droplets. This means that ice crystals are formed earlier than water droplets, so ice has a HIGHER temperature frost point than water's dew point. (They have referred to \"dew point temperature over ice\" which is the same as \"frost point\").",

            "explanation": "The temperature lapse rate of air is the amount of temperature change the air experiences over a difference in height. There are a different lapse rates, depending on the situation. This question is simply asking about the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate) DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) - This is the amount of temperature that dry (non-saturated) air changes by if it rises or sinks in the atmosphere. Adiabatic means that no external temperatures affect it, and any parcel of dry air will conform to this DALR if moved up or down. The DALR is -3ºC/1000ft, meaning that for every 1 000 ft gained, a dry parcel of air will reduce in temperature by 3ºC. This happens because air rises into lower pressure, therefore expanding and making the molecules further apart, so less collisions occur and less heat is present. SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate) - This is the same concept as for the DALR, but has an added layer of complication. When saturated (Relative Humidity 100%) air rises, it will become cooler (as is standard due to expansion), but that means that the air can no longer hold as much water, so some water is released as condensation, turning into liquid water droplets. This process is going from a high energy state (water vapour) to a lower energy state (liquid), meaning that latent heat is released (see annex above). The release of latent heat adds temperature to the air, which gains back a little of the 3ºC lost per 1 000 ft (DALR). This means that saturated air does not lose heat as quickly with altitude as dry air does, but by how much depends on the heat of the air (and therefore the water content. More water to condense means that more energy is put into the atmosphere, so the air cools less, so the wetter air cools slower with altitude increase). For standard temperatures we say that the SALR is about -1.8ºC/1000ft, meaning that the water condensation releases 1.8ºC into the atmosphere every 1 000 ft. Sometimes lapse rates are measured in degrees (ºC) per 100 m, in which case, the DALR would be -1ºC/100m and the SALR would be -0.6ºC/100m on average (remember, the SALR can change). ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) - This is the ACTUAL change in temperature throughout the atmosphere, measured by a radiosonde. The ELR decides whether pockets of air that moves upwards or downwards will be unstable or stable, as the ELR dictates what the moving air will have to compare its temperature to (read up on stability for more explanation).",

Note: Dew Point temperature is the temperature a parcel of air needs to be cooled to become saturated. As we can observe in the graph, this condition happens at point 4, where the lines intercept – condensation level is reached. It means that below the condensation level (point 4), the air parcel remains dry/unsaturated and, therefore, when forced to rise, it will cool down at the Dry Adiabatic Lapse rate (which is depicted by green line). Above the condensation level (point 4), on the other hand, the air is saturated. And as long as this air inside the cloud remains warmer than the surroundings, it will continue to rise. Up to the cloud top, the air parcel remains saturated and when rising, it cools down at the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse rate. CONCLUSION: First, the dry air parcel will rise and cool at the DALR (green line) => point 3 Until it reaches the condensation level => point 4 After the condensation level, it will rise and cool at the SALR (red line) => point 6",

Thus, we begin our recipe by collecting sufficient water vapour - that we will soon transform into the liquid or solid states. The water vapor content of the atmosphere varies from near zero to about 5 percent, depending on the moisture on the surface beneath and the air temperature. Next, we need some dust (Micrometric solid particles). Without \"dirty air\" there would likely be no clouds at all or only high altitude ice clouds. Even the \"cleanest\" air found on Earth contains about 1000 dust particles per cubic meter of air. Dust is needed for condensation nuclei, sites on which water vapor may condense or deposit as a liquid or solid. Without a nuclei for water to condense onto, air has been known to become “supersaturated” with water in lab conditions, up to 400% of the usual maximum humidity. With proper quantities of water vapor and dust in an air parcel, the next step is for the air parcel mass to be cooled to a temperature at which cloud droplets or ice crystals can form (dew point).",

Isothermal layers often occur in the low levels of the troposphere during a differential advection situation. The air within an isothermal layer is stable. To cause air in an isothermal layer to rise it must be forced lifted since it will not rise on its own. Stability of the atmosphere can be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. Because in an isothermal layer the temperature does not change with altitude, the ELR is 0 and thus less than the SALR. That is why an isothermal layer is absolutely stable.",

            "explanation": "HUMIDITY is a measurement of the amount of water vapour in the air. Humidity Measurement Absolute Humidity Refers to the amount of water contained in a parcel of air. Usually expressed in g/m3 Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR) Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature. Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR) The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel. Expressed as g/kg of dry air. Relative Humidity (RH) The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage. Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air. RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100 RH 100% = Saturation Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated. From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa. Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases. Note: Dew point is a more reliable indicator of humidity than relative humidity because dew point is not affected by a change in air temperature and doesn’t fluctuate much throughout the day.",

Usually expressed in g/m3 Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR) Maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry air can hold at a specified temperature. Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR) The ratio of the mass of water vapour present relative to the mass of dry air in the air parcel. Expressed as g/kg of dry air. Relative Humidity (RH) The ratio of the amount of water vapor actually present in the air to the greatest amount possible at the same temperature, expressed as percentage. Depends on moisture content and the temperature of the air. RH = (HMR/SMR) x 100 RH 100% = Saturation Now, let’s talk about Relative Humidity in more detail. As we have discussed above, RH depends on moisture content and temperature. In simple words, it is given as a percentage and tells you how close the air is to being saturated. Consequently, if the relative humidity is 100%, the air is saturated. If the relative humidity is 50%, the air contains half the water vapor required for it to be saturated. From the formula, we can say that, if the amount of water vapour in the air increases, the relative humidity increases, and vice versa. Relative humidity is dependent on air temperature, too. As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, therefore, if the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases. On the other hand, since colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air, if temperature drops, relative humidity increases.",

EXPANSION. In the atmosphere, pressure decreases as altitude increases. Now, imagine an isolated parcel of air moving vertically through the troposphere. As altitude increases, the pressure exerted on the parcel decreases and the parcel expands in volume as a result. In order to expand (do work), the parcel must use its internal energy to do so. As the air expands, the molecules spread out and ultimately collide less with one another. The work of expansion causes the air’s temperature to decrease. => If the moist unsaturated parcel of air expands and cools to the dew point temperature - saturation will occur",

            "explanation": "A very large factor in the formation of turbulence is the atmospheric stability. In essence, stability is the measurement of how air reacts to being forced upwards. If air is forced to rise by some force, once the force disappears, stable air will begin to sink back to the original altitude, and unstable air will continue to rise. This is all to do with the temperature of the different layers of atmosphere, called the Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR). If there is a high ELR, then the atmosphere drops in temperature with altitude quite rapidly. If there is a low ELR, it means that the temperature does not drop as quickly with altitude, and even an ELR of 0 (an isothermal layer) or an increase of temperature with altitude (an inversion) can also occur. The air which is forced to rise will not change temperature at the ELR though, it changes temperature with the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate = 3ºC/1000ft) when unsaturated, or the SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate [variable, usually around 1.8ºC/1000ft; always less than the DALR]) when fully saturated with water vapour. If this makes the air parcel warmer than the surrounding atmosphere, then the atmosphere is unstable, and will rise, and the opposite for if it becomes cooler than the atmosphere. This creates 3 regions of stability: Absolute stability, when the ELR is less than the SALR. Conditional stability, when the ELR is between the SALR and the DALR. (saturated air is unstable but dry air is stable in this atmosphere) Absolute instability, when the ELR is greater than the DALR. A good way to remember which way round these are is that isothermal layers and inversions are always absolutely stable, and act like an air blockade. Stability causes less uplift in the atmosphere, allowing for smoother flying conditions with less turbulence which is when the ELR is less than the SALR. Realistically there is no need to look at the figure in the question, the E sector does appear to be unstable but the question would have the same answer if no figure were presented.",

Having fast airflow over a mountain causes a lot of vertical movement of air, with large updrafts on the windward side of the mountain as the air climbs, as well as large downdrafts on the lee side where the air descends back to the surface. These \"mountain waves\" often continue downwind of the high ground similar to waves on the ocean, and can have this up and down \"wave\" motion for hundreds of miles in some cases. The downdrafts within these waves can be so powerful that lower performance aircraft may not be able to climb at all when within one. Mountain waves (or standing waves) are therefore very dangerous to aircraft, and if the right conditions exist, mountain waves can continue as high as the tropopause in some cases. There are some tell-tale signs of mountain waves though. Lenticular clouds (cloud type lenticularis) are clouds which are shaped like a lens, and they stay in the same location, even though the wind in their location is strong. They are indicative of the presence of mountain waves, and look very smooth, but actually contain lots of windshear and turbulence nearby and within them. Wind rotors exist in the region of lenticular clouds, and sometimes have associated roll/rotor clouds, which are also indicative of severe turbulence.",

Please send us any further feedback you can remember from the real exam via the comments, your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can verify and improve the question, thank you! A Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) is the type that forms storms. For a CB to form, there must be three things; instability, moisture, and a trigger (something which forces air to rise). When the cloud forms and the air is rising in an unstable air mass, the rising air does not cool down at the same rate as the surrounding environment, and this is what we call instability. This means that the rising air wants to continue rising with more and more velocity. When instability and moisture are great enough, these clouds can form large CBs, which continue to accelerate as long as instability exists. If the air becomes more stable, then the cloud's development will slow down (as it no longer has as much of a temperature difference with the surrounding air. This is most commonly seen at the tropopause, where the surrounding air temperature stops changing (an isothermal layer), and all CBs are stopped at the tropopause, flowing outwards to form an \"anvil\" shape (sometimes overshooting with a small \"hat\" from the excess velocity). Isothermal layers are inherently very stable, as the rising air cools as it rises, so will never be the same temperature as air which remains the same temperature. This means that inversions are even more stable. Stability is based on the environmental lapse rate (ELR - the rate at which the surrounding air cools with temperature) vs the Dry or Wet Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR or SALR) of the rising parcel of air. The DALR is constant and the SALR is close to constant, but the ELR varies massively. The greater the ELR (greater temperature drop per 1000 ft), the less stable the atmosphere. When the ELR is 0 (isothermal layer), or an inversion occurs, the air is absolutely stable. A strong inversion in the mid layers of the troposphere (so 10 - 20,000 ft) would stop a CB's development very quickly indeed. All of a sudden, the rising air in the CB would not be warmer than the surrounding air, and would stop or sink instead of rising. The cloud would have no further development above this point.",

            "explanation": "STEAM FOG (ARCTIC SEA SMOKE). occurs over sea, mainly in polar regions. It is caused when low-level cold air from a land mass moves over a (comparatively) warmer sea (water surface) = advection of very cold air over a warm sea. The small amount of evaporation from the sea in the cold air just above it is enough to cause saturation and condensation. Steam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. It forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. It will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or change of direction. It will also be dispersed if the water becomes colder or the air becomes warmer (the temperature difference reduces). To look at each option: \"Radiation cooling and the creation of a ground inversion.\" This means that the low-level air is getting colder, which would not dissipate the sea smoke. \"Calm winds, allowing the build-up of high-level stratus clouds.\" Calm winds allow the formation of sea smoke, and high level clouds do not really affect it. \"Inflow of warm air at higher levels, reducing relative humidity.\" High level changes do not affect sea smoke formation/dissipation. It is a low-level phenomenon only. \"Inflow of unstable air, dissipating any surface inversion.\" This is correct. Unstable air without a surface inversion will be warmer near the surface, so the sea smoke will dissipate as the air temperature rises above the dewpoint.",

As the warm air rises, it cools adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), and when it reaches its dew point temperature (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture), water vapor starts to condense into tiny water droplets. These droplets cluster together to form visible cumulus clouds. These clouds can grow rapidly, when the atmosphere is unstable, with no upper-air inversion, and may develop into cumulonimbus clouds, with their tops reaching the tropopause. The vertical extent of cumulus clouds is limited by the stability of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is stable, meaning that the temperature increases with height (inversion). A subsidence inversion occurs when there is a layer of sinking or subsiding air in the atmosphere. This sinking air warms adiabatically (without heat exchange) as it descends, causing a temperature increase with height. This warm layer acts as a lid or cap on the rising warm air, preventing it from ascending further.",

            "explanation": "FRONTAL FOG. Occurs most often at a warm front or occlusion. It is most commonly caused by the evaporation of warm rain falling into colder, drier air beneath. It also exists from the gradual reduction of cloud base to the surface, which is also considered fog. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only a few hours before the front passes and it clears. Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the front (due to increasing temperatures and surface winds). As this question eludes to, the fog may not disappear immediately after the surface front passes, as the \"low cloud\" which we class as fog may be still yet to pass, so the fog will likely dissipate over a few minutes. Note: There is conflicting feedback on this question, and whilst we think the current correct answer is most correct, we disagree with the wording slightly, that the fog would clear only \"slowly\" after the front has passed. Any further exam feedback (including the exam authority if possible) would be very useful to verify the correct answer.",

For this to happen, the parcel of air must be saturated (Relative Humidity = 100%) - which means that the air parcel is unable to hold all the water it contains in vapour form, so it starts to condense. There are two ways by which saturation is reached: (a) By increasing the water content in the air. I.e. through evaporation, to a point where the air can hold no more.

When temperature rises during the day, dew point spread will increase and cloud base will be higher. When Relative Humidity is low, you would expect a HIGH cloud base. On the other hand, a lower difference between temperature and dew point (and, consequently, High Relative Humidity), leads to a LOWer cloud base. To calculate cloud tops, we need to know the SALR and ELR => cloud tops are located where SALR meets ELR. Why? Because air in clouds is rising with SALR - air is saturated (moist). Saturated air cools down slower and as long as enough moisture is available the cloud will keep growing. When SALR = ELR (temperature of air parcel in cloud = temperature of environment) the parcel of air cannot ascend (rise) any more because there is no difference in temperature (no difference in density). Hence, top of clouds is defined.",

Frontal fog is a term that can be used to describe any fog that was caused by frontal activity, so includes the \"hill fog\" mentioned in the question, which is actually just cloud that is low enough to touch the high ground. The more common definition of frontal fog is a special type of fog that only happens under a warm front, just before it passes. Before a warm front passes, we are in a cold sector, so the air is cold, and therefore the ground is relatively cold as well. There is, however, warmer rain falling from above, at least towards the latter stages of the front passing. This is warm rain falling through cold air, and tends to bring a high amount of humidity to the air it goes through. This humidity is most when the warm rain hits the cold ground and begins to evaporate. At this point, we have a lot of humidity in cold air, which leads to the air becoming quickly saturated, and frontal fog is formed. Sometimes this is complemented by stratus fractus, which are small patches of stratus cloud that hang in the air.",

If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. TURBULENCE INVERSION - often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then exists. SUBSIDENCE INVERSION - develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and, as a result, the lapse rate of temperature is reduced. If the air mass sinks low enough, the air at higher altitudes becomes warmer than at lower altitudes, producing a temperature inversion. FRONTAL INVERSION - occurs when a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass and lifts it aloft; the front between the two air masses then has warm air above and cold air below.",

CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR RADIATION FOG TO FORM Clear sky - increases the rate of terrestrial radiation and cooling of the ground. High relative humidity - little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and condensation. Calm or very light wind – which will result in rapid cooling. 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence => promotes a thicker layer. Surface - only occurs over land, because ground surface is a better heat conductor than sea surface.",

The trigger for the formation of cumulus clouds is heating from below. This heating can occur due to the warming of the Earth's surface by sunlight. As the surface heats up, it warms the air above it. When this warm air rises, it cools and condenses to form cumulus clouds. The vertical growth of cumulus clouds is restricted by a subsidence inversion. A subsidence inversion occurs when descending air in the atmosphere creates a layer of warmer air above cooler air. This layer acts as a barrier to vertical air movement, preventing further upward growth of the cumulus cloud. It inhibits the vertical development of the cloud, leading to the characteristic flattened appearance of cumulus clouds.",

They are fairly distinct and easy to classify in relation to other clouds: they’re a cumulus cloud that’s wider than tall. They’re flattened cumulus and are generally found low in altitude. Its vertical growth is usually restricted by the existence of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere - cooling of the surface stops convection and increases stability in the airmass which causes clouds to dissipate. Within the cloud, ascending currents of about 2–5 m/s (7–17 ft/s) may be encountered. Turbulence is sometimes severe, especially during the formation and growth of the cloud, and it diminishes when the cloud is mature. Air below the cloud base can be quite turbulent due to the thermals that formed the clouds, giving occupants of light aircraft an uncomfortable ride. To avoid turbulence where such clouds are present, pilots may climb above the cloud tops.",

It is caused when cold air (usually from a land mass) moves over a (comparatively) warmer sea = advection of very cold air over warm water. The small amount of evaporation from the sea is enough to cause saturation and condensation in the air close to the surface. A surface inversion has to be in place (and is usually because of cooling from the cold land mass) so this sea smoke does not continue rising into clouds. Steam fog is typically up to 500 feet thick and may drift inland. Forms in conditions of no wind or very light winds. Will be dispersed by an increase/decrease in wind speed or certain change of wind direction. Whereas clouds and fog are usually formed due to cooling of air, this is a case of fog being formed by increasing the humidity of the air. The best way to remember sea smoke is to think of a hot tub in a very cold climate, it forms \"steam fog\" in the same way that sea smoke occurs, just with a bigger temperature difference.",

Additionally, \"NSC\" indicates that there are no significant clouds. The wind direction is 220º at 5 KT. The temperature and dew point are both reported as 03/03, which indicated high relative humidity. Fog is indicated in the METAR as \"FG\" when visibility is less than 1 000 meters due to water droplets. It is most commonly radiation fog, formed through ground cooling at night. Radiation fog typically has a shallow vertical extent, up to a few hundred feet. It requires a clear sky, high relative humidity, and light wind (2-8 knots) to form. The clear sky enhances terrestrial radiation, high humidity enables condensation, and light wind prevents fog droplets from settling and helps bring warmer air to the ground, thickening the fog.",

They become supercooled water droplets remaining liquid even though they are below freezing temperature. This occurs because liquid needs a surface to freeze upon. When droplets from freezing fog freeze onto surfaces, a white deposit of feathery ice crystals is formed.

Formed due to evaporation and following condensation of warm falling precipitation down in a cold moist layer ahead of a warm front. It is formed by day and night. The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. - unless the front is a very slow moving one, the fog is typically present for only about 2 to 3 hours. Orographic lifting => increases the fog intensity Dissipation of frontal fog: by passing of the front Note: Frontal fog does not form ahead of cold fronts, because the rain and showers connected with a cold front are made up of drops that are too large, they have a high falling speed and at the same time the temperature of the drops is low.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments, via the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The question makes it clear that the cloud on the left is a different one to that of the CB with an anvil, but we are unsure of the altitude we are cruising at, and the description is quite confusing. The word \"fluffy\" that could refer to cumuliform clouds (or any clouds up close really), but this rather contradicts the word \"consistent\", which refers more to stratiform clouds. If we are at high altitude, then the clouds described could well be any form of Cirrus, Cirrostratus. At medium levels, it could be altostratus, and at low levels, we are not really sure which clouds could fit this description (perhaps cumulus, depending on how you consider the word \"consistent\"). In the end, we cannot really identify the exact cloud from this question, so we have to work off its features and which answer best fits those features. Nonetheless, let's assume high or medium levels for now (we are in the cruise, so these are most likely), and look through the options: \"Heavy drizzle\" This is not correct as the cloud is fully white, which usually means that it is not rain bearing. \"Severe turbulence and icing\" These effects are only experienced in CBs or large TCUs, and the question makes it clear that this cloud is not one of those. \"Clear and calm weather conditions.\" Whilst this could be somewhat correct when it comes to precipitation and turbulence, we would say that the word \"clear\" is contradictory, as how can a cloud be \"clear weather conditions\"? There is also nothing to say that the wind is calm (i.e. nil wind), if that is what they mean by \"calm\". \"No specific weather related effects.\" In the case of cirrus, cirrostratus, or even some altostratus, there are no undue effects from flying through these clouds. Some altostratus may contain the possibility for icing though, due to their level. Therefore, we think this is the most correct of the current options.",

Once all the moisture has condensed, cloud formation ceases. However, the presence of an inversion, often referred to as an isothermal layer, disrupts this upward motion. Inversions occur when the rising air encounters a layer of air that is warmer, causing it to halt its ascent. Consequently, inversions frequently cap clouds and fog layers. Moreover, an inversion inhibits the vertical movement of other atmospheric particles contained within the air pocket. As a result, an area above an inversion layer typically remains clear of clouds, smog, mist, and haze, among other things. In addition, there is an increase in wind speed above the inversion compared to just below it, resulting in significant wind shear at the inversion layer.",

Colder than the dew point of the air moving over it – to ensure condensation. HUMID AIR. High relative humidity – so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent condensation. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE. The greater the temperature difference between the warmer air and the colder ground => the greater the likelihood of fog formation. Note:“Radiation fog” INCORRECT. Only occurs over land. “Steam fog” INCORRECT. Advection of cold air over relatively warmer water.",

Basically, up and down currents within clouds, which lead to their vertical development, are decided by humidity and temperature differences (between the cloud and the surroundings) - if the air temperature is equal or higher than the cloud's temperature, clouds will stop growing. In simple words, a temperature inversion is a thin layer of the atmosphere where the normal decrease in temperature with height switches to the temperature increasing with height. It acts like a lid, keeping normal convective overturning of the atmosphere from penetrating through the inversion. Some of the effects it might have: An inversion might cause clouds just below the inversion to spread out and take on a flattened appearance. Still another effect is to prevent thunderstorms from forming. Even in an air mass that is hot and humid in the lowest layers, thunderstorms will be prevented if an inversion in the lower atmosphere is keeping this air from rising. The conceptual opposite of a temperature inversion is an unstable air layer.",
