If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (7/41) x 60 = 10º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (7/41) x 60 = 10º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 10º + 10º = 20º R The aircraft is left off-track, the aircraft must fly right to regain track.",

Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading. From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 004º 001ºW 003º 5ºW 358º",

WCA is of equal amount with the drift, but it has opposite direction. For example, when drift is 4oL, the WCA that must be made is 4oR. At this question, you have to distinguish the pre-flight with the actual data. The pre-flight WCA is 8oL, because the pilot was expecting a drift of 8oR due to the wind. But the actual drift is not 8oR as expected, but it is 2o more to the right, 10o R. Therefore, the actual track of the a/c will be also 2o more to the right in comparison with the planned track.

The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration. Dead reckoning is subject to cumulative errors. Advances in navigational aids that give accurate information on position, in particular satellite navigation using the Global Positioning System, have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, inertial navigation systems, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied. By analogy with their navigational use, the words dead reckoning are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities. Accuracy of DR depends on many factors: 1- Time since last position update. 2- Meteorological accuracy of the forecasted wind. 3- Accuracy of heading and speed (GS) flown. 4- Knowledge of pilots in Navigation.",

The second correction that must be so as to intercept position B, is given by the 1:60 rule based formula: (Distance off track / Miles to go) = (Degrees to intercept / 60). Solving for Degrees to intercept we get: Degrees to intercept = (Distance off track x 60) / Miles to go = (3 NM x 60) / (75 NM - 45 NM) = 6o left.

In our case, the altitude ½ from FL 290 to MSL is FL145 or 14,500 ft. Air temperature at FL145 in ISA conditions is: 15oC - (2oC x 14,500/1,000) = -14oC, but with average ISA deviation -8oC (air is colder by 8oC), the actual air temperature is: -14oC - 8oC = -22oC. Using the airspeed correction window of your nav computer, find the TAS at 14,500 ft. 1. Align Pressure altitude 14,500 feet with actual air temperature -22oC. 2. Opposite CAS 250 kt (inner disc), read TAS 308 kt (outer disc). Using the wind side of your nav computer find the Groundspeed, with TAS: 308 kt, Track: 210o(T) and W/V at 14,500: 310°(T)/45 kt. Set wind direction to 310º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 308 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 210º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 8ºL drift and a track of 202º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 210º. This occurs at a heading of 218º with 9ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 315 kt.",

The 1:60 rule states that: \"For each degree of drift angle you will be one NM off-track having travelled 60 NM along track\". If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM. If so, 2 NM off-track must equate to a 6º drift angle and 3 NM off-track must equate to a 9º drift angle. For this question, the aircraft experiences the 2.4 NM off-track distance between the lake and the track, 11 minutes from the previous waypoint. So, the distance from the previous waypoint until the aircraft flies above the small lake is: Distance = GS x Flight time = 115 kt x 11/60 hr = 21 NM. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which is off-track 2.4 NM after 60 NM, will have a drift angle of 2.4º. Thus, after 21 NM, the aircraft will have a drift angle of: 2.4º x 2.86 (60/21)= 7º (rounded).",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS decrease. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 264 kt and a TAS of 365 kt, at a higher altitude during the climb, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be lower. Therefore, the option that gives both a CAS less than 264 kt and a TAS less than 365 kt is TAS at 356 kt and CAS at 233 kt.",

Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

Accuracy of DR depends on: Time elapsed since last fix; Accuracy of the wind velocity used; Accuracy of headings and airspeeds; Skill and knowledge of the pilot. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.

The Height difference is: 18 000 ft - 3 000 ft = 15 000 ft. So, solving for Glidepath Angle, we get: Glidepath Angle(o) = (Height difference (ft) x 60) / Covered Distance (ft) = 15 000 ft x 60 / (25 x 6080 ) ft = 5.9o. The Groundspeed is: TAS + Tailwind component = 130 kt + 30 kt = 160 kt. Thus, ROD = (Glide Angle/60) x (Groundspeed/60) x 6080 = (5.9/60) x (160/60) x 6080 = 1 594 ft/min, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 3: For a 3o glideslope angle only, the following formula states: ROD = 5 x GS = 5 x 160 = 800 fpm. Thus, for a 5.9o glideslope angle, the ROD will be: 800 fpm x 5.9o / 3o = 1 573 fpm, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 4 (using your Flight/Nav computer): Set the glide path angle 5.9º(59) over 60. Read out the ROD 1 600 ft/min (16) approximately over the GS 160 kt (16).",

Consequently, utilizing interpolation, we deduce: With an 8 000 ft increase in pressure altitude, wind direction decreases by 10°. With a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind direction decreases by x°. Calculating: x = (10° x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 8.75° ⇒ wind direction at FL170: 310° - 8.75° = 301.25°. Similarly, For an 8000 ft pressure altitude increase, wind velocity increases by 15 kt. For a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind velocity increases by y kt. Computing: y = (15 kt x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 13.125 kt ⇒ wind velocity at FL170: 5 kt + 13.125 kt = 18.125 kt. Consequently, the wind parameters at FL170 are: 301.25°/18.125 kt.

We will keep them in Magnetic for now, and remember to apply the variation to our calculated wind velocity at the end (it reduces the number of calculations slightly this way). The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (low speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (156º) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (179 kt) under the central point Note the drift to the track (TRK = 150º, so drift = 6º Left) and place a dot where that drift line meets the groundspeed (191 kt). (we have shown a line for better viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre, and place the central dot over the zero point near the bottom of the slider. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top and the wind speed as the value under the dot that you added. Our magnetic wind velocity is 275º(M)/23 kt.

(2) Place wind direction (020º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (60 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (070º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (483 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 442 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => approx. 6ºL. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, heading = TT - 6ºL = 070º - 6ºL = 064º Determine the magnetic heading: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

It also refers to the plane of this path and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent orbit of the Sun around the Earth. The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to this orbital path at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth’s equator is 23.5o. When we are at the Equator, the daylight does not vary significantly over the year, whereas if we are near the poles, the difference between summer and winter is very dramatic. When looking at total sunlight received, the poles generally have lower sunlight, because even in their summer, there is much lower land area relative to the equator. The tilt of the Earth of the Earth’s axis also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day except at high latitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of year higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter. The reason for the variation of the duration of daylight throughout the year is the inclination of the Earth’s axis of rotation to the ecliptic. Therefore, Cambridge, which has a relatively high latitude (52oN) will have more hours of daylight on the 1st July and fewer hours of daylight on the 1st January.",

Track Error Angle (TKE) is the angle from the planned track to the actual track. Don’t confuse Drift with TKE: TKE is NOT drift. \"3 NM off-course towards the North\" for an eastwards direction means \"Distance off-course to the left\". The TKE is given by the formula: TKE = (Distance off course x 60) / Distance travelled= (3 NM x 60) / 20NM = 9o Left. So, the Actual track is: 104o(T) - 9oL = 095o(T). Therefore, the aircraft's Drift is: Heading - Actual track = 099o(T) - 095o(T) = 4o Left.",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant CAS, both TAS and Mach speed increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the climb the instruments' cross-check shows TAS at 336 kt and Mach speed 0.55, at FL280 both TAS and Mach speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and Mach speed higher than 336 kt and 0.55 correspondingly, is TAS 357 kt and Mach 0.59.",

So its actual Groundspeed is: GS = Distance / Time = 37 NM / (14/60) = 158 kt. Thus, it covers the distance of 50 NM from the aerodrome to the turning point in: Time = Distance / GS = 50 NM / 158 = 0.31 hr or 19 min. Therefore, the aircraft's Estimated Time of Arrival at the turning point will be: 22:14 + 19 min = 22:33. But the aircraft is not above overhead the aerodrome as planned, but 5 NM right off it, because the wind is not as forecast. Using your Navigation/Flight computer follow the steps below: Firstly, find the Track Error Angle, which is also the degrees to parallel: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance gone 37 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to parallel 8.1o (81) on the outer scale. Secondly, find the degrees to intercept at the next turning point: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance to go 50 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to get back to track at the turning point 6o (60) on the outer scale. Thus, the total correction to the heading must be: 8.1o + 6o = 14.1o. And since the aircraft is off track to the right, the total correction to the heading must be to the left. Therefore, the heading to intercept the turning point must be: 175o - 14.1o = 160.9o, which is close to 161o.",

Degrees to intercept position B: Align distance off, 4 NM (40) outer scale, with distance to go, 60 NM inner scale. Above the black arrow (60), read the degrees to intercept: 4° (40) on outer scale.

This solution has a few parts to it, so we will take you through the planning and then the actual calculations. Working backwards, we have a heading and TAS from the OFP, so need the actual track (Track Made Good, TMG) and groundspeed (GS) of the aircraft from Fruges windfarm to Wimereux. The ATA of 14:43 allows us to calculate the GS, and the position 1 NM right of Wimereux allows us to calculate the TMG. Groundspeed The ATA (Actual Time of Arrival) abeam Wimereux was 14:43, making the leg 12 minutes long from the ATA at the previous waypoint (14:31). The distance of the leg is 23 NM. 12 minutes long is 12/60 = 0.2 hours. Groundspeed (kt) = Ground Distance (NM) / time (hours) Groundspeed = 23 NM / 0.2 = 115 kt Track Made Good (TMG) 1 NM off track over a 23 NM leg distance, we can use the 1 in 60 rule to calculate the angle of drift off the expect track. 1 x (60/23) = 2.6° right of planned track. This gives a true track for that leg of 310° + 2.6° = 312.6°, but for further calculation we will just use TMG = 313° Wind Calculation (we have used the CRP-5 and wind-down method) With your flight computer on the wind side, set the true heading to 300° and the centre point over the TAS of 110 kt. Then make a mark where the line of 13° right drift (corresponding to the TMG of 313°) and the Groundspeed of 115 kt meet. Take this point and place it directly underneath the centre dot, then you may take the centre dot to the top of the vertical grid section and read off the wind direction and strength. All directions were in \"true\" so no variation required. The wind component is closest to 205°(T)/25 kt.",

Then, find the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 210 kt on the inner scale. Finally, read the True Airspeed (TAS) on the outer scale opposite the CAS of 210 kt on the inner scale. In this case, the True Airspeed (TAS) is 275 kt. Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: Move the slide until the center dot falls on the arc marked i.e. 275 (you can choose any arc you like as this will not affect the final result, we choose the TAS). Next, rotate the window disc to align the True Wind Direction (050°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. Draw a downward line starting from the ring along the centerline, with a length equal to the Wind Velocity (40 kt). Then, rotate the window disc to align the True Track (270°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. The end of the line should be approximately 5° to the Left of the centerline, which corresponds to a 5° Left (Port) Drift Angle. Therefore, WCA is 5ºR. To determine the Ground Speed, find the speed arc that passes under the end of the line drawn. In this case, the Ground Speed is 305 kt. Wind Correction Angle is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track. In this case, the WCA is 5º R (drift is 5ºL), the true heading = 270º + 5º = 275º (T). Let's determine the Magnetic Heading: True heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass heading (C) 275º 7ºE 268º Variation West, Magnetic Best. Variation East, Magnetic Least. Assuming a Ground Speed of 305 kt, which is equivalent to 305/60 NM/min, the time required to travel a distance of 300 NM can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance/Ground Speed In this case, the time would be (300 x 60) / 305 min = 59 min Given that the Time of Departure is 10:15 UTC and the estimated flight time is 59 min, the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) can be calculated as 10:15 UTC + 00:59 = 11:14 UTC.",

It is important to note that, as altitude increases, the air distance increases and so does the difference between the air distance and the ground distance - this is due to the curvature of the Earth.

Therefore, we need to calculate the True Heading. To calculate the True Heading, both the Track and the Wind Direction must be referenced to the same North (either True or Magnetic). We will be converting the Track from Magnetic to True. By considering the provided magnetic variation: Variation = 5º W ⇒ Variation West, Magnetic Best ⇒ True Track = Magnetic Track - 005º = 007º - 005º = 002º. Given that True Track = 002º, TAS = 445 kt, and W/V: 050º/40 kt, we can use a flight computer to determine the true heading: Rotate the window disc until the True Wind Direction (050º) aligns below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Commencing from the center dot, draw an upward line along the centerline, with a length equivalent to the Wind Velocity (40 kt) - if you use TAS as reference, mark wind speed up from 445 kt, 485 kt. Rotate the window disc until the True Track (002º) falls below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Shift the slide until the center dot aligns with the arc corresponding to the True Airspeed (445 kt). Wind correction angle reads between centre line and Wind speed Mark => 4°R. 4ºR WCA means that the aircraft is experiencing a 4ºL drift. Therefore, Heading = Track + drift = 002°+ 004°= 006° Finally, applying the relationship above, we obtain: True Bearing from the aircraft to the Locator PY (at 1 003 UTC) = 266º + 006º = 272º.",

Thus, a distance of 500 NM along a meridian corresponds to 500' change of latitude or 8° 20'. Therefore, as it flies south on the northern hemisphere, its latitude will decrease, provided that it does not cross the Equator. Its new latitude at B point, after 500 NM south off A point, will be: 26°06'N - 8° 20' = 17°46'N. After B point, the aircraft continues eastwards (i.e. along the same parallel of latitude) for 500 NM along the 17°46'N parallel of latitude. The distance along a parallel of latitude is called \"Departure\" and is given by the formula: Departure(NM) = Change of Longitude(min) x cos Lat. Solving for Change of Longitude we get: Change of Longitude(min) = Departure(NM) / cos Lat = 500 NM / cos 17°46' = 525 or 8° 45'. Therefore, its new longitude, after 500 NM east off B point, will be: 004°11' + 8° 45' = 012°56' E. Finally, C position's coordinates will be: 17°46'N 012°56' E.",

Solar energy is created at the core of the Sun and hits the Earth with an intensity depending on its angle of arrival. The angle of arrival at any point, as a result of the Earth's axis inclination in relation to the plane of rotation, is dependent on its latitude, the season, as the Earth axis tilts in relation to the Sun and the time of day. Also, the Earth's axis inclination in relation to the plane of rotation around the Sun, is responsible for the changing duration of the daylight throughout the year at mid and high latitudes. When the northern hemisphere is tilted most towards the Sun, it experiences northern hemisphere summer, when it tilts most away, it experiences northern hemisphere winter, but southern hemisphere summer. The tilt of the Earth’s axis also accounts for longer nights in winter and longer days in summer.",

The question provides a lot of data, but to find the True Airspeed (TAS), we only need the Ground Speed (GS) and the wind component. With a headwind, the TAS is higher than the GS because the wind is slowing you down. Therefore, you add the headwind component to the GS. With a tailwind, the TAS is lower than the GS because the wind is pushing you faster. Therefore, you subtract the tailwind component from the GS. Here's the formula to calculate TAS: TAS = GS ± Headwind/Tailwind Component - Use the plus sign if it’s a headwind (wind blowing against the direction of travel). - Use the minus sign if it’s a tailwind (wind blowing in the same direction as travel). Given: Ground Speed (GS) = 485 knots Headwind Component = 25 knots Since it's a headwind, you add the headwind component to the ground speed to find the TAS. TAS = GS + Headwind Component TAS = 485 kt + 25 kt TAS = 510 kt",

The interpolated values are approximately 191º/39 kt. While none of the available options precisely match these interpolated values, the most suitable choice from the provided answers would be 205º/40 kt for wind speed. To break down the interpolation: Interpolation: FL250: 190/40 FL180: 200/30 During a 7 000 ft descent (from 25 000 ft to 18 000 ft), the wind direction veered by 10º. Therefore, in a 500 ft interval, the wind would change by approximately 1º (191º). Similarly, during the same 7 000 ft descent, the wind speed decreased by 10 kt. Hence, in a 500 ft interval, the wind speed would decrease by roughly 1 kt (39 kt). Consequently, the most appropriate wind estimate, given these considerations, would be 205º/40 kt.",

The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: [2/3 x (8 000 - 4 000)] ft + 4 000 ft= 6 667 ft. 2. With the data given, we cannot find the W/V at 4 000 ft and interpolate with the W/V at 8 000 ft for the 2/3 of the cruising altitude, but we can find through the flight/nav computer, the GS at 8 000 ft and interpolate with the GS given at 4 000 ft for the 2/3: Set wind direction to 200º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 240 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 259º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 241º with 8ºR drift. The groundspeed at 8 000 ft for this track is approximately 208 kt. 3. After interpolation, the GS at 2/3 of the cruising altitude (6 667 ft) is: 212 kt. 4.

It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3.

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 090º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 086º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 090º. This occurs at a heading of 094º with 5ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 130 kt. GS = 130 kts Planned track distance flown = 130 x 15 min = 32.5 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 32.5 + 2.5 = 35 NM. Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 35 TKE = 5° If we alter our heading by 5° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination.

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least The relationship between the different directions can be expressed by the following table: True Heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic Heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass Heading (C) 356º 5ºW 001º 1ºW 002º Note: The TVMDC table can be used to relate both Heading directions or track directions.",

Thus, the required Descent Gradient is: % Gradient = 27 500 ft x 100 / (75 NM x 6080 ft) = 6.03 %, which is very close to 6.1 %.",

At a height the air density reduces and therefore the same dynamic pressure reflects a higher TAS. The same thing would happen, if the air was warmer than standard. Conversely, at a lower height or in colder air than standard, the same dynamic presssure reflects a lower TAS. This means that at height we have two airspeeds, the CAS based on dynamic pressure and the higher TAS than CAS through the air. As an aircraft descends from one altitude to one other lower with constant CAS, but higher to Sea Level, the TAS will be in both cases higher than the CAS, but the difference between them increases as altitude increases and decreases as altitude decreases, until they become equal at Sea Level in ISA conditions. For this question, the TAS will be always higher than CAS during the descent (thus, 119 kt is excluded), but a few minutes later, after FL080, the TAS will be lower than 135 kt, 131 kt.",

The altitude change in the climb is 30 000 - 3 000 = 27 000 ft. 2/3 x 27 000 ft = 18 000 ft. 18 000 ft through the climb occurs at 3 000 + 18 000 = 21 000 ft. We must therefore interpolate the wind halfway between FL180 and FL 240. As the wind velocities here are close together in direction and speed, we can do this mathematically by averaging the direction and speed. Average direction = (260 + 290) / 2 = 275º Average speed = (50 + 70) / 2 = 60 kt Therefore we should use an average wind velocity of 275º/60 kt for the climb",

The aircraft departs at 12:15 and we know that at 12:27 (after 12 minutes), the aircraft has covered 40 NM. Ground speed = (40 ÷ 12) x 60 = 200 kt At 12:33, the aircraft would have covered a further 20 NM: 12:33 – 12:27 = 6 min (200 kt x 6 min) / 60 = 20 NM At 40 NM + 20 NM = 60 NM along the route (12:33), the aircraft is 4 NM to the left of the intended track. Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 60 TKE = 4° If we alter our heading by 4° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 20 TKE = 12º So turning 4° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 4° + 12° = 16º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the left, therefore we must fly 16º to the right. Track = 235º + 16º = 251º The aircraft 80 NM – 60 NM = 20 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 20 NM in 6 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:33 + 6 min = 12:39",

Based in the calculation of the position of airplane based in the direction and the ground distance traveled from a determined point. With the introduction of modern navigational techniques such as GPS and conventional radio navigational aids, this may seem outdated technique. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.

If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM. If so, 2 NM off-track must equate to a 6° drift angle and 3 NM off-track must equate to a 9° drift angle. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which has a drift angle of 4° after 60 NM, will be 4 NM off-track. Thus, after 24 NM, the aircraft will have a cross-track error of: 4° x 24 / 60 NM = 1.6 NM",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.

Set True Heading (020ºM) under \"True Index\" 2. Place centre dot over TAS (260 kts) 3. Mark the point where drift (10ºL) and GS (228 kt) meet. 4. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. 5.

Variation is added to true to arrive at magnetic, or subtracted from magnetic to get true. 068ºM - 20ºW = 048ºT W/V = 048ºT / 54 kt",

(2) Place wind direction (130º) under the true index (3) Mark wind velocity downwards from the centre. It can be done from arbitrary positions, only magnitude is important. (i.e Vw = 30 kt, if centre is on 163, mark wind on 133). NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true heading (254º) under the true index (5) Read the Groundspeed of 182 kt and a drift of 8ºR. Using drift angle and heading, determine track: Drift angle is how many degrees the heading is to the right or left of the track. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. Drift Angle: 3ºL True Track = True Heading + drift angle True Track = 254º + 008º = 262ºT",

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (4/30) x 60 = 8º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (4 / (150 - 30)) x 60 = 2º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 8º + 2º = 10º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

The pilot expects the aircraft to be tracking the 320º radial, but finds out that the aircraft has actually tracked 323º from the VOR. This is 3º to the right, and that means that this could be due to a lesser crosswind component than forecast, given the wind from the right and from behind. It could also be due to a different headwind/tailwind component, but this can be discounted by calculating the distance versus the expected distance travelled. The pilot expects to fly at 158 kt groundspeed with the forecast wind, and has flown for 30 minutes outbound from KOK VOR. Therefore the pilot expects to be at 158/60 x 30 = 79 nm from the DME, and this is almost exactly correct. Therefore, the tailwind component has been the same. This means that the lesser crosswind is certainly what has caused the drift off track.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever. LO 061.01.03.01.05: Explain changes of variation with time and position.",

If the track error is larger, the error will be proportionally larger, so 60 NM along track a 2o track error will place you 2 NM off track, or 1 NM off track after 30 NM. The rule can be used to determine the track error angle,when the displacement is known, the displacement, when the track is known and correction to intercept, when displacement is known. The correction that must be made to intercept the DET VOR is given by the following formula, which is based on the 1:60 rule: (Distance off track / Miles to go) = (Degrees to intrercept / 60). Solving for Degrees to intercept we get: Degrees to intercept = (Distance off track x 60) / Miles to go = (2.5 NM x 60) / (27 NM - 15 NM) = 12.5o. Thus, since the aircraft is off-track to the left, the correction that must be made to arrive at DET VOR must be to the right, and its magnetic heading must be: Planned Magnetic Heading from M20 junction to DET VOR + Degrees to intercept = 283o (M) + 12.5o = 295.5o, which is very close to 296o.",

In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: In the attachment we can find the distance from A to B, which is 50 NM. Therefore, the distance to go is 15 NM (50 NM - 35 NM). TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 5° + 12° = 17º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The track is 090º and the track error was to the North, therefore, to reach B, the pilot needs to turn right: 095º + 17º = 112º",

Effects of Cold Temperature on Baro-vertical Navigation (VNAV) Vertical Guidance Non-standard temperatures can result in a change to effective vertical paths and actual descent rates when using aircraft baro-VNAV equipment for vertical guidance on final approach segments. A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate. Pilots should consider potential consequences of these effects on approach minima, power settings, sight picture, visual cues, etc., especially for high-altitude or terrain-challenged locations and during low-visibility conditions.",

However, based on the information provided in the question (RMI Deviation), we can infer that the RMI readings will be relative to Compass North. Given that the ADF is tuned to an NDB, the ADF needle on the RMI works as follows: The Tip of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing to the NDB (300°). The Tail of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing from the NDB (120°). In this case, we assume that the RMI is subjected to electromagnetic interference and therefore, deviation is applied: -2ºW (westerly deviation) ⇒ Compass North is 2° West of Magnetic North. Let’s start by converting compass heading to magnetic heading: Deviation west, compass best; Deviation east, compass least Magnetic Bearing to the NDB = Compass Bearing to the NDB - 002° = 300° - 002° = 298° Since the question asks for true bearing, we need to correct for magnetic variation: Variation west, magnetic best; Variation east, magnetic least. Remember that for NDB/ADF bearings the bearings are taken at the aircraft, therefore the magnetic variation applicable at the aircraft's position is to be used: Variation at the DR position = 22° West ⇒ Magnetic North is 22° West of True North True Bearing to the NDB = Magnetic Bearing to the NDB - 022° = 298° - 022° = 276°",

Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082°T. Variation is 001°W, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082°T+ 1° = 083° M(Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM. Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.",

First we need to find out the wind information, using the flight computer: 1. Course/track aligns with the TRUE HEADING on the wind side of the flight computer (090º). Central grommet on the ground speed (290º). 2. The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value than the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. 3. Maintaining the central grommet over the G/S line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS (250 kt) and make a pencil mark (10ºL). 4. Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centreline between the grommet and the true index. 5. Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark (60 kt). 6. Read the true wind direction under the true index (315º). Now that we've determined the wind speed and angle, we can apply the formula: Crosswind Component (XWIND) = Wind Speed × sin (Wind Angle) Given a heading of 080º and a wind angle of 315º, the difference is 235º. Crosswind Component (XWIND) = 60 × sin (235º) = −49.15 kt Since the heading is 080º and the tracking is 090º, it's evident that the wind is from the left and on the tail, therefore it is blowing the aircraft to the right: 49 kt right.

We can use the \"drift\" value in the wind calculation instead of the track, so there's no need to work out the track here. The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (high speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (North) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (500 kt) under the central point Place a dot where the relevant drift line (12ºL) meets the groundspeed (550 kt). (we have shown a line from the centre to this point for easier viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top. The wind speed is the amount of knots the line or dot is below the centre point (500 kt - 380 kt = 120 kt in this case). True wind velocity = 108º(T)/120 kt Closest Answer = 109º/120 kt",

The difference between the direction of magnetic north and that of compass north is called \"deviation\". Deviation is measured in degrees and is described as \"East\" (+) or \"West\" (-).

The highest speed of the Earth in its orbit is at perihelion, the lowest at aphelion. Perihelion occurs in early January and Aphelion in early July. These differences in range are not enough to cause the seasons, but these come from the Earth's tilt or, using astronomic terminology, the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic (where ecliptic, the name given to the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere).

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 Planned track distance flown = 140 x 30’ = 70 NM TE = (7/70) x 60 = 6º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 Distance at which we want to rejoin track = 140 x 45’ = 105 NM CA = (7/105) x 60 = 4º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 6º + 4º = 10º R The aircraft is left off-track, the aircraft must fly right to regain track.",

The range between the aircraft crossing R360 BUN and BUN VOR is equal to their the Change of Latitude.

For a spherical Earth, latitude and longitude are angles seen from the center of the Earth and only for the longitude is the exactly the same as for an ellipsoid Earth. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic longitude is defined as \"The angular distance between the prime meridian and another meridian passing through a point on the Earth's surface\" or \"The angle in the equatorial plane between the line a that connects the Earth's centre with the prime meridian and the line b that connects the centre with the meridian on which the point lies\".

(1) Place the track (324º) under the true index. (2) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the ground speed (450 kt). (3) Maintaining the central grommet over the GS line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS and make a pencil mark.

(4) Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centerline between the grommet and the true index. (5) Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark: 68 kt (518 kt - 450 kt). (6) Read the magnetic wind direction under the true index: 204º. Note: This exercise is asking us for the magnetic wind direction, but since the track given is already magnetic, we don’t have to apply the variation. E6-B Flight Computer: Divide the Ground Speed and True Airspeed by 2: Ground Speed: 450 kt / 2 = 225 kt True Airspeed: 420 kt / 2 = 210 kt (1) Move the slide until the ring aligns with the arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (225 kt). (2) Rotate the transparent (azimuth) disk to position the Magnetic Track (324º) below the TRUE INDEX. (3) The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is 8º Left. Find where the 8º Left WCA intersects the arc corresponding to the True Airspeed (210 kt) and make a pencil mark. (4) Rotate the transparent (azimuth) disk until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline, above the ring, between the ring and the TRUE INDEX. (5) Determine the Wind Velocity by counting the lines between the ring and the pencil mark.

Thereafter, we are expected to find the new groundspeed required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Lastly, we will convert it back to IAS and determine the reduction.

Second Step (2): Find IAS 210 kt (inner scale, outer ring) and read the corresponding value of TAS 264 kt (outer scale). (2) Knowing the wind component and TAS, we can determine the ground speed: Wind component: -35 kt TAS: 264 kt Groundspeed = 264 kt – 35 kt = 229 kt (3) Calculate the time it would take to cover 150 NM at 229 kt: Time = Distance ÷ Speed Time = 150 NM ÷ 229 kt Time = 39.3 min (4) However, the aircraft is required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Therefore, we need to find the revised time: Revised time = 39.3 min + 5 min = 44.3 min (5) Determine the new groundspeed to meet the delay restriction: Groundspeed = (150 NM / 44.3 min) x 60 min = 203 kt (6) Considering the wind component and the groundspeed, calculate the revised TAS: Revised TAS = 203 kt + 35 kt = 238 kt (7) Determine IAS from TAS: First Step (1): Use the “AIR SPEED” window. Align 14 000 ft with -5ºC. Second Step (2): Find TAS 238 kt (outer scale) and read the corresponding value of IAS 188 kt (inner scale, outer ring).

From 2000 ft to FL290 => we will climb 27000 ft 2/3 x (27 000) = 18 000 ft We now add this to our initial pressure altitude of 2000 ft to obtain the PA. 18 000 ft + 2 000 ft = 20 000 ft Temp. 29 000 ft = -40º C Temp. 20 000 ft = 20 - (2 x 18) = -16º C Closest option: FL 200 with temperature -20° C",

(2) Find out True Track and Drift using the flight computer: Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (180 kt). Place wind direction (310°) under the true index Mark wind velocity downwards from the centre. It can be done from arbitrary positions, only magnitude is important. When the question provides a track → mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the Heading is known → mark wind velocity downwards from centre. Place your true heading (220°) under the true index. Read the Groundspeed of 184 kt and a drift of 8°L. (3) Calculate True Track using Heading and Drift The drift is the angle difference from the Heading to the Track, so a 8° left drift means that the Track should have a direction 8° less than the Heading. This only applies if they are using the same datum, so both Magnetic, both True, etc. True Track = 220° - 8° = 212°",

However, the option \"By selecting a suitable echo from the display, obtaining the relative bearing and distance, and converting it into a true bearing to plot on the chart.\" has been confirmed by feedback to be correct in official exams. The pilot may take a relative bearing from an AWR display and would then use the aircraft heading to turn the relative heading into a magnetic or true bearing to. Thereafter, the reciprocal from the ground feature can be back-plotted as true or magnetic. On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

If we assume an equal change of wind direction and speed per 1 000 ft, we can say that he wind direction increases by 1.66° / 1 000 ft (30° within 18 000 ft) and 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft (30 kt within 18 000 ft). W/V used for climb problems is the WV at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. W/V used for descent problems is the WV at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The altitude change in the climb is 20 000 - 2 000 = 18 000 ft. 2 / 3 x 18 000 ft = 12 000 ft. 12 000 ft through the climb occurs at 2 000 + 12 000 = 14 000 ft. Therefore, 14 000 ft will be 14 000 - 2 000 ft = 12 000 ft higher than 2 000 ft. Wind direction at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66° / 1 000 ft = 20° higher than wind direction at 2 000 ft. Wind speed at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft = 20 kt higher than wind speed at 2 000 ft. Consequently, at 14 000 ft wind is 280° + 30° = 300° and wind speed is 20 + 20 = 40 kt. CAS = 220 kt “To find TAS, add 2% to the CAS for every 1 000 ft of altitude.” TAS = CAS + 2% CAS x (Altitude) / 1 000 ft = 220 + 2% 220 x 14 000 / 1 000 = 282 kt Determining G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (282 kt). (2) Place wind direction (300º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (40 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (225°) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (282 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 269 kt; → the closest option is 264 kt",

Therefore, we need to find the TAS for the aircraft at 14 000 ft, with OAT = ISA -15ºC and a CAS of 150 kt. Calculating TAS using a suitable flight computer (We have used a CRP-5). First, calculate the OAT: The ISA temperature at 14 000 ft = 15 - 2(14) = -13ºC. The OAT is ISA - 15ºC, so OAT = -13 - 15 = -28ºC On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 14 000 ft with the OAT of -28ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 150 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 181 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is under 300 kt, there is no need to make a compressibility correction. Therefore, the average TAS to be used for climb calculations is 181 kt",

This angle represents the deviation between the W/V vector and the Ground Speed/True Track vector. Assuming θ represents the angle between the Ground Speed/True Track vector and the True Airspeed/True Heading vector, we can deduce: sin(θ) = Wind Velocity/True Airspeed = 10/120 = 0.083 ⇒ sin-1(0.083) = 4.78° ≈ 5°. Considering that the True Airspeed/True Heading Vector lies to the LEFT of the Ground Speed/True Track vector, we conclude: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) = 5° left",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During descent with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 274 kt and a TAS of 416 kt, at a lower altitude during the descent, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and CAS higher than 274 kt and 416 kt correspondingly, is CAS: 324 kt and TAS: 430 kt.

Rotate the disk until wind direction 110o is under the True index. Mark wind velocity 35 kt below the centre dot. Rotate the disc until the true heading 130o is under the True index. The mark shows a drift 9o right and Groundspeed 75 kt. Drift is the angle difference from heading to track, so the True Track is: True Track = True heading + Drift = 130o + 9o = 139o. And the distance covered from 10:07 to 10:19 (in 12 minutes) with a Groundspeed of 75 kt is: Distance = 75 kt x 12/60 hr = 15 NM. Therefore, drawing on the chart with your plotter a true track of 139o and measuring a distance of 15 NM, the DR position at 10:19 will be: DR-3 (N48°37.3', E013°10.9').",

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. 1. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). 2. The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 2.5 nm is the off-track distance; know we need to determine the distance flown along the planned track. 15' x 130 = 32.5 nm 2.5 nm ahead of the dead reckoning position: 32.5 + 2.5 = 35 nm TE = (2.5/35) x 60 = 4,3º R Point along track at which we want to rejoin the track: 50 - 35 = 15 nm CA = (2.5/15) x 60 = 10º R With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 4,3º + 10º = 14,3º The aircraft is right of track, the aircraft must fly left: New heading = 95º - 14,3º = 80,7º",

The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively). Thus, at mid-latitudes, such as 33°N, the sunrise occurs earlier and earlier every day.",

Drift is the angle difference from heading to track The aircraft flies along the radial 310° inbound a VOR, then its magnetic track is: 310° - 180° = 130°M. And since it drifts by 10oR, then its magnetic heading is: 130°M - 10o = 120oM. For this question using your Navigation/Flight computer, apply the following steps: Place the centre dot over the TAS 480 kt. Set the Magnetic heading 120o under the True Index. Put a mark where the 10o starboard drift and the Groundspeed 415 kt coincide. Rotate the circular bezel until the mark you have made is exactly below the centre dot on the 0o drift line. The magnetic wind direction is shown under the True Index 075o (M). The wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot and the value under the mark: 480 kt - 380 kt = 100 kt. Therefore, the magnetic wind direction and speed is: 075°(M)/100 kt. E6-B Flight Computer Procedure: We are given a GS of 415 kt and TAS of 480 kt, however the wind speed on the slide reaches a maximum of about 264 kt, we can still use the E6-B flight computer following these steps: If your E6-B flight computer includes a high-speed side, you can skip the following steps and proceed directly to the procedure below using the given GS and TAS values. Divide the GS and TAS by 5: GS: 415 kt / 5 = 83 kt TAS: 480 kt / 5 = 96 kt Now, with GS = 83 kt and TAS = 96 kt, proceed as follows: Multiply the calculated (steps below) wind velocity by 5. Calculation of Magnetic Wind Direction and Velocity: Position the slide until the ring aligns with the speed arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (83 kt). Rotate the transparent disk to align the Magnetic Track (130°) under the TRUE INDEX. Determine the Wind Correction Angle (WCA): With a Drift angle of 10° to the right, WCA = 10° left. With the ring on the Ground Speed (83 kt) arc, mark the point where the 10° left WCA intersects the True Airspeed (96 kt) arc. Rotate the transparent disk until the mark aligns with the centerline, ABOVE the ring, between the ring and the TRUE INDEX. Count the lines between the ring and the mark to determine the Wind Velocity. In this case, with the ring on the 83 kt arc and the mark on the 103 kt arc, Wind Velocity = 100 kt (103 - 83 = 20, 20 x 5 = 100). Read the Magnetic Wind Direction under the TRUE INDEX. In this case, the value is 075°, resulting in Magnetic Wind Direction = 075°.",

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for. True Track is 300º with drift 8º R, means that TT is right of Heading 292º (T). True heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass heading (C) 292º 10ºW 302º 4ºW 306º",

And since it drifts by 10° right, its heading is: 083°T - 10° = 073°T. A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 150 kt and put true heading 143°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 10° right drift. Now put the next heading 073°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 10° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 028°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (150) and the value under the drift lines intersection (118): 150 kt - 118 kt = 32 kt. Thus, the wind velocity and direction (T°) is 028°/32 kt.",

Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: Set Wind Direction under True Index. Mark wind Velocity up from center point (100 kts). Set True Course under True Index. Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed. Ground Speed reads under center. WCA reads between center line and wind velocity mark. Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for. Wind Correction Angle is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track.

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (3/60) x 60 = 3º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (3/60) x 60 = 3º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 3º + 3º = 6º R The aircraft is left off-track, the aircraft must fly right to regain track.",

In these cases, the TAS and W/V to use on the Flight/Nav computer is as follows: For Climb problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The aircraft climbs from MSL (0 ft) to FL270. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: 0 ft + [2/3 x (27 000)] ft = 18000 ft For the wind velocity at 18 000 ft then, we would usually have to interpolate 3/5ths of the way from 15 000 ft to 20 000 ft, but the winds are the same so no interpolation necessary. We can use the wind velocity 310º(T)/45 kt. For OAT, the ISA temperature at 18 000 ft is 15 - 2(18) = -21ºC, and the OAT is ISA +5ºC, so OAT = -16ºC To find the groundspeed, we first needs to calculate the TAS. (We have used a CRP-5 and the wind-down method here) On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 18 000 ft with the OAT of -16ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 280 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 373 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is over 300 kt, this needs to be corrected. In the COMP. CORR. window, calculate and apply the small correction in the direction of the arrow (only 0.7 divisions). Go back to the CAS of 280 kt on the inner scale, and read off the new TAS of 369 kt on the outer scale. The Groundspeed can be found using the wind side of the computer. Set wind direction 310ºT under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the centre point on the TAS of 369 kt * Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially set the True Track 045°T under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would give 6º drift and a track of 051º, so reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 045º. This occurs at a heading of 038º with 7º Right drift. The groundspeed of this track is approximately 370 kt Therefore the average groundspeed for the climb is 370 kt, closest answer 371 kt. *Note: If your flight computer does not include high speeds, set 269 kt or 169 kt at the center point as TAS (TAS - 100 kt or TAS - 200 kt) and follow the rest of the procedure. At the final Ground Speed result you will need to add the 100 kt or 200 kt that you subtracted from TAS.",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 100 kt. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 180º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 17ºR drift and a track of 197º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 180º. This occurs at a heading of 163º with 17ºR (+) drift. WCA and drift are opposite to each other and of equal magnitude. A drift of 17ºR corresponds to a WCA of 17ºL (-). Triangle of Velocities: When creating the velocity triangle using the provided data, a right-angled triangle is established. This right angle corresponds to the angle formed by the W/V vector and the Ground Speed/True Track vector. If we denote θ as the angle between the Ground Speed/True Track vector and the True Airspeed/True Heading vector, the relationship can be expressed as follows: sin(θ) = Wind Velocity/True Airspeed = 30/100 = 0.3 ⇒ θ = 17.46º ≈ 17°. Since the True Airspeed/True Heading Vector is to the Left of the Ground Speed/True Track vector, we get that: Wind Correction Angle = 17° Left or -17°.",

If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (3/15) x 60 = 12º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (3 / (105 - 15)) x 60 = 2º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 12º + 2º = 14º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

            "explanation": "The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to its orbital elliptical path around the Sun at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth's equator is 23.5o. The Sun will be exactly overhead 23.5o N in June, when \"the northern hemisphere summer solstice\" takes place and we have the longest day. Also, it will be overhead 23.5o S in December, when \"the northern hemisphere winter solstice\" will take place and we will have the longest night. The latitudes 23.5o N and 23.5o S are called the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively and represent the highest latitudes where the Sun will be directly overhead. The tilt of the Earth's axis is responsible for the longer nights in winter and the longer days in summer. It also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. Between the solstices are the Equinoxes, when the Sun is passing over the Equator, where night and day are of equal length. The equinoxes are the times when the relative length of night and day and the elevation of the noon sun, known as the declination of the Sun, are changing at the greatest rate. If you consider the time of sunrise at different points on the Earth's surface, it quickly becomes clear that the Sun rises at different times at different longitudes, because of the rotation of the Earth and different latitudes, because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day (except at high latitudes) and both times vary with latitude and time of the year. The reason for the variation of the duration of the daytime and nighttime throughout the year, is the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic. At the Equator, the length of the day and night varies very little and then only due to the differences between the mean solar day (which is used for time keeping) and the apparent time kept by the Sun. Hence, at the Equator the sunrise will always be close to 0600 LMT and the sunset close to 1800 LMT. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the time of sunrise and the time of sunset is approximately the same at all latitudes (within a few minutes of 0600 LMT and 1800 LMT respectively).",

If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

True direction (T) Variation (V) Magnetic direction (M) 105º 15ºE 090º Wind Correction Angle of +13º implies a correction to the right, resulting in a Wind Correction Angle of 13º Right. This adjustment shifts the True Heading to the right of the True Track by 13º. Therefore, the True Heading can be determined by adding 13º to the True Track True Heading = True Track + 013º = 105º + 013º = 118º. Follow the steps detailed below in order to find unknown wind (CRP-5 method): Adjust the slide until the centre dot aligns with the arc corresponding to True Airspeed (465 kt). Rotate the window disc to position the True Heading (118º) beneath the TRUE HEADING index. Calculate the Drift Angle. With True Track at 105º, derive Drift Angle as 13º Left (Port) from the window disc. Identify the point on the slide where the Left Drift Angle of 13º intersects the arc for Ground Speed (480 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline BELOW the center dot. Determine Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the vector between the center dot and the pencil mark. In this case, with the center dot on the 465 arc and the pencil mark on the (approximately) 357 kt arc, the Wind Velocity is approximately 108 kt (465 - 357 = 108). Read the (True) Wind Direction below the TRUE HEADING index. With the value 209 below the TRUE HEADING index, ascertain that the (True) Wind Direction is 209º.",

In this case, we can read a GS of approximately 369 kt. 6) Now, we can determine the drift angle. The end of the like is approximately at 5º Right, meaning that our drift angle equals approximately 5ºR. Please note that drift angle is simply \"how many degrees\" the Track is to the left or right of the Heading. If the Track is to the Left of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Left. If the Track is to the Right of the Heading, the Drift Angle is Right. Considering the above statement, we can conclude that the track equals 186º (TH + Drift = 181º + 5º = 186º)",

Map reading actually consists of two related, but different skills: Map to ground navigation for flight monitoring, where the pilot must be able to visualise the terain and physical features from symbols on the map. Ground to map navigation, when the aircraft's position is uncertain, where the ground features must be turned into a mentally perceived picture of the map and related to the map symbols. The choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. The rule for choosing a ground feature is to find something as unique as possible, such as masts, railways, rivers, bridges, etc. Also, the map to ground technique is recommended to avoid confirmation bias, for instance spotting a tower on the ground and convincing yourself that it is the church tower you would dearly like it to be on the map. For this question, the pilot chose ground features (towers, villages) as turning points, which are identical with many others and can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring. Also, VFR navigation at lower levels, as in our case 1500 ft above ground, restricts the view ahead and around by the next fold of high ground and objects may only appear when you are close to them and when they are not obscured by high ground. Probably, the pilot changed course at a wrong village, because of his/her low cruise altitude and not recommended ground features choice.",

Remember that \"Drift is the angle difference from heading to track\". Put a mark where the 8°R drift and the Groundspeed 139 kt coincide. Rotate the circular bezel until the mark you have made is exactly below the centre dot on the 0° drift line. The wind direction is shown under the True Index 236° (T). The wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot and the value under the mark: 147 kt - 125 kt = 22 kt. Therefore, the true wind direction and speed is: 236°(T)/22 kt.

Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 355º. This occurs at a heading of 348º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 186 kt. At a ground speed of 186 kt, after 30 min of flight, the distance covered should be 93 NM. However, according to the question text, tha aircraft is 4.5 NM ahead = 97.5 NM. Therefore, the actual ground speed = 97.5 NM x 2 = 195 kt To determine the actual track over the ground, we will calculate the actual TKE and add it to the planned track. TEK = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TEK = ( 3,5 / (93 + 4,5) ) x 60 = 2ºR 2º right means that the actual track of the aircraft over the ground is 355º + 2º = 357º Knowing the GS 195 kt, TAS 190 kt, heading 348º and track 357º, it is possible to determine the actual wind using the flight computer by following the steps below: Determining winds with the flight computer: Set True Heading (348ºT) under \"True Index\" Place centre dot over TAS (190 kts) Mark the point where drift (9ºR) and GS (195 kt) meet. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (253º) Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (190 - 160 = 30 kt) Actual W/V = 253º / 30 kt",

The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: [2/3 x (8 000 - 4 000)] ft + 4 000 ft= 6 667 ft. 2. With the data given, we cannot find the W/V at 4 000 ft and interpolate with the W/V at 8 000 ft for the 2/3 of the cruising altitude, but we can find through the flight/nav computer, the GS at 8 000 ft and interpolate with the GS given at 4 000 ft for the 2/3: Set wind direction to 200º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 240 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index.
