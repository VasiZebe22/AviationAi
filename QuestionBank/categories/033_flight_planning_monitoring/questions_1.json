The wind correction angle is the angle by which the pilot adjusts the heading to compensate for the crosswind component of the wind. Under the forecasted wind, the wind is causing the aircraft to drift to the right, necessitating a wind correction angle to the left. In contrast, with the wind now arriving from the right of the aircraft, it will tend to push the aircraft to the left, thereby requiring a wind correction angle to the right.",

Set wind direction to 080º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 155 kt. Mark the wind velocity 35 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 113º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 122º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 113º. This occurs at a heading of 104º with 7ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 124 kt. Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (-)7ºL WCA",

Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (170 knots). Position the wind direction (110º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (142º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (170 knots). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 9º left correction (-9º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude.

It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated. The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (190º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (179 kt). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 10º right correction (+10º).

For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, 9 500 ft etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 9 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too.

Knowing our True Altitude, let's find Indicated Altitude: Indicated Altitude = True Altitude + Temperature Correction + Pressure correction Temperature Correction Rule of thumb: correction of 4% for each 10ºC deviation from ISA ISA deviation = -10ºC. Therefore we will apply a correction of 4%. 15 421 ft x 4% = 617 ft As ISA deviation is negative (-10ºC), Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude. Indicated Altitude = 15 421 ft + 617 ft = 16 038 ft Pressure correction If the current QNH is 989 hPa, the difference to standard pressure will be: 1013 hPa – 989 hPa = 24 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30ft/hPa: 24 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 720 ft Since our current QNH is lower than standard, Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude: 16 038 ft + 720 ft = 16 758 ft. This altitude is also called Pressure altitude (PA). Remember that you are flying Westbound on a VFR flight - Therefore, your flight level should be EVEN and you should use the intermediate 500 ft => The Lowest usable flight level will be FL185 Further info on Cruising Levels: VFR and IFR aircraft are allocated different levels to fly at: IFR flights use whole 1000's of feet (e.g. 1000, 3000 etc. when flying eastbound, and 2000, 4000 etc. when flying westbound) VFR flights use the intermediate 500 ft. levels (e.g. 3500, 5500 etc. when flying eastbound and 4500, 6500 when flying westbound)",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and flight level Upon inspection of LOGI, we can see that it is situated between 4 different areas with different Grid MORAs (Minimum Off-Route Altitude). We must take the highest Grid MORA, in order to ensure that we have a safe vertical separation. The aircraft must fly at 10 800 ft. This must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 800/1000) = -648 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 11 448 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1018 hPa - 1013 hPa = 5 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (5) x 30 ft/hPa = 150 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 448 - 150 = 11 298 ft Since we are a VFR flight, we are required to fly at altitudes that are whole thousands plus 500 feet. The only altitude above 11 298 ft which also obeys this rule is FL115. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The VFR rules of flight level and/or altitude selection is the same as IFR ones with adding 500 ft to all levels. The default worldwide semi-circular rule is the East/West orientation of the flight level parity: Your aircraft has track between 0° and 179°, your flight level or altitude must be odd; Your aircraft has track between 180° and 359°, your flight level or altitude must be even. The appropriate altitude or flight level must be determined using the magnetic track (not heading). In this case, True Track (TT) equals 356º, applying the magnetic Variation provided (10ºW), we can find the Magnetic Track (MT) Variation West, magnetic direction BEST; Variation East, Magnetic Direction LEAST. MT = 356º + 10º = 006º According to the rules shared above, an ODD flight level + 500 ft must be used: First available Flight level above 8 701 ft => FL95",

Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The aligned with the route LOLC to LOGI plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 137o. Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart.

            "explanation": "When planning a route, the pilot will use visual check points to monitor the flight progress along a flight leg. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps, do not necessarily show up well from the air. Thus, the pilot, among others, should consider: Proximity to planned track: Ground features on or close to the track are preferred. Size and uniqueness: Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent will be easier to identify. Time of the year: Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. Planned Altitude: At lower levels, a selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Some of the problems faced by a pilot during VFR navigation at lower levels are the following: The horizon may be obscured by high ground, so attitude flying is difficult. Frequent changes may be needed to maintain the correct airspeed, while climbing or descending over undulating ground. The view ahead and around is restricted by the next fold of high ground. The angle at which you are looking becomes flatter and if a feature does not have some vertical extent (such as towers and wind farms), you are unlikely to see it at low level. A selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time (such as a river). Thus, towers and wind farms are the most suitable ground features for low level VFR navigation. But, among them, the best ones are those which are along the route and as close to the departure airport as possible, because the pilot will be aware of any drift or time deviation at the initial stages of the cruise phase proceeding in minor recalculations. Therefore, the visual reference landmark which best covers the forementioned criteria is the unlighted tower North of the town of Emmendingen, with elevation of 1 384 ft. NOTE: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. The current correct answer is the one that we have received feedback that is correct in the Austro, but we also see that in different authorities \"The unlighted tower North of Emmendingen town\" is marked as correct.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The ICAO VFR semi-circular rule can be derived, which permits the selection of FLs, in accordance with aircraft’s magnetic track. Tracks are specified as being either ‘eastbound’ or ‘westbound’. Eastbound tracks are 000°M - 179°M inclusive, and westbound, 180°M - 359°M inclusive. For the eastbound magnetic tracks we select Odd Fls + 500 ft (35,55,75, etc.). For the westbound magnetic tracks we select Even FLs + 500 ft (25,45,65, etc.). The question does not specify if the track is magnetic or true, but whichever the variation could be, the track still remains eastbound. Therefore, according to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, the FL that must be selected for 085° track is FL55.",

            "explanation": "Firstly, find the exact position of the two aerodromes, using the coordinates given, draw a straight line as a route between them and examine each statement carefully. Altitude selection: Before the route is recorded on the flight plan, we need to consider the altitude to fly at. The Minimum Grid Area Altitudes along the route are 5 400 ft, 7 200 ft and 4 100 ft. For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 7 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too. In portions of the whole route, a lower altitude could be flown, 5 500 ft, but with less vertical obstacle clearance provided, probably poor comms signal and encountered turbulence. Ground feature selection: Line features, such as highways, which cross vertically the intended track are highly recommended as ground features for navigation in VFR flights. Both Highways, A3 and A92, as line features, are very helpful for groundspeed and timing checks, because they both cross vertically the track. But among them, the A3 highway is more preferred since it is almost halfway. Of course, the Power plant at Vilshofen (1 593 ft) could be selected as a VFR checkpoint, since it covers the criteria that should be considered for a VFR ground feature selection, but the question asks for the best. NavAid selection: Between the LNZ and FRE VOR/DME, the former is the best to tune to, even just after take-off (if both relief and VOR’s range permit), since it easily leads to the destination, almost directly, with an insignificant course deviation.",

The two aerodromes are close to the 2oE isogonal. Thus, following the rhyme \"Variation East, Magnetic least\", the magnetic track is: 251oT - 2oE = 249oM Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart.

WCA is equal in magnitude with the drift angle, but opposite in sign. For this question, to find the WCA we need the Flight/Nav computer to find the required track, following the steps below: Place the centre dot over the TAS 380kt. Rotate the disc until the wind direction 060o is under the True index. Mark the wind velocity 60 kt under the centre dot. Rotate the disc again until the true heading: 085o + 5oE = 090o is under the True index. The mark shows a drift of 5°R. Thus, the WCA that must be applied is 5°L.",

The only possible known point for defining a VFR waypoint via bearing and distance is the airport reference point (ARP). An airport reference point (ARP) is a known and well-defined location on an airport used as a reference for navigation purposes. Using the ARP as a waypoint in a GNSS flight plan provides a reliable and accurate navigation aid for VFR flights, especially when flying within controlled airspace. This is because the ARP is precisely located on aviation charts and is well-known to air traffic controllers, making it easier to communicate your position to ATC if necessary. Power lines, major cities and large towns, and coastlines may be visually identifiable landmarks that can assist with navigation, but they are not as precise and reliable as using an airport reference point. Additionally, power lines may not always be visible, and coastlines can be affected by changing weather conditions, tides, and other factors, making them less reliable as navigation aids. Major cities and large towns can be useful as general orientation points but may not provide the necessary precision needed for accurate navigation within a controlled airspace.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­300 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 18 000 ft - 300 ft = 17 700 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (18 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-21 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-11 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (17 700/1000) = + 708 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 17 700 ft + 708 ft = 18 408 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Under the forecasted wind, the wind is causing the aircraft to drift to the right, necessitating a wind correction angle to the left.

Set wind direction to 080º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 155 kt. Mark the wind velocity 35 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 113º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 122º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 113º. This occurs at a heading of 104º with 7ºR drift.

Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (170 knots). Position the wind direction (110º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (142º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (170 knots). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 9º left correction (-9º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 9ºL corresponds to a drift of 9ºR.",

It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated. The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft. The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river. The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.",

Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (179 knots). Position the wind direction (330º) under the true index. Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center. Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center. Align your true track (190º) under the true index. Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (179 kt). The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 10º right correction (+10º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 10ºR corresponds to a drift of 10ºL.",

Knowing our True Altitude, let's find Indicated Altitude: Indicated Altitude = True Altitude + Temperature Correction + Pressure correction Temperature Correction Rule of thumb: correction of 4% for each 10ºC deviation from ISA ISA deviation = -10ºC. Therefore we will apply a correction of 4%. 15 421 ft x 4% = 617 ft As ISA deviation is negative (-10ºC), Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude. Indicated Altitude = 15 421 ft + 617 ft = 16 038 ft Pressure correction If the current QNH is 989 hPa, the difference to standard pressure will be: 1013 hPa – 989 hPa = 24 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30ft/hPa: 24 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 720 ft Since our current QNH is lower than standard, Indicated altitude is greater than True altitude: 16 038 ft + 720 ft = 16 758 ft. This altitude is also called Pressure altitude (PA). Remember that you are flying Westbound on a VFR flight - Therefore, your flight level should be EVEN and you should use the intermediate 500 ft => The Lowest usable flight level will be FL185 Further info on Cruising Levels: VFR and IFR aircraft are allocated different levels to fly at: IFR flights use whole 1000's of feet (e.g. 1000, 3000 etc. when flying eastbound, and 2000, 4000 etc. when flying westbound) VFR flights use the intermediate 500 ft. levels (e.g. 3500, 5500 etc. when flying eastbound and 4500, 6500 when flying westbound)",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and flight level Upon inspection of LOGI, we can see that it is situated between 4 different areas with different Grid MORAs (Minimum Off-Route Altitude). We must take the highest Grid MORA, in order to ensure that we have a safe vertical separation. The aircraft must fly at 10 800 ft. This must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 800/1000) = -648 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 11 448 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1018 hPa - 1013 hPa = 5 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (5) x 30 ft/hPa = 150 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 448 - 150 = 11 298 ft Since we are a VFR flight, we are required to fly at altitudes that are whole thousands plus 500 feet. The only altitude above 11 298 ft which also obeys this rule is FL115. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Set wind direction to 300º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 110 kt. Mark the wind velocity 16 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 7ºL drift and a track of 263º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 277º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 96 kt. Ground distance covered in 18 min = 18 min x 96kt / 60 min = 28.8 NM With your plotter measure the distance between MÜHLDORF and ALTÖTTING = 6 NM Your Top Of Descent (ToD) is 28.8 NM + 6 NM = 34.8 NM from MÜHLDORF",

The VFR rules of flight level and/or altitude selection is the same as IFR ones with adding 500 ft to all levels. The default worldwide semi-circular rule is the East/West orientation of the flight level parity: Your aircraft has track between 0° and 179°, your flight level or altitude must be odd; Your aircraft has track between 180° and 359°, your flight level or altitude must be even. The appropriate altitude or flight level must be determined using the magnetic track (not heading). In this case, True Track (TT) equals 356º, applying the magnetic Variation provided (10ºW), we can find the Magnetic Track (MT) Variation West, magnetic direction BEST; Variation East, Magnetic Direction LEAST.

Center your plotter at the centre of the LOLC aerodrome symbol, since the question asks for the track from LOLC aerodrome. Align the upper section of your plotter with the line which connects the two aerodromes. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The aligned with the route LOLC to LOGI plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 137o. Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart. For better accuracy, measure the distance between the centre of the two aerodrome symbols. So, using the appropriate scale of your plotter (SECTIONAL 1:500 000), you will find that the distance between LOLC and LOGI is 33 NM.",

Friestadt VOR is an excellent aid for flying this route IFR, but visually, the ground equipment for a VOR is small and sometimes difficult to spot. The high ground (2 392 ft) is North-East of Linz and would likely blend in with other relatively high terrain nearby, so would not be a good visual reference point in any case.",

            "explanation": "When planning a route, the pilot will use visual check points to monitor the flight progress along a flight leg. Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps, do not necessarily show up well from the air. Thus, the pilot, among others, should consider: Proximity to planned track: Ground features on or close to the track are preferred. Size and uniqueness: Large objects with colour contrast and/or some vertical extent will be easier to identify. Time of the year: Changes in vegetation or snow cover can cause the same landscape to take on a different appearance at different times of the year. Planned Altitude: At lower levels, a selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time. Some of the problems faced by a pilot during VFR navigation at lower levels are the following: The horizon may be obscured by high ground, so attitude flying is difficult. Frequent changes may be needed to maintain the correct airspeed, while climbing or descending over undulating ground. The view ahead and around is restricted by the next fold of high ground. The angle at which you are looking becomes flatter and if a feature does not have some vertical extent (such as towers and wind farms), you are unlikely to see it at low level. A selected visual check point may be hidden by high ground or only visible after the aircraft has passed over it and for a limited period of time (such as a river). Thus, towers and wind farms are the most suitable ground features for low level VFR navigation. But, among them, the best ones are those which are along the route and as close to the departure airport as possible, because the pilot will be aware of any drift or time deviation at the initial stages of the cruise phase proceeding in minor recalculations. Therefore, the visual reference landmark which best covers the forementioned criteria is the unlighted tower North of the town of Emmendingen, with elevation of 1 384 ft. NOTE: We have had conflicting feedback about this question. The current correct answer is the one that we have received feedback that is correct in the Austro, but we also see that in different authorities \"The unlighted tower North of Emmendingen town\" is marked as correct.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

            "explanation": "Firstly, find the exact position of the two aerodromes, using the coordinates given, draw a straight line as a route between them and examine each statement carefully. Altitude selection: Before the route is recorded on the flight plan, we need to consider the altitude to fly at. The Minimum Grid Area Altitudes along the route are 5 400 ft, 7 200 ft and 4 100 ft. For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 7 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too. In portions of the whole route, a lower altitude could be flown, 5 500 ft, but with less vertical obstacle clearance provided, probably poor comms signal and encountered turbulence. Ground feature selection: Line features, such as highways, which cross vertically the intended track are highly recommended as ground features for navigation in VFR flights. Both Highways, A3 and A92, as line features, are very helpful for groundspeed and timing checks, because they both cross vertically the track. But among them, the A3 highway is more preferred since it is almost halfway. Of course, the Power plant at Vilshofen (1 593 ft) could be selected as a VFR checkpoint, since it covers the criteria that should be considered for a VFR ground feature selection, but the question asks for the best. NavAid selection: Between the LNZ and FRE VOR/DME, the former is the best to tune to, even just after take-off (if both relief and VOR’s range permit), since it easily leads to the destination, almost directly, with an insignificant course deviation.",

Calculate the Cruise Time from LIRJ to LIRS: Cruise distance / Groundspeed = 24 NM / 134 kt = 0.18 hr or 10.7 min. 3. The time required from the destination Marina Di Campo (LIRJ) aerodrome to the alternate aerodrome Grosseto (LIRS) is the sum of the following: Time to climb from LIRJ to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing: 3 min. Time to cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing: 10.7 min. Time to descent from top of descent to LIRS: 4 min. Thus, the time required is: 3 min + 10.7 min + 4 min = 17.7 min, closest answer 18 min.

For this question, to find the WCA we need the Flight/Nav computer to find the required track, following the steps below: Place the centre dot over the TAS 380kt. Rotate the disc until the wind direction 060o is under the True index. Mark the wind velocity 60 kt under the centre dot. Rotate the disc again until the true heading: 085o + 5oE = 090o is under the True index. The mark shows a drift of 5°R. Thus, the WCA that must be applied is 5°L.",

The only possible known point for defining a VFR waypoint via bearing and distance is the airport reference point (ARP). An airport reference point (ARP) is a known and well-defined location on an airport used as a reference for navigation purposes. Using the ARP as a waypoint in a GNSS flight plan provides a reliable and accurate navigation aid for VFR flights, especially when flying within controlled airspace. This is because the ARP is precisely located on aviation charts and is well-known to air traffic controllers, making it easier to communicate your position to ATC if necessary. Power lines, major cities and large towns, and coastlines may be visually identifiable landmarks that can assist with navigation, but they are not as precise and reliable as using an airport reference point. Additionally, power lines may not always be visible, and coastlines can be affected by changing weather conditions, tides, and other factors, making them less reliable as navigation aids. Major cities and large towns can be useful as general orientation points but may not provide the necessary precision needed for accurate navigation within a controlled airspace.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­300 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 18 000 ft - 300 ft = 17 700 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (18 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-21 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-11 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (17 700/1000) = + 708 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 17 700 ft + 708 ft = 18 408 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.

The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes.

Some services will also provide advisory avoiding action. Thus, the PIC when \"under vectors\", should follow the ATC's instructions. In a radar environment, heading information given by the pilot and heading instructions given by the controllers are in degrees magnetic. Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA), also known as Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), is the lowest alltitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during vectoring. MRVA allows the ATC to vector and descent an aircraft below MSA to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Therefore, the pilot should turn left to head 285°(M) and descend to 2300 feet.

In this case, the runway has a HIALS (High-Intensity Approach Lighting System) type II, which looks like the picture shows. This is a large and very bright approach lighting system, often used for CAT II and III landings also, as the lights penetrate through low visibility well.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 27 700 ft (25 700 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (27 700/1 000) = 1 108 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­26 592 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1033 hPa - 1013 hPa = 20 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 26 592 ft - 600 ft = 25 992 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: This question is trying to trick you. Do not forget that RVSM airspace is between FL290 to FL410. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The Minimum En-route Altitude (MEA) between PEXAN and MIL is 3 500 ft which means that the aircraft can descend from 7 000 ft but it must fly above 3 500 ft. “MSA in the area will be 3 600 ft” Incorrect. The Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) is the lowest altitude which may be used which will provide a minimum clearance of 300 m (1 000 ft) within a 25 NM radius from the navigational facility. In this case, MSA can be read left of Santorini airport. MSA is 3 500 ft and not 3 600 ft.",

This chart observes two different flight paths; CDFA (solid line) and non-CDFA (dashed). In addition, the missed approach point is indicated on the chart for both approach types. When in doubt when approaching using the overlay method, rely on conventional methods. The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GNSS equipment to fly existing, conventional STAR procedures, without replacing it. It follows the same route as the conventional procedure, with waypoints defined by coordinates instead of bearings and distances from ground navigation aids. In most cases, each ground navigation aid or intersection point of the conventional STAR, corresponds to an RNAV waypoint. Additionally, some RNAV waypoints (Fly-by or Fly-over) may be added, non-existing in the conventional STAR, to facilitate the turns. An RNAV STAR overlay may be either shorter or longer in distance than an RNAV STAR, depending on the design.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 3 300 ft (MOCA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (27/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of approx. 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-7ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -22ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 300 ft - 27 ft = 3 273 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (3 273/1 000) = 288 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 3 588 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 210 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3 588 ft - 210 ft = 3 378 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south magnetic track of 182º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL40. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (10) × (7 800/1 000) = 312 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 7 488 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 488 ft - 360 ft = 7 128 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 135º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC.

            ],
            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft is flying at 3 300 ft. This altitude is the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (179/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature at the aerodrome elevation of approx. 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+8ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -7ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -7ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 300 ft - 179 ft = 3 121 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-7) × (3 121/1 000) = 87 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of 3 387 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 3 387 ft + 660 ft = 4 047 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south magnetic track of 182º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL60.",

In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings. The conventional Standard Instrument Departure procedures (SIDs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV SIDs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates. The FMS takes navigational inputs from GPS, IRS and ground navigational aids. If GPS signal is lost, then IRS and ground navigational aids still work, as a back-up option. Thus, the aircraft's GPS receiver must be always available for the RNAV SID procedure and the others are required in case of problem with the GNSS. Obviously, the aircraft's VOR and DME receivers must be serviceable, since the DKB4H RNAV SID procedure uses the ground navigational aids STG and DKB VOR/DMEs for guidance, which must be serviceable too.",

Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­210 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 35 000 + 210 = 35 210 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × 20× (34090/1000) = 2 727 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­­32 483ft. This gives a difference in values of 35000 - 32483 = 2517 RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 15 500 ft - 8 000 ft = 7 500 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (7 500/1 000) = -450 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 15 950 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa.

It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a Radial 090o from the Aberdeen (ADN) VOR/DME. The radial crosses two radar minimum altitude areas, whose minimum altitudes are 1700 ft and 2000 ft. Therefore, flying inbound ABERDEEN VOR/DME (ADN) on Radial 090o, an aircraft initially passes MRVA 2000 ft and as approaching to the Aberdeen VOR/DME it passes MRVA 1700 ft.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 975 hPa = 38 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 38 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 140 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 7 000 ft - 1 140 ft = 5 860 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-20ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (5 860/1000) = -352 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 5 860 ft - 352 ft = ­­­­­5 508 ft. Closest answer: 5 510 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (8 230/1 000) = -593 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 8 823 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 540 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 823 ft + 540 ft = 9 363 ft.

This route should be the most appropriate one, in case the LE(R)-63 was activated by a NOTAM, which would restrict any aircraft to pass through, since it is the only one that sidesteps the restricted area. The ATS route VLC - A34 - ALT - W810 - VSJ - W820 - AMR can be followed and it is: 195 NM. Aside airways G850, W810 and W820, \"2\" indicates the Conditional Route Category, according to which these airways are plannable and can be used only during times designated in the Conditional Route Availability Message (CRAM), published at 1500 for the 24 hour period starting at 0600 the next day. In this case, the question specifically states that the pilot will fly a conditional route, the shortest route flying a conditional route is: VLC - G850 - AMR.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us via the comments, the question feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. There are a few ways of ensuring a safe altitude to fly at whilst IFR. Around an aerodrome, you can use the MSA which goes out to 25nm from the aerodrome or a nearby nav-aid. These are documented on aerodrome charts. On a pre-determined route, you can use the MEA (minimum en-route altitude) or the MOCA (minimum obstacle/obstruction clearance altitude), which are slightly different, but both provide sufficient terrain clearance (usually 5 nm either side of the route) When close to a route, you can use that route's MORA (minimum off route altitude) which Jeppesen provide out to 10 nm from the route (useful for avoidance, offsets, etc.). Off a planned route completely, you can use the grid MORA from the en-route charts, which gives sufficient obstacle clearance with everything in that grid box (which is one segment of the latitude/longitude grid of the chart. All these give roughly the same obstacle clearance. Minimum 1000 ft everywhere, and minimum 2000 ft in \"mountainous areas\" where the terrain is higher than 5000 ft. There are small changes with some of them and in different countries, but this rule usually works for all the exam questions we currently know about.",

Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS), where ground stations directly relay integrity data to the aircraft. Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), where the integrity data is relayed through a satellite link. Because satellites are monitored from the ground, it may take some considerable time before users become aware of a malfunction in the system. At present, two methods exist within airborne equipment to provide integrity of navigation under these circumstances: Using a system called Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). To combine satellite positioning with more conventional navigation systems to create a multi-sensor navigation system using inputs such as barometric altitude and time. It is important before flight to check that there will be enough satellites visible for an accurate position at all stages of the flight. This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the notice advisory to NANU messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation. GNSS can be augmented by GBAS and SBAS and NOTAMs must be checked to ensure they are available for the time of usage. Augmentation such as GBAS, SBAS and RAIM check for errors and correct them and/or notify the flight deck. Non-augmented GNSS simply use the satellites in sight and positioning. Timing errors or the loss of a satellite signal are not notified to the flight deck nor is the error in the position a solution. Therefore, the availability of the relevant satellites and any potential outages must be checked before flight.",

LNAV/VNAV uses GNSS plus a barometric VNAV* system to give vertical guidance on the approach, and is a 3-dimensional (3D) approach with lower minimums than LNAV only. LPV minimums are even lower, as low as 200ft due to the narrowing effect of the allowed track (like a localiser), and the incredibly accurate position data - and integrity - is gained by using SBAS augmentation to the GNSS signal, it is also a 3D approach standard. The 3D approaches here are not precision approaches, they sit somewhere in between non-precision and precision, and are called APV approaches, Approaches with Vertical Guidance. *Baro-VNAV is the minimum that can be used, but there is \"backwards compatibility\" in RNP APCH, so the more accurate SBAS can be used to perform an approach down to LNAV/VNAV minima, if the state publishing the procedure allows it.

In any case, it is essential that pilots comply with the procedures and information depicted on instrument flight charts and the appropriate flight parameters (.) if the aircraft is to remain in the areas developed for obstacle clearance purposes. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given bank angle is directly proportional to the square of the airspeed. Which means that doubling the airspeed results in a radius of turn that is four times greater RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

            "explanation": "The chart depicts the Radar Minimum Altitudes or Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitudes (MRVA) or Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) or ATC Surveillance Minimum Altitude (ASMA). It is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during radar vectoring and meets obstacle clearance requirements in the airspace specified. MRVA allows ATC Radar to vector and descend an aircraft below the Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) to achieve VFR or to join a procedure. Thus, MRVA can have a lower value than MSA. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times, until the aircraft reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. Especially, an MRVA provides obstacle clearance 1000 ft above the highest obstruction in non-mountainous areas and 2000 ft above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. On this chart, you can see different sectors (areas of application of a minimum vectoring altitude) and their corresponding minimum radar altitudes. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction used to determine the MRVA in that sector. For this question, draw with your pencil a SW Radial 225o from the Aberdeen airport. The radial crosses four radar minimum altitude areas, whose minimum altitudes are 4100 ft, 3200 ft, 2800 ft and 2300 ft respectively. Therefore, flying inbound ABERDEEN airport on Radial 225o, an aircraft initially passes MRVA 4100 ft and 3200 ft as approaching to the Aberdeen VOR/DME it passes MRVA 2800 ft and MRVA 2300 ft.

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above: Pressure Altitude = 27 360 ft + 300 ft = 27 660 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: RVSM airspace - FL290 to FL410.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­390 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 17 000 ft - 390 ft = 16 610 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL170). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (17 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-19 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-29 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 610 ft - 13 500 ft = 3 110 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (3 110/1000) = 124 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 16 610 ft - 124 ft = ­­­­­16 486 ft. The charted minimum grid altitude 16 200 ft in a mountainous terrain means that, an aircraft flying within this grid clears the highest obstacle by 2 000 ft. Thus, the highest obstacle is at: 16 200 ft - 2 000 ft = 14 200 ft. Therefore, the aircraft clears the obstacle by: 16 486 ft - 14 200 ft = 2 286 ft. RULES.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 690 ft = 4 310 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 4 310 ft - 1 000 ft = 3 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (3 310/1000) = 132 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 4 310 ft + 132 ft = 4 442 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The RF leg is defined by radius, arc length, and fix. RNP systems supporting this leg type provide the same ability to conform to the track-keeping accuracy during the turn as in the straight line segments. Note.— Bank angle limits for different aircraft types and winds aloft are taken into account in procedure design. 5.2.2 The other form of the FRP is intended to be used with en-route procedures. Due to the technicalities of how the procedure data are defined, it falls upon the RNP system to create the fixed radius turn (also called a fixed radius transition or FRT) between two route segments ( 5.2.3 These turns have two possible radii, 22.5 NM for high altitude routes (above FL 195) and 15 NM for low altitude routes.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 7 600 ft (Grid MORA already provides 2 000 feet clearance in Mountainous regions). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 7 600 ft - 178 ft = 7 422 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (7 422/1 000) = -505 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 7 600 ft + 505 ft = 8 105 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 986 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 810 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 105 ft + 810 ft = 8 915 ft. The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 200 kt. Mark the wind velocity 50 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 191º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 186º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 191º. This occurs at a heading of 196º with 6ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 244 kt.

A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation. This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn. A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot. The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differentiated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints.

The highest obstacle along VLC2N is 5 110 ft high, outside the MSA and it is above 5 000 ft, so we need 2 000 ft clearance. Therefore the minimum altitude the aircraft may descend to is 7 110 ft.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 210 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 8 000 ft + 210 ft = 8 210 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 210 ft - 300 ft = 7 910 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (7 910/1000) = -475 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 210 ft - 475 ft = ­­­­­7 735 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­360 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 3 500 ft + 360 ft = 3 860 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 860 ft - 1 416 ft = 2 444 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (2 444/1000) = 117 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 860 ft - 117 ft = 3 743 ft. Thus, the true height of the aircraft above the airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 3 743 ft - 1 416 ft = 2 327 ft, which is very close to 2 330 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1040 hPa - 1013 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­810 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 8 000 ft + 810 ft = 8 810 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 810 ft - 2 500 ft = 6 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (6 310/1000) = - 505 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 810 ft - 505 ft = 8 305 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 8168 4.3 TEMPERATURE CORRECTION 4.3.1 Requirement for temperature correction The calculated minimum safe altitudes/heights must be adjusted when the ambient temperature on the surface is much lower than that predicted by the standard atmosphere. In such conditions, an approximate correction is 4 per cent height increase for every 10°C below standard temperature as measured at the altimeter setting source. This is safe for all altimeter setting source altitudes for temperatures above –15°C. Even if the baromeric settings on the altimeter are correct, the true altitude will differ from the indicated altitude, if the temperature differs from the ISA values. The altimeter is calibrated to ISA. If the temperature differs from ISA, the QNH will only read the correct altitude on the ground. If you are airborne, you may need to apply a temperature correction to get the true altitude. In warm conditions (higher than ISA), this is not dangerous, because the trues altitude will be higher than the indicated (safe error). However, in very cold air (lower than ISA), and close to the ground, the temperature error may be critical as the true altitude will be less than the indicated altitude (dangerous error). An easy way to remember this is that, when the temperature is LOW, the aircraft will be LOWER than indicated. There are also two mnemonics that may be used to remember these effects: High - Low - High, which means that, if you fly from high to low, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read high. Low - High - Low, which means that, if you fly from low to high, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read low. And there is also an other one mnemonic to decide which effect requires attention: High to Low - Careful Go: which implies that, if you are going from either high temperature or pressure to lower, then you are closer to the ground than you expect. It is essential, therefore, to make an altimeter temperature error correction when calculating minimum descent heights in very cold conditions. The amount to add on to the indicated height or altitude to get the true value, is usually derived from correction tables. Therefore, in very cold conditions (colder than ISA), a temperature correction must added to the decision height (DH), MDH or MDA.",

            "explanation": "This question gives us a planned Flight Level of 290 (pressure altitude 29,000ft) and some meteorological conditions, which we must use to calculate our true altitude, and then compare to the local highest terrain to find our terrain clearance at this altitude. To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn pressure altitude into indicated altitude. The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 = 31 hPa less than standard pressure. Because we are in low pressure, our indicated altitude is lower than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 = 930 ft lower than the pressure altitude. Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 = 28,070 ft To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate. ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C. As our temperature is lower than ISA, our true altitude will be even lower than our indicated altitude. Temperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet). In this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)1909 ft Therefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 = 26,161 ft This makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 = 701 ft, closest answer 680 ft Note: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 590 ft and 690 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 27 360 ft + 300 ft = 27 660 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL290. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 500 ft (MSA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (8 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-20ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -18ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. For the temperature correction, the elevation of the airfield must be taken into account: 8 500 ft - 4 000 ft = 4 500 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (4 500/1000) = -324 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 824 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 824 ft + 300 ft = 9 124 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1010 hPa = 3 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 3 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­90 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 20 000 ft - 90 ft = 19 910 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 19 910 ft - 1 000 ft = 18 910 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (18 910/1000) = 756 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 19 910 ft + 756 ft = ­­­­­20 666 ft. Rounded to 100 ft = 20 700 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings. The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. Aircraft equipped with RNAV systems, which have been approved by the State of the Operator for the appropriate level of RNAV operations, may use these systems to carry out VOR/DME RNAV approaches and departures. An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GPS equipment to fly existing, conventional instrument STAR procedures. However, many of these overlays may not accurately reflect the correct STAR procedure and may even represent a different speed category of aircraft. The normal equipment for that RNAV STAR must always be used as the primary reference – and not the GPS - as it allows for efficient sequencing of the traffic flow, thus reducing the workload of the ATC. Otherwise, any disparity between the displays and the potential for mistakes are just as likely to diminish the safety margins.",

A fly-over waypoint is as it says, the aircraft has to actually pass overhead the waypoint before taking up the course for the next leg. A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation. This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn. A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot. The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differenciated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints. According to the route description at the bottom section of the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) 10-3Q chart, all aircraft, apart from B737, must fly overhead EHØ48. Therefore, for all aircraft other than B737, the EHØ48 RNAV waypoint is fly-by. But for B737 aircraft EHØ8Ø RNAV waypoint is a fly-over one.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 7 880 ft (5 880 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -18ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 7 880 ft - 2 075 ft = 5 805 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-18) × (5 805/1 000) = -418 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 8 298 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 298 ft + 300 ft = 8 598 ft. The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Entering an incorrect cruise level into the FMC can have significant consequences. The FMC uses the entered cruise level to calculate various parameters, including speeds, times, and fuel flows.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question is incorrect in the official exam and should be challenged or appealed!! The correct option should be FL130 instead of FL110. It seems that EASA is applying the temperature correction as if the meteorological station is located at the top of the obstacle. In reality, the temperature correction should only be applied to the required obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft if the meteo station is explicitly stated to be at the top of the mountain, which is not the case. Our explanation provides the correct method for solving this question. Unfortunately, you may need to remember the correct option and challenge it if you encounter this question in your official exam. As far as we currently know, the following authorities are considering the following options to be correct or not. Authority Reported Answer Portugal, ANAC FL130 UK CAA FL130 Czech Republic not FL130 Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 10 400 ft (8 400 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (10 400/1000) = -624 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­11 025 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1005 hPa = 8 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 8 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 240 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 11 025 ft + 240 ft = 11 265 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 140º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL130. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

            "explanation": "RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft. There is no need to calculate the pressure correction. The standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa does not require any pressure correction. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level in RVSM airspace, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300. Note: RVSM airspace - FL290 to FL410.",

The conventional Standard Instrument Departure procedures (SIDs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV SIDs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS. RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates. The FMS takes navigational inputs from GPS, IRS and ground navigational aids. If GPS signal is lost or GPS is inoperative, then IRS and ground navigational aids still work, as a back-up option and in this case the aircraft may follow the conventional SID.",

This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 6 000 ft - 540 ft = 5 460 ft. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 5 460 ft - 2 430 ft = 3 030 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (3 030/1000) = 182 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 5 460 ft - 182 ft = 5 278 ft.

(3) MORA values clear all terrain and man-made obstacles by 1 000 ft in areas where the highest terrain elevation or obstacles are up to 5 000 ft. A clearance of 2 000 ft is provided above all terrain or obstacles that are 5 001 ft and above.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (28 500/1 000) = -1 140ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­29 640 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 29 640 ft + 300 ft = 29 940 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL310. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "The chart depicts two conventional Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs): DKB 9B DKB 4H The conventional SIDs use ground navigational aids, thus the necessary equipment on board is required (such as VOR, DME, NDB receivers). The two SIDs require only VOR and DME receivers on board, since they are based on VOR/DME ground nav aids. An RNAV SID uses Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints followed by the FMS, which is based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these. GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates. According to the planview and the textual description of the two SIDs, the ground nav aid STG VOR/DME is required for both SIDs. The aircraft following both SIDs, must intercept immediately after take-off a radial emanating from the STG VOR to a distance with reference to the STG DME. Therefore, the only equipment which is NOT required for the two conventional SIDs is the aircraft GPS receiver.",
