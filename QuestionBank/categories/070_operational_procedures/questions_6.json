WINDSHEAR ESCAPE There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

NADP 1 prioritises noise abatement for areas close to the airport, by keeping the take-off flap/slat setting the same until 3000ft, but doing a thrust reduction at or above 800ft (can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). The aircraft only accelerates to remove flaps when 3000ft has been reached, as the act of accelerating the aircraft reduces the climb gradient, which makes the aircraft closer to the ground in a potentially noise sensitive zone. NADP 2 prioritses noise abatement for areas further from the airport, by doing a flap reduction and acceleration at 800ft (or slightly above) then reducing power immediately after that has occurred. This procedure does remove flaps and slats early, and allows acceleration to a better climb speed, which allows the aircraft to gain a better average rate of climb for noise abatement further from the aerodrome. Note: Thrust reduction occurs at or above 800ft, as stated above, it can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). However, acceleration occurs only when 3 000 ft has been reached (not before). The option \"Reduce thrust at 800 ft and accelerate.\" suggests that at 800 ft, the aircraft will accelerate, which is incorrect.",

Learning objective 071.02.02.01.05: Interpret the guidelines for fluid holdover times and list the factors which can reduce the fluid protection time. Source: ICAO Doc 9640 ‘Manual of Aircraft Ground De-icing/Anti-icing Operations’, Chapter 5: 5.1, 5.2 and Attachment ( 5 tables) ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.2 - HOT is the estimated time the anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of ice and frost and the accumulation of snow on the protected (treated) surfaces of an aeroplane. These HOTs are generated by testing fluids under a variety of temperature and precipitation conditions that simulate the range of weather experienced in winter. 4.3 - Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. Some further explanation can be gained from studying the example guideline table for holdover times, which includes differences due to OAT, fluid/water ratio, cold-soaked wings (skin temperature lower than ambient), etc.",

Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending. 5. You encounter more turbulence as you enter the final vortex.

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

A reduction in thrust to increase the rate of descent and/or a change in pitch attitude may counter this. - A downdraught that increases the rate of descent and decreases the IAS, thereby causing the aircraft to drop further below the glidepath. The situation worsens if the nose is still high and the thrust setting low. To counter this, power is re-applied, but with transport-category aircraft, the thrust does not increase instantaneously because the engines take time to speed up and the IAS continues to fall. - On leaving the downdraught, increasing tail winds cause a further reduction in IAS (Temporary Energy Loss). The rate of descent may lessen due to increased thrust availability. To counter this: - Apply full power whilst increasing pitch attitude rapidly and smoothly, but not aggressively, and consider pulling full backstick, if necessary, to minimize height loss - Do not change the configuration (except speed brakes), until the aircraft is out of the windshear, because operating the landing gear doors causes additional drag A successful recovery from a microburst encounter depends on the altitude, thrust, and speed reserves available. In addition to these effects, severe wind, turbulence, heavy rain, and blinding flashes of lightning often accompany microbursts.",

Garbage dumps: Many bird species, such as gulls, crows, and pigeons, are often found at garbage dumps because these areas provide a plentiful and easily accessible food source. The discarded food and waste attract birds looking for a quick meal. 3. Ponds or lakes: These bodies of water are natural habitats for many bird species, including ducks, geese, herons, and swans. Ponds and lakes offer abundant food sources such as fish, insects, and aquatic plants, as well as nesting sites and safe places for resting and breeding.",

The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. In calm air, the vortices remain parallel behind the aircraft and descend slowly. For aircraft flying along the same route or approach path, calm wind increases the chances of flying into the vortices of preceding traffic. Wake encounter could cause catastrophic inflight structural damage to an aircraft. The usual hazard is associated with induced rolling moments that can exceed the roll-control authority of the encountering aircraft. During inflight testing, aircraft intentionally flew directly up trailing vortex cores of larger aircraft. These tests demonstrated that the ability of aircraft to counteract the roll imposed by wake vortex depends primarily on the wingspan and counter-control responsiveness of the encountering aircraft. These tests also demonstrated the difficulty of an aircraft to remain within a wake vortex. The natural tendency is for the circulation to eject aircraft from the vortex.",

WINDSHEAR ESCAPE There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

Engine damage may range from dented compressor blades to vibration and engine failure. Windscreens may be shattered, impeding clear vision of the pilot, or in the worst-case causing decompression. Other parts of the airframe also commonly suffer from damage after a bird-strike, although it normally does not result in any critical failure in flight.

Please read the real question carefully and consider all the options. Do let us know if you come across this one in the exam so we can verify it, thank you! Cold-Soaked Fuel Frost (CSFF) The wings of aircraft are said to be “cold-soaked” when they contain very cold fuel as a result of having just landed after a flight at high altitude or from having been re-fuelled with very cold fuel. Whenever precipitation falls on a cold-soaked aircraft when on the ground, clear icing may occur. Even in ambient air temperatures up to +15°C, ice or frost can form in the presence of visible moisture or high humidity if the aircraft structure remains at 0°C or below. The following factors contribute to cold-soaking: temperature and quantity of fuel in fuel tanks, type and location of fuel tanks, length of time at high altitude, temperature of re-fuelled fuel and time since re-fuelling. In this question, it may be useful to go through each option: \"Your pitot tubes will become blocked.\" Pitot tubes can be heated so ice does not block them. \"Icing will appear on the wings when the OAT is below 0ºC.\" Whilst this can happen, cold-soaked fuel frost is very common at outside air temperatures above 0ºC, so this is not fully correct. \"Icing may appear on the wings if the wing temperature is below 0ºC.\" This is absolutely true. If the wing temperature is lower than 0ºC, cold-soaked fuel frost may occur from the high humidity in the air accreting directly to the cold wing surface through the process of deposition (sublimation if you are American). \"Icing will appear on the wings when the fuel temperature is above 0ºC.\" Whilst the skin temperature of the wing can be different from the fuel temperature, they are often very close together, and the wing skin temperature needs to be below 0ºC for CSFF to occur.",

The question does not state which approach is planned and whether the RNP AP will require RNP below 0.3 or not, therefore the safest option would be: \"RNP AR operations are NOT permitted.\" However, we have recently received feedback which confirms that that option was not marked as correct. Therefore, we have updated the correct option to \"RNP AR approach is still allowed.\".

The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

This version states that \"all radios were destroyed.\" With this in mind, let's examine the answer options: Try to contact ATC via CPDLC. There is more information on CPDLC below, but this is certainly one of it's functions. Assuning that the CPDLC is not included in \"all radios\" being destroyed then this is the correct answer. Try to contact ATC via ADS-B. ADS is for reporting aircraft position etc, not for communications. It does have an emergency function however, so is a possible answer, but is not as strong an option here as using CPDLC. You should not contact ATC. Obviously you should try to, being able to in this situation is something else. Try to squawk \"7600\" on your mode A transponder. 2 things here: 7600 is for radio problems, which you certainly have but squawking \"7500\" for unlawful interference or indeed \"7700\" for emergency would be better options. Secondly, were the transponders destroyed as part of \"all radios\"? If not, it's still a wrong answer due to the choice of squawk code. CPDLC is covered fully in the Instruments syllabus but here is more information… Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) using the FANS 1/A network has become the primary means of communicating with ATC in oceanic regions around the world and is also implemented in several domestic regions as well. One function of FANS CPDLC no crew ever wants to have to use is emergency reporting. During an emergency, the flight crew would normally revert to voice communications. However, the crew may use CPDLC for emergency communications if it is either more expedient or if voice contact cannot be established.",

Quickly identifying the source and taking prompt action significantly reduces the risk of an onboard fire. The main priorities are: Identify the source of the smoke. Rapidly assess the situation. Take immediate action to access fires that may be behind interior panels. Land as soon as possible at the nearest suitable aerodrome. One of the first signs of a hidden fire could be smoke coming from areas that are not easily accessible, such as sidewalls, overhead panels, air ducts, ceiling panels, or cargo compartments. These areas often have limited or no access, making monitoring difficult or even impossible. Smoke from these hidden areas is a serious warning sign. Given that the question already indicates there is no visible source, it is crucial for the crew to immediately inform the Captain. For example, smoke escaping from the seams of a wall panel could indicate electrical arcing that has ignited nearby material. In such cases, the pilots must quickly isolate any related electrical systems and plan to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome.

EASA is referring to a micro-burst when they say \"downdraft\". A micro-burst is a localized column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm. For these questions involving wind shear and micro-bursts, the scenario can be considered in 3 parts: Position 1 on the figure: An increasing head wind which increases the energy of the aircraft. The airspeed increases and the aircraft floats up above the flight profile. Position 2 on the figure: The aircraft now flies under the wind shear / micro-burst. The previous headwind decreases and the airspeed decreases. The aircraft now sinks due to the loss of energy and also the down draft. The angle of attack will decrease as the relative airflow is now coming from a higher orientation. Position 3 on the figure: The aircraft leaves the down draft but now encounters an increasing tail wind. This steals more energy and the airspeed decreases and the aircraft sinks further. Note: It is perhaps better to consider these questions in terms of the aircraft's energy: Headwind increasing / tailwind decreasing = gain of energy Tailwind increasing / headwind decreasing = loss of energy",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Before anything else, remember to fly the aircraft and maintain it under control. Only when time permits, communicate with ATC. Then the appropriate drill for the aircraft type must be carried out, which normally would include a shutdown checklist. When the fire has stopped, the engine should never be restarted, and an emergency landing follows in case of single-engine aircraft or loss of all engines. With regards to the landing itself, remember that flaps steepen the descent angle - in other words, you run the risk of falling short of the runway. So in a glide you keep the flaps up until you can be certain of making the landing point. Once the landing is guaranteed, you can then deploy gear as well as flap to slow down as much as possible - being aware that these actions will further reduce the gliding range, so constant reevaluation is required. Note: A precautionary landing is an expedited landing to a nearby airport when an immediate assistance and landing is not required, yest to continue the flight to its destination is considered unsafe. => This not the case. An emergency landing is required.",

            "explanation": "Wing tip vortices tend to sink below the flight path of the aircraft that generated them and flow outwards. Therefore, the succeding aircraft should stay above and upwind from the other aircraft's flight path. Upwind - the wind is “hitting” your airplane first and then the other. Downwind - wind is hitting the large plane first and, therefore, will move the vortices in the direction of your airplane (which is undesirable). If the wind is coming from the left, you should fly on the left side (and above) of the track of the preceding aircraft. Further info on WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

A cold weather start is a perfect scenario for an engine fire, particularly if we get carried away with the primer. Excess fuel makes its way into the carburetor intake, then the engine backfires through the carburetor, igniting the fuel along with the dirty air filter. The normal procedure is to keep cranking the engine if this happens. This should suck the flames back through the carburetor and extinguish the blaze, and if the engine starts, let it run for a minute or so, then shut it down and inspect the damage. If the engine doesn't start after cranking it for the time recommended by the checklist, shut down, evacuate the aircraft, and, if it's not already extinguished, use the extinguisher to put out the fire.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

The expected attitude of the aircraft in the water is almost always “nose up”, so that the rear doors will not be usable for evacuation. After the cabin crew identify all the usable exits and check that the slides/life rafts are deployed and inflated, the objective for them is to maintain an evenly distributed flow of passengers towards all available exits. Life jackets should be donned by all, but not inflated until outside the aircraft. If life rafts are carried, passengers should be briefed on the procedures for detachable escape slides at exits. Passengers should directly embark in the life rafts and not first in the water. When a person suddenly comes into contact with extremely cold water, they experience a cold shock response. The person will hyperventilate and take uncontrollable, deep and fast breaths for the next one or three minutes. If one goes underwater in this state, he/she could swallow water and drown. Whenever possible, after evacuation, link all the rafts together to maximize the visual target for the search parties. Cabin crew should ensure that passenger raft count does not exceed recommended raft capacity and attempt to assign crewmember(s) to each raft to establish command. Groups should be kept together and away from the aircraft, spilt fuel and debris. Split fuel could possibly be ignited, leading to a post-impact fire. Even if ignition sources were suppressed by the water, the inhalation and ingestion of fuel vapours can pose severe health risks to survivors. Each cabin crew member should check for any remaining passengers, and as soon as their assigned area is empty, evacuate the aircraft with survival kits.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

The holdover time begins at the start of the second (anti-icing) stage. The holdover time (HOT) is the estimated duration during which de-icing/anti-icing fluid remains effective. The aircraft must begin its takeoff roll within this time frame; otherwise, the entire process of de-icing followed by anti-icing must be repeated. Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. Note: High humidity often correlates with increased precipitation rates (e.g., rain, snow, sleet). Higher precipitation rates can overwhelm the fluid's ability to keep ice from forming, thus reducing its effective duration.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 9817 Manual on Low-level Wind Shear Take-off precautions Thrust setting 4.3.13 Maximum rated take-off thrust should be used for take-off. This shortens the take-off roll and reduces overrun exposure. Full thrust also provides the best rate of climb, thus increasing altitude available for recovery if required. Lastly, full thrust take-offs may eliminate resetting thrust in a recovery, thereby maximizing acceleration capability and reducing crew workload. Runway selection 4.3.14 Use the longest suitable runway that avoids suspected areas of wind shear. The choice of a suitable runway involves consideration of exposure to obstacles after lift-off and crosswind and tailwind Chapter 4. Effect of Low-level Wind Shear on Aircraft Performance 4-25 limitations. This assures maximum runway available to accelerate to rotation speed and may result in more ground clearance at the end of the runway and during the climb profile. Should the decision be made to reject the take-off, more runway is available on which to stop the aircraft. Take-off flap selection Take-off flap selection 4.3.15 The choice of take-off flap setting is dependent on the aircraft type. The flap settings in Table 4-2 should be considered unless limited by obstacle clearance and/or climb gradient. Studies of available take-off flap settings showed that the greater flap setting provided best performance for wind shear encounters on the runway. However, lesser flap settings showed the best performance for in-air wind shear encounters. The take-off flap settings given in Table 4-2 offered somewhat better performance over a wide range of conditions; however, it must be pointed out that the performance difference between flap settings is small. Increased airspeed 4.3.16 Increased airspeed at rotation improves the ability of the aircraft to negotiate a wind shear encountered after lift-off. Increased airspeed improves the flight path, reduces potential exposure to flight near stick-shaker speeds, and reduces pilot workload. 4.3.17 Delaying rotation to a higher airspeed may appear to increase the risk of overrunning available runway. However, because of the manner in which increased rotation speed is calculated, it is simply using the runway as if the aircraft was loaded to the field length limit mass for that runway. If the take-off is at field length limit conditions, the risk of overrunning the available runway is increased because there is no extra runway available. The overrun exposure is also increased if the wind shear reduces the airspeed below the minimum airspeed required for lift-off at the maximum available (body contact) attitude. However, initiating rotation no later than 600 m (2 000 ft) from the end of the usable runway surface reduces the probability of overrun and maximizes the available energy after lift-off Note: Table 4-2 suggest flap settings for different aircrafts.",

This is a dangerous goods question, referring to both the oxygen and to the radioactive substances in the medicine. These would usually be considered as dangerous goods, and the technical instructions would be consulted as to whether they can be brought on board or not, as well as their packaging, location, etc. The learning objective above eludes to the fact that for aeromedical flights, this is not strictly required, and the states involved (state of departure, overflight, destination, operator) may grant an exemption to the rules on a case-by-case basis.

A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, gradually developing engine trouble, darkness approaching faster than anticipated (when the pilot does not have night flying experience).

            "explanation": "Looking at the answers: 'Take-off with all de-icing and anti-icing equipment on.' --> INCORRECT. The aircraft already has freezing rain on the windshield. You must respect the Clean Aircraft Concept and have the aircraft properly de-iced and anti-iced prior to departure. The aircraft's own systems are designed for protection in flight, along the leading edges, and will not provide adequate protection on the ground. 'Have the aircraft inspected as the flight control surfaces might be jammed by frozen water residues in the tracks.' --> CORRECT. Not the greatest answer but the only possible correct one here. A pre de-icing check is valuable to confirm the amount and type of contamination and to determine what type and concentration of fluid etc to use. 'Take off anyway as the turn-around is quick.' --> INCORRECT. The aircraft is already contaminated and the Clean Aircraft Concept must be respected. 'Have your aircraft de-iced requesting double the usual amount of spraying of flight control surface tracks, slots and other possible places of ice accumulation.' --> INCORRECT. Why use double the usual amount of de-icing fluid? Also the question indicates falling precipitation, which would require anti-icing as well. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 2. The Clean Aircraft Concept (CAC) 2.2 An aeroplane is considered to be clean when all surfaces are completely clean or when surfaces are protected by de-icing/anti-icing fluids and the surface aerodynamic characteristics are unaffected 2.3 During conditions conductive to aeroplane icing during operations, take-off must not be attempted when ice, snow, slush or frost is present or adhering to the wings, propellers, control surfaces, engine inlets or other critical surfaces.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. The wear of carbon brakes is primarily determined by the total number of brake applications. A single firm brake application causes less wear compared to multiple light applications. To minimize wear and maximize the lifespan of carbon brakes during taxi, it is recommended to employ a strategy of using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications rather than frequent, light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing the taxi speed to increase and then utilizing a single firm brake application to reduce the speed. If necessary, this process can be repeated as needed, instead of maintaining a constant taxi speed through numerous brake applications. By following this approach, the minimum wear and maximum longevity of carbon brakes can be achieved during taxi operations. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. In this case, any further taxiing and brake use will worsen the situation. Therefore, the aircraft should be stopped and the parking brakes should not be applied.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

Flying faster does not necessarily help, it would enhance any turbulence. 'Try to climb above the clouds' and 'Climb to a optimum FL and increase your pitch' --> INCORRECT. Climbing is not really an option as being able to out climb such weather is very unlikely. Furthermore, increasing the pitch, only puts the aircraft closer to the critical angle of attack. 'Maintain present FL, knowing also that ice may form and give you unreliable altitude and airspeed readout' --> CORRECT.

            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.7. The HOT begins with the start of the de-icing/anti-icing application in the case of a one-step operation, or the beginning of anti-icing in a two-step process and ends after an elapsed time equal to the appropriate HOT. A pilot must monitor the time elapsed from the start of the HOT identified and ensure that taxi and take-off are achieved before the HOT elapses. If not, additional de-icing/anti-icing will be required. CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. In this case, the fact that snow has started to accumulate on the windshield may indicate that the HOT has probably expired due to the jet blast from the preceeding Boeing 747, which reduces HOT. Therefore, the take-off cannot be performed within the time of effectiveness of the first application anda second application is necessary. Note that it is important that the aircraft is not only re-coated with the protective fluid (anti-ice) but also washed properly (de-iced) => the original anti-ice might have been diluted and frozen to the aircraft's surface.",

Note: This question is not very realistic, but you just have to look past the ridiculousness and give the examiner what they want to hear, and remember that they are testing your knowledge of a very specific learning objective. WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Pilots should be particularly alert in calm wind or light winds of 3 to 7 knots conditions and where the vortices could stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. Calm wind conditions are most dangerous as wake turbulence stagnates on the runway and is not blown to one side. Runway 25R: Wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft or adjacent runway 25C could blow back onto the runway. Runway 25C: Due to the calm wind conditions, vortices from the preceding aircraft will stagnate in the area of the runway. They might move outwards slowly, but this is still quite a dangerous situation to have. Runway 25L: The wind is coming from ahead and from the right (westerly at 3 kt). The wake turbulence will be blown along the runway and the right hand vortices will get blown onto the runway. Runway 18: the wind is blowing with a fairly high speed from the right, so the wake turbulence is most likely to clear.",

There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

            "explanation": "There are two noise abatement departure procedures (NADP): NADP 1: for close in noise sensitive areas. The philosophy is to reduce the noise by reducing engine thrust settings but to maintain a steep climb to get away from the ground. This precludes retracting flaps / slats as this would need an acceleration, which would keep the aircraft lower for longer. No lower than 800 ft above ground level (AGL), reduce engine thrust Do not accelerate but continue to climb at V2 + 10 to 20 kts Continue climb to 3000 ft AGL, and now accelerate and retract the flaps / slats NADP 2: for distant noise sensitive areas. The philosophy here is to use the airspace before reaching the noise sensitive area, to accelerate and retract the flaps / slats and then climb at a high performance with a clean wing. Once the noise sensitive area is reached, the aircraft will be higher than with the technique of NADP 1. No lower than 800 ft AGL, accelerate and clean up the flaps / slats Once clean, climb at a suitable high performance climb speed In both NADP 1 and 2, the lowest level to initiate an action is 800ft AGL and the procedure effectively ends at 3000 ft AGL as the aircraft is now high enough. Looking at the answers: Initially climb WITHOUT accelerating or reducing thrust. At 1500 ft AGL reduces thrust. At or above 3000 ft AGL reduces the climb rate to accelerate and retract flaps/ slats. --> CORRECT. This answer matches NADP 1. Thrust (noise) is reduced with no acceleration. Although 1500 ft is higher than 800 ft, remember the regulation is that no action is taken below 800 ft, so 1500 ft is a valid answer. The procedure then ends at 3000 ft as the aircraft finally accelerates and retracts flaps / slats. Climb with maximum thrust and accelerate to retract flaps and slats as soon as possible. Continue the climb in a clean configuration. Maintain 250 KIAS below FL100. --> INCORRECT. NADP 1 does not allow for acceleration and clean up 'as soon as possible'. Initially climb with maximum thrust and WITHOUT accelerating. At or above 800 ft AGL reduce thrust and accelerate to retract the flaps/slats. --> INCORRECT. NADP 1 does not allow for acceleration and retraction of flaps/slats at 800 ft. This happens at 3000 ft. After lift-off immediately reduces thrust. Maintain V2+10 KIAS and at or above 3000 ft AGL reduce the climb rate to accelerate and retract flaps/slats. --> INCORRECT. 'After lift-off immediately.' is wrong. No actions below 800 ft allowed.",

The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

Increasing the angle of attack is exactly the opposite from what the pilot should do - the AF447 pilot reacted by pitching up, which led to an aerodynamic stall. Furthermore, the question explicitly states that there is no way around it, which means that climbing is not a solution. \"Descend below clouds.\" Incorrect.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

The second procedure (NADP 2) provides noise reduction to areas more distant from the runway end. NADP 1 prioritises noise abatement for areas close to the airport, by keeping the take-off flap/slat setting the same until 3000ft, but doing a thrust reduction at or above 800ft (can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). The aircraft only accelerates to remove flaps when 3000ft has been reached, as the act of accelerating the aircraft reduces the climb gradient, which makes the aircraft closer to the ground in a potentially noise sensitive zone. The initial climbing speed to the noise abatement initiation point shall not be less than V2 + 20 km/h (10 kt). On reaching an altitude at or above 240 m (800 ft) above aerodrome elevation, adjust and maintain power/thrust in accordance with the noise abatement power/thrust schedule provided in the aircraft operating manual. Maintain a climb speed of V2 + 20 to 40 km/h (10 to 20 kt) with flaps and slats in the take-off configuration. At no more than an altitude equivalent to 900 m (3 000 ft) above aerodrome elevation, while maintaining a positive rate of climb, accelerate and retract flaps/slats on schedule.

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Similar to VSI, the cabin rate of climb is sensitive to rates of change of pressure and indicate the rate of change of cabin (apparent) altitude in an aircraft’s pressurized cabin. When it shows a rate of climb: it means that the cabin altitude is increasing => at a higher altitude, pressure decreases. Therefore, the pressure inside the cabin is reducing. Consequently, the differential pressure (difference between cabin pressure and atmospheric pressure) decreases. Conversely, when it indicates a rate of descent: it means that the cabin altitude is decreasing => at a lower altitude, pressure increases. Therefore, the pressure inside the cabin is increasing. Consequently, the differential pressure increases.",

            "explanation": "Looking at the answers: 'Pre-event decompression training' --> INCORRECT. Prior training will assist the crew in handling the situation but will have no effect on the time of useful consciousness. 'Aircraft speed' --> INCORRECT. The aircraft's speed has no effect. The time of useful consciousness will be the same if you are flying at 100 kts or 400 kts. 'Altitude' --> CORRECT. The time of useful consciousness is based on altitude, as the air becomes thinner with altitude and less oxygen is available. 'The time of day' --> INCORRECT. The time of useful consciousness is unaffected by the time of day. Whether it is day or night, you will have the same amount of time depending on your vertical level. Time of Useful Consciousness (TUC) refers to the duration available to a pilot before experiencing hypoxia and being able to take corrective actions following a loss of sufficient oxygen supply, which can occur due to decompression. In simpler terms, TUC represents the period during which the pilot remains effectively conscious. Typically, it is considered the point when individuals can no longer assist themselves. TUC varies based on the altitude at which the pilot is flying and the pilot's health, such as the influence of smoking, which can lead to a shorter TUC. Moreover, engaging in increased physical activity during interrupted oxygen supply results in a greater demand for oxygen, further reducing the TUC. When a crew member is on board a pressurized aircraft that experiences cabin pressurization loss, as in the case of rapid decompression, TUC becomes a crucial consideration. Here is the relationship between Altitude and TUC for a person at rest, with the source being official Learning Objective 040 02 01 02 Respiratory and circulatory systems: At 20 000 ft, the TUC is approximately 30 minutes (or 5 minutes when the person is moderately active). At 25 000 ft, the TUC reduces to 2 - 3 minutes. At 30 000 ft, the TUC further decreases to 1 - 2 minutes. At 35 000 ft, the TUC becomes 30 - 90 seconds. At 40 000 ft, the TUC significantly diminishes to 15 - 20 seconds",

These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

Looking at the answers: 'Impact on the mass and balance of the aeroplane since the upward and downward components of the airflow may cause significant pitching of the aeroplane' --> INCORRECT. Mountain waves will no effect on the mass and balance of the aircraft, despite the pitching oscillations, if the load is properly secured. 'Likelihood of significant clear air icing as a result of the air being forced over the mountains, creating an effect where ice may form outside clouds' --> INCORRECT. Despite wandering even further into the Meteorology syllabus, clear air icing is not a feature of mountain waves. 'Performance of the aeroplane as the downward component at the back of the waves may be greater than the achievable rate of climb' --> CORRECT. On the lee side of the terrain, the aircraft could encounter very strong down drafts. It is certainly possible that the air is descending more quickly than the aircraft can climb. 'Risks of entering the area where the waves exist because the rate of climb may exceed what the aeroplane is capable of controlling' --> INCORRECT. Behind the lee of the mountain is an area of down drafts as the air sinks down with the terrain. Exceeding the rate of climb ability of the aircraft is exactly the opposite of the problem encountered.",

As you approach the microcurst, you will experience a headwind which results in a sudden increased airspeed. Consequently, lift increases and the aircraft \"ballons\". As decribed in the question text. As you fly through the microburst, the wind will change and the headwind decreases. As you fly immediately under it, strong downdrafts will be experienced which may be enough to force the aircraft into the ground or at least cause it to lose a significant amount of height. The next stage should be anticipated, as severe energy loss can be expected beyond the centre of the microburst. At this stage, the tailwind increases resulting in a sudden reduction of airspeeds which causes the lift to decrease. As a consequence, the aicraft will sink. If the windshear is too severe, a go-around should be immediately executed. When windshear is encountered, crew must assess whether safe flight parameters can be maintained or not. If yes, the approach may be continued. If not, a go-around must be initiated without delay. Flight parameters must be carefully monitored.",

High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. HYDROPLANING SPEED CALCULATIONS: Rotating Tyres formula (applies to rejected take-offs): V = 9 √ P NON-Rotating Tyres formula (applies to touchdown): V = 7.7 √ P Where V stands for velocity (kt) and P is tyre pressure (PSI) In this case, the aircraft is taking off: V = 9 √ 200 = approx. 127 kt => Take-off must be aborted up to V1, consequently, we must make sure that V1 is lower than the speed for Dynamic Hydroplaning 127 kt.

            "explanation": "DITCHING Ditching an aircraft into the sea, a river, or a lake, is a manoeuvre that, by definition, cannot be practiced and may be extremely hazardous. It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft. 3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending. 5. You encounter more turbulence as you enter the final vortex. If you haven't already hit the ground, you may begin to climb again as you exit the vortex.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

WINDSHEAR: Descent and approach When wind shear conditions are anticipated, the approach and landing should be delayed until conditions improve, or the aircraft should divert to a more suitable airport. Select the most favourable holding point, approach path and runway, considering the location of the likely wind shear condition, and the available runway approach aids. Select less than full flaps for landing (to maximize the climb gradient capability and provide a wider margin between stall and flap overspeed) and adjust the final approach speed accordingly. If an ILS is available, engage the autopilot for a more accurate approach tracking. Closely monitor the airspeed, speed trend and ground speed during the approach to detect any evidence of imminent wind shear. If the presence of wind shear is confirmed, be prepared for a possible missed approach and escape maneuver. If the aircraft passes through a windshear line from a tailwind to a headwind component, the inertia of the aircraft results initially in an increased airspeed and a deviation above the glidepath. The pilot's instinctive power reduction can result in the aircraft being short of power with a high rate of descent as the glidepath is approached and the effect of the inertia is lost. A rapid increase of power is now required if the aircraft is not to sink below the glidepath at a dangerously low altitude. The aircraft should be stabilised by a certain point on the approach, but that is up to the procedures followed, and being stabilised by 800ft is an arbitrary value, so is not correct.",

This goes against what is commonly believed (and taught). The reason for a fuel jettison system is not actually to get below MLM, as most people think, but instead is to get light enough to fulfil the requirements for minimum climb gradients (such as landing climb or OEI approach climb). If the aircraft can fulfill all these climb requirements at the MTOM (minus a short 15 minute flight), then it does not need a fuel jettison system at all (such as the B737 and A320 family). The reason is that an overweight landing is not a massive problem (the aircraft is checked afterwards but it is not likely to be a problem at the time), but the climb performance on a go-around needs to be acceptable to avoid terrain, as that is very important to avoid a disastrous accident.",

In this case, any further taxiing and brake use will worsen the situation. Therefore, the aircraft should be stopped and the parking brakes should not be applied.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

Most of us would say not, but there is an 'emer' selection on the CDPLC as This requires the press of just the relevant line select key to initiate. Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) using the FANS 1/A network has become the primary means of communicating with ATC in oceanic regions around the world and is also implemented in several domestic regions as well. One function of FANS CPDLC no crew ever wants to have to use is emergency reporting. During an emergency, the flight crew would normally revert to voice communications. However, the crew may use CPDLC for emergency communications if it is either more expedient or if voice contact cannot be established. When a MAYDAY or PAN message is sent via CPDLC, the ADS-C emergency mode is automatically activated. An ADS-C periodic report is automatically transmitted and tagged as “emergency” to highlight the situation to ATC. The emergency periodic reports continue to be transmitted until ADS Emergency is selected to OFF. ADS Emergency is located on the ATC LOGON STATUS page 2/2 (figure 3). ATC will respond with appropriate acknowledgements and clearances via CPDLC.",

Airframe icing can be a large problem for flight, and it forms in many different ways. In flight, airframe icing occurs due to supercooled water droplets hitting a cold airframe, or due to hoar frost, etc., but this means that it forms very differently to icing on the ground, which often forms due to rain falling on the cold airframe, slush, snow build-up, etc. These often look totally different, with in-flight icing building up on the leading edges of the wings, engines and aircraft nose, and with ground icing looking like snow on the wings, icicles hanging off the surfaces, slush in the wheel wells, etc. That is why we can't really say that one or the other is \"worst\", as both types of icing are so different.",

Follow the procedures in DOC 7030 3. Split levels to regain some separation. For example climb or descend by 500 ft if normal separation is 1000 ft. More details from: ICAO ANNEX 2 - Attachment B. Unlawful Interference General The following procedures are intended as guidance for use by aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the aircraft is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact. Procedures If the pilot-in-command cannot proceed to an aerodrome in accordance with the rules in chapter 3, 3.7.2., he/she should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until able to notify an ATS unit or until within radar or ADS-B coverage. When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible: a) Attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc., should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and b) Proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contigencies, where such procedures have been established and promulgated in DOC 7030 - Regional Supplementary Procedures; or c) If no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area by 300 m (1000 ft) if above FL290 or by 150 m (500 ft) if below FL290.",

Wake turbulence occurs due to the wingtip vortices formed by an aircraft, largest when heavy and flying slowly. The vortices are the effect of air travelling from the underside of the wing, around the wingtip, and onto the upper side of the wing. This means that the swirl direction is upwards at and outside the wingtips, but is downwards between the wingtips of an aircraft. This causes quite a significant downdraft, enough to make the vortices travel downwards generally, as shown in the second annex above. In the case of the trailing aircraft which is taking pictures, it would be represented by the first annex above (although much closer to the lead aircraft), as its right wing would be in the downdraft area behind the large aircraft wing, but its left wing would be in the updraft area outside of the wingtip, therefore it would want to roll to the right, potentially uncontrollably. It is important to note that this question is slightly ambiguous on the exact location of the trailing aircraft, but that for a large range of positions, this same right roll effect would occur. Most likely, severe turbulence would also be felt.",

We don't know which runway the preceding heavy aircraft is landing on, so simply landing on a different runway, applying proper separation or approaching on a higher glide path will have to wait for the real world. Regarding wake turbulence and wind conditions: Calm wind: wake vortices will persist for approximately 3 minutes and slowly roll outwards and apart. This is not desirable as the lack of wind means the vortices can remain on the runway for some time. Light crosswind: The downwind vortex will be blown off the runway. The upwind vortex, however, can be pushed back, remaining on the runway for longer than in calm winds. A light crosswind will not be strong enough to break up the vortices. Strong crosswind: A strong wind will break apart vortices. The crosswind component will additionally help to blow any vortices clear of the runway. More information on WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wingtips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced when the aircraft is Heavy Slow In a clean configuration",

This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Pilots should be particularly alert in calm wind or light winds of 3 to 7 knots conditions and where the vortices could stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. Calm wind conditions are most dangerous as wake turbulence stagnates on the runway and is not blown to one side. In a slow hover taxi or stationary hover near the surface, helicopter main rotor(s) generate downwash producing high velocity outwash vortices to a distance approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. When rotor downwash hits the surface, the resulting outwash vortices have behavioral characteristics similar to wing tip vortices produced by fixed wing aircraft. However, the vortex circulation is outward, upward, around, and away from the main rotor(s) in all directions. Pilots of small aircraft should avoid operating within three rotor diameters of any helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover. In forward flight, departing or landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind or crossing behind landing and departing helicopters.",

The airspeed increases and the aircraft floats up above the flight profile. Position 2 on the figure: The aircraft now flies under the wind shear / micro-burst. The previous headwind decreases and the airspeed decreases. The aircraft now sinks due to the loss of energy and also the down draft. The angle of attack will decrease as the relative airflow is now coming from a higher orientation.

            "explanation": "Birds can be a serious threat to airplanes, especially during takeoff, landing, and low-altitude manoeuvres. Birds can damage engines, clog windshields, or create other dangerous conditions when they collide with an aircraft. Airports and aviation authorities deploy a variety of bird scare techniques to reduce the danger of bird strikes. Bird control at airports may be accomplished by using bird distress calls. Bird distress calls are imitations of a bird's distress call that are produced by recordings or electrical equipment. Other birds may hear these distress sounds as a warning and a threatening atmosphere, judging the place to be unsafe and deciding to fly away. It's crucial to remember that the exact bird species, surrounding circumstances, and frequency of use can all affect how effective bird distress calls are. If birds understand there is no serious threat nearby, they may grow accustomed to frequent distress calls. It is often necessary to combine distress calls with other bird scaring techniques to enhance their effectiveness.",

The cabin altitude is closely controlled to simulate a lower altitude, typically around 6 000 to 8 000 feet. If there is a failure in the pressurization system, the cabin altitude may start to increase. As the cabin altitude rises, the air pressure inside the aircraft decreases, and this can lead to discomfort in the ears. A narrow passage called the eustachian tube regulates air pressure in your ear. When a plane climbs or descends, the air pressure changes quickly, and your eustachian tube often doesn't react quickly enough. This difference in pressure between the middle ear and the cabin can result in the sensation of an \"ear pop\". The discomfort and \"popping\" sensation in the ears are typically signs of the body adjusting to changes in pressure. \"If the oxygen pressure is also dropping, there could be an oxygen system failure.\" Incorrect. The oxygen pressure is not relevant. \"If the cabin pressure increases, it could be due to an entry door or cargo door opening.\" Incorrect.

It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or ‘popping’, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive (fast) decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 071.02.01.03.06: Explain the responsibilities of the commander with regard to MEL. Always read the question very carefully. The first sentence states “…you found that your AUTOPILOT (singular) doesn’t work, …”. This line implies that the particular aircraft in question is only fitted with one autopilot system, which happens to be currently unserviceable - I.e., we have no autopilot available to use in flight. I appreciate the B737 would normally have 2 autopilots fitted, and the ‘number installed’ field as ‘-’ doesn’t clarify the situation. However, when you see this blank/dashed field, it normally means the MEL is not MSN specific, and that the number installed can vary, dependent on that particular aircraft’s configuration (some 737s in the operator’s fleet may have 2 autopilots installed, others in the fleet may only have one). The annex states 1 autopilot is required, but “may be inoperative provided approach minimums do not require its use”. This means, we cannot perform any approach that requires an autoland. Therefore, the lowest approach minima we can use is CAT I (200 ft AGL, 550 m visibility). You need to know that autoland is mandatory for LTS CAT I, CAT II, LTS CAT II, CAT IIIA and CAT IIIB. Therefore, without any autopilot, none of these approach types are possible, as they all require at least one operational autopilot (or 2 operational autopilots in the case of CAT IIIB). As a result, the correct answer is no, you cannot carry out a CAT II approach, because CAT II requires autoland, and therefore 1 autopilot. 2 autopilots are only required for CAT IIIB approaches. CAT II approaches cannot be flown manually. Note: MSN = manufacturer serial number LTS = lower than standard",

As of yet we do not have enough information to change this question or correct answer so please continue to provide as much feedback as possible and we may be able to align fully with the EASA exams, thank you. Learning Objective 071.02.11.01.03: Explain how flaps and slats may adversely affect fuel jettisoning. Fuel jettisoning is required to be a feature on any CS25 aircraft that could take off at its MTOW and in case of an emergency landing after only 15 minutes of flight, would not be safe to land at that weight (specifically it is in reference to the missed approach climb gradients). Therefore, those such aircraft are required to have a system to rapidly jettison fuel to lose enough weight to become safe for landing and a potential go-around. Jettisoning usually occurs from a valve at the rear of each wing (from the main fuel tanks), and therefore, the use of flaps/slats changes the airflow around this area, and might interfere with the fuel jettisoning, by reducing the flow rate due to pressure changes, turbulent/stalled airflow, etc. Therefore, the jettisoning of fuel with high lift devices extended must be checked in the aircraft's certification process, and a placard will be in place if jettisoning is restricted by the use of flaps/slats. (see below) CS 25.1001 Fuel jettisoning system (h) Unless it is shown that using any means (including flaps, slots and slats) for changing the airflow across or around the wings does not adversely affect fuel jettisoning, there must be a placard, adjacent to the jettisoning control, to warn flight-crew members against jettisoning fuel while the means that change the airflow are being used.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or ‘popping’, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive (fast) decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. Air to escape violently and too fast from the lungs and other air-filled cavities in the body such as the sinuses and eustachian tubes, typically resulting in severe to fatal barotrauma. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

As a result, the pilot may receive error indications, which could include alerts about abnormal engine performance or potential limitations on power output. Source: ICAO Doc 9640 The Air Florida Flight 90 crash serves as a poignant example of human error leading to tragedy. Despite evident snowfall, the pilots overlooked icing conditions. They also failed to adequately remove ice buildup before takeoff, resulting in diminished lift and increased drag. Furthermore, despite sub-freezing temperatures and snowfall, the crew neglected to activate the engine anti-ice system. This system, utilizing engine heat, prevents sensor freezing, ensuring accurate readings. During the pre-takeoff checklist, a crucial conversation unfolded between the captain (CAM-1) and the first officer (CAM-2): CAM-2: Pitot heat? CAM-1: On. CAM-2: Engine anti-ice? CAM-1: Off. Despite the freezing conditions, the crew omitted to activate the engine anti-ice systems, leading to erroneous readings on the engine pressure ratio (EPR) thrust indicators. The correct power setting for the prevailing conditions at Washington National Airport was 2.04 EPR. However, analysis of cockpit voice recorder data revealed that the actual power output corresponded to a mere 1.70 EPR.",

Flying through the microburst: When the aircraft flies through the microburst, the wind conditions change. The headwind decreases, and strong downdrafts are experienced as the aircraft passes underneath the microburst. However, during this phase, the horizontal wind speed is reduced to 0 knots. Beyond the center of the microburst: After passing through the center of the microburst, the wind conditions shift again. The tailwind increases, leading to a sudden reduction in airspeed. The decrease in airspeed results in decreased lift, causing the aircraft to sink.

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. => Out of the available options, an uncontrollable fire will force the aircraft to land as soon as possible. All remaining options offer the possibility to continue flying to attempt landing at an off-airport. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode. Water spray will cool the air in the fire zone but not directly the wheel. Statement 2 refers to a spray atomizer - meaning that only some kind of steam or water vapour is used, which cools much slower.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "In this question, the aircraft is still parked on stand and awaiting clearance. While a visual inspection from inside the aircraft is an option, it would only allow a view of the main wing normally. If time permits an external inspection would be preferable as the pilot could possibly inspect all critical surfaces and also perform a tactile test for clear ice. The Learning Objective states: The pre-take-off check, which is the responsibility of the pilot-in-command, ensures that the critical surfaces of the aircraft are free of ice, snow, slush or frost just prior to take-off. This check shall be accomplished as close to the time of take-off as possible and is normally made from within the aeroplane by visually checking the wings. The current feedback indicates that the correct answer is an external check, as the aircraft is still on the apron. Later, a pre-take-off check, at the holding point for example, and internally made would be the option. Further information here from EASA AIR OPS and ICAO Doc 9640 CAT. OP. MPA.250 Ice and other contaminants - ground procedures: ‘Pre-take-off check’: The flight crew should continuously monitor the weather conditions after the de-icing/anti-icing treatment to assess whether the applied holdover time is still appropriate. Within the aircraft’s HOT and prior to take-off, the flight crew should check the aircraft’s wings or representative aircraft surfaces for frozen contaminants. ‘Pre-take-off contamination check’: a check of the treated surfaces for contamination, performed when the HOT has been exceeded or if any doubt exists regarding the continued effectiveness of the applied anti-icing treatment. It is normally accomplished externally, just before commencement of the take-off run. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 2. The Clean Aircraft Concept (CAC) 2.2 An aeroplane is considered to be clean when all surfaces are completely clean or when surfaces are protected by de-icing/anti-icing fluids and the surface aerodynamic characteristics are unaffected 2.3 During conditions conductive to aeroplane icing during operations, take-off must not be attempted when ice, snow, slush or frost is present or adhering to the wings, propellers, control surfaces, engine inlets or other critical surfaces.",

Wet ice is ice that is melting, or ice with a layer of water (any depth) on top. The various braking action of each surface is quite easy to work out. Compacted snow has a relatively rough surface, and with heavy weight will allow some movement of the snow beneath, allowing for some traction between tyres and the surface, especially if the tyres have good tread for snow operations. This will allow moderate and moderate-to-poor braking action in many cases. Ice, on the other hand, will not move, nor allow any purchase with treaded tyres (unless they are studded), but dry ice (not frozen carbon dioxide used in smoke machines) will at least have a small amount of traction with a (usually) grippy rubber tyre surface. Still, moderate-to-poor and poor braking action can be expected. Wet ice has the same downsides of ice, but now that top level traction is nearly completely gone, and the braking action can be expected to be poor to non-existent.",

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. The expected attitude of the aircraft in the water is always \"nose up\". In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

An ice-contaminated wing will stall at a lower angle of attack or higher airspeed than a clean wing (increased stall speed). The additional weight of the ice or snow adds to the total weight of the aircraft, increasing the lift required for the aircraft to take off. Consequently, the take-off distance also increases.

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off. This depends on the aircraft's mass, the speed when braking was commenced, the intensity of brakes applied and the ambient temperatures.",

Move passengers away from the immediate area, and remove any flammable items and have fire extinguishers ready in case. Considerations upon receiving a bomb threat in-flight: Large and rapid changes to pressure altitude should be avoided. If operationally possible, reduce the cabin differential pressure to zero by descending the aircraft to cabin altitude. Do not raise the cabin altitude. Maintain this cabin altitude until top of descent. When minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) and range considerations permit, descend aircraft to below 10 000 feet. Minimise manoeuvres and try to avoid turbulence. Consider carefully the choice between flying fast to minimise airborne time and flying slowly to minimise air loads and damage in the event of fuselage rupture. In most cases, the turbulent air penetration speed will be a reasonable compromise. Consider establishing landing configuration as soon as possible. If the bomb does go off and damages aircraft systems (hydraulic and/or electrical), the aircraft is already ready to be landed. On contacting the airfield of landing, request details of remote parking requirements and immediate availability of passenger steps. Advise airfield of need to remove passengers from vicinity of the aircraft to at least 200m in an upwind direction as quickly as possible.",

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

Even if the decision is made to continue, the recognition of external wind shear signs should alert the pilot to pay close attention to the progress of the landing or takeoff by reference to the flight deck instruments. External clues that may be directly visible to the pilot include the following: a) strong, gusty surface winds, especially where the aerodrome is located near hills or where there are comparatively large buildings near the runway, indicating the possibility of local wind shear and turbulence; b) lenticular cloud (smooth lens-shaped altocumulus) indicating the presence of standing waves, usually downwind from a mountain; c) virga, i.e. precipitation falling from the base of a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground (especially under convective cloud) because downdrafts may still exist and reach the ground even though the precipitation itself has evaporated; d) roll cloud girding the base of a thunderstorm and advancing ahead of the rain belt, indicating the presence of a gust front; e) areas of dust raised by wind, particularly when in the form of a ring below convective clouds, indicating the presence of a downburst; f) wind socks responding to different winds; g) smoke plumes sheared, with upper and lower sections moving in different directions; and h) thunderstorms, which should always be assumed to have the capability of producing hazardous wind shear.

To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

Icing on the ground happens primarily due to hoar frost, cold-soaked fuel frost, freezing rain, and ground contamination. For instance, the wheel wells would not usually build up any ice in flight, but any snow, slush or cold water can get splashed up into them on the ground, particularly during taxi, which can lead to mechanical problems with the gear retraction, etc. In flight, icing primarily occurs due to the accretion of super-cooled water droplets onto the leading edge surfaces, which can form rime, clear or mixed ice. Freezing rain can also occur, but it will form differently than if the aircraft were on the ground, due to the high airflow causing the droplets to drip down the aircraft surfaces. This is before considering the effects of any in flight anti-icing/de-icing systems and on the ground anti-icing/de-icing processes. It is not possible to determine which builds up more ice, being on the ground or in flight, as the conditions are very different. Icing is also very critical on the ground or in flight, as a take-off without removing icing can be disastrous. Therefore, we only have one option left (the most vague one) which is that they are different, and can occur in different places and in different amounts, which is completely true.",

            "explanation": "IN-FLIGHT FIRE Fire in the air is one of the most hazardous situations that a flight crew can be faced with. Without aggressive intervention by the flight crew, a fire on board an aircraft can lead to the catastrophic loss of that aircraft within a very short space of time. The axiom “Aviate, Navigate, Communicate” teaches pilots to fly the airplane first, then navigate, and once the situation is under control, communicate. This is one of the rules that pilots should live by! This is a common approach to all flying situations, especially emergency conditions. Before anything else, remember to fly the aircraft and maintain it under control. Only when time permits, communicate with ATC. Then the appropriate drill for the aircraft type must be carried out, which normally would include turning off the cabin recirculation fans and going to override on the avionics blower and extract valves, in order to start eliminating the smoke, and turning the power to the galleys and cabin accessories off. Most critically, if the source of the smoke cannot be positively identified or the fire immediately extinguished, the flight crew must initiate diversion, ditching or landing off-airfield immediately. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Option (a) \"The actions to be taken by the crew may be type specific\" is correct with regard to smoke and fire in the cabin. The actions that the crew should take in the event of smoke or fire in the cabin can vary depending on the type of aircraft and the procedures established by the operator. Therefore, it is important for the crew to be familiar with the specific procedures and emergency checklists for their aircraft type. Option (b) \"Opening the checklist is the highest priority\" is not correct. The highest priority in the event of smoke or fire in the cabin is to immediately initiate the appropriate emergency procedures, which may include donning oxygen masks, and beginning an emergency descent. Option (c) \"A MAYDAY call should be transmitted first\" is also not correct. While it is important to transmit a MAYDAY call to air traffic control in the event of an emergency, the immediate actions taken by the crew to control the situation and ensure the safety of the passengers and crew are the highest priority. Option (d) \"Immediately open the cockpit security door\" is also not correct. Opening the cockpit security door during an emergency situation could compromise the safety and security of the flight deck. The crew should follow established procedures and protocols for responding to smoke or fire in the cabin. Furthermore, if there is smoke/fumes in the cabin, you want to keep it away from the flight deck as much as possible, by keeping the door closed.",

It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

They are used in the second step of a two-step procedure Type III is used in the same way as type II and IV, but is designed for slow speed aircraft. No anti-icing protection is effective indefinitely, there is a time limit during which the anti-icing protection can be considered reliable, this is the HOLDOVER TIME. Looking at the 4 answers to this question: Protection time up to 24 hours → INCORRECT as this is far too long in duration. Holdover times vary as listed below, but are usually measured in minutes, not days. Protection against icing for the duration of the flight → INCORRECT as anti-ice fluid is designed for ground use and to protect the airframe until take-off. In-flight protection would be offered from the aircraft's own systems, such as boots or bleed air. Limited holdover time depending on outside air temperature → CORRECT as outside air temperature is a factor in determining the holdover time. See below for more details on these factors. Limited time of protection independent of the outside temperature → INCORRECT as outside air temperature is a factor for the holdover time. See below for more details on these factors. The factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and Holdover Time include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature).",

Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch up— way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. We’re flying at the edge of the stall because that’s where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, it’s best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until you’re safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you can’t afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

How to Use a Fire Extinguisher Even though extinguishers come in a number of shapes and sizes, they all operate in a similar manner. Here's an easy acronym for fire extinguisher use: P A S S -- Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep (1) Hold the fire extinguisher upright. Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher that keeps the handle from being accidentally pressed; (2) Aim the nozzle toward the base of the fire; (3) Stand approximately 8 feet (2.5 m) away from the fire and squeeze the handle to discharge the extinguisher. If you release the handle, the discharge will stop; (4) Sweep the nozzle back and forth at the base of the fire and slowly move forward to extinguish the remaining fire. After the fire appears to be out, watch it carefully since it may re-ignite!",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. Without wind the vortices arrive on the parallel runway at a speed of 5 kts, endangering the operations on this runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots crosswind, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, the wind will tend to keep the upwind side of the wake in the runway area and may cause the downwind side to drift toward another runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off until touchdown. 2. The engines action (propellers rotation or engine gas exhausts) --> INCORRECT. This will disturb the airflow behind the engine, but does not contribute to wake turbulence, which is from wingtip vortices. 3. The importance of the drag devices (size of the landing gear, of the flaps, etc.) --> INCORRECT. Wake turbulence is caused by wingtip vortices. The use of flaps will affect the amount of turbulence, (lowering flaps decreases wake turbulence) but is not a main contributor in creating it, which is the question here.

            ],
            "explanation": "Looking at the answers: 'Total loss of one of the three available hydraulic systems, on an aircraft with flight controls that are hydraulically powered.' --> INCORRECT. Only one of three hydraulic systems has failed. This would lead the crew into the abnormal check list, but at this stage, seems unlikely to require an emergency landing. The aircraft would operate normally on the remaining two systems. 'An in-flight fire in the forward galley that has been positively identified as extinguished.' --> INCORRECT. An in-flight fire would be an interesting answer here, but this option then states that the fire is now extinguished. 'A total loss of the automatic pressurisation system just after take-off requiring manual intervention by the crew.' --> INCORRECT. Although the automatic system has failed, the crew have identified the issue and have regained control through manual intervention. There is no need for an emergency landing at this time. 'Multiple bird strikes during the take-off roll that cause an engine failure and erratic operation of the remaining engine.' --> CORRECT. Not a perfect answer as there is no mention of when the bird strikes occurred in relation to V1. However, the question asks about an emergency landing so an assumption could be made that the examiner is thinking after V1. Besides, all the other answers are a lot weaker. TYPES OF EMERGENCY LANDINGS The different types of emergency landings are defined as follows: Forced landing—an immediate landing, on or off an airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further flight. A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing engine trouble. Ditching—a forced or precautionary landing on water.",

The intensity of radioactive material is measured in transport indices (TI) which are the amount of milisieverts (unit of radiation) received by a person at a distance of 1 m from the package. Each consignment is labelled with the number of TIs and this determines the category (I - 0 TI, II - 0.1 to 1 TI, III - more than 1 TI). If a large number of packages with low radiation is placed next to each other, the effects add up and they can be more dangerous than a single package of a higher category. Hence the requirement to maintain a specific distance between two radioactive packages so that their intensity can be considered independently. Note: We would kindly ask anyone who comes across this question in their official exam to let us know as the current correct option has not been verified.",

To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling “hot” brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off.

External clues that may be directly visible to the pilot include the following: a) strong, gusty surface winds, especially where the aerodrome is located near hills or where there are comparatively large buildings near the runway, indicating the possibility of local wind shear and turbulence; b) lenticular cloud (smooth lens-shaped altocumulus) indicating the presence of standing waves, usually downwind from a mountain; c) virga, i.e. precipitation falling from the base of a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground (especially under convective cloud) because downdrafts may still exist and reach the ground even though the precipitation itself has evaporated; d) roll cloud girding the base of a thunderstorm and advancing ahead of the rain belt, indicating the presence of a gust front (see 3.5.10); e) areas of dust raised by wind, particularly when in the form of a ring below convective clouds, indicating the presence of a downburst (see 5.1.2 and Figure 3-16); f) wind socks responding to different winds; g) smoke plumes sheared, with upper and lower sections moving in different directions; and h) thunderstorms, which should always be assumed to have the capability of producing hazardous wind shear.",

TYPES OF EMERGENCY LANDINGS The different types of emergency landings are defined as follows: Forced landing—an immediate landing, on or off an airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further flight. A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, gradually developing engine trouble, darkness approaching faster than anticipated (when the pilot does not have night flying experience). Ditching—a forced or precautionary landing on water. Of course, all the options in this question are valid considerations. Weather, as described above, may make it impossible to land at all nearby aerodromes, perhaps. The landing surface nearby may be a dry, flat field or perhaps a disused aerodrome, making an off-airport landing safer, however, if it is a built up city, more chance of the pilot trying to continue out of that area. Nature of the emergency is self-explanatory. A fuel problem, increasing engine trouble, etc. does not require the aircraft to be on the ground immediately, whereas an uncontrollable fire does. If an aircraft is close to a suitable aerodrome, the choice will likely be made to land there, even if that means carrying some technical issues further. If many minutes or hours flight away from one, an off-airport landing may be required.",

The incorrect options may also be slightly different due to incomplete feedback. Any further feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank you! With the box being 0.6 m high and the cargo compartment being 1.2 m high, the top of the box of radioactive materials will be only 0.6 m from the top of the cargo compartment, which will certainly bring it within 1 m of the passenger compartment (a floor is unlikely to be more than 0.4 m deep). We think that the annex that we don't have yet will clear up any confusion about floor depth. This is therefore the reason the goods cannot be transported in this location, they are going to be too close to the passenger compartment.

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires can’t break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

You would not wait until late in the landing roll to engage reversers. 'Descend below the glide slope and touch down as close to the landing threshold as possible.' --> INCORRECT. Never descend below the glide slope in an attempt to mitigate for a contaminated runway. Doing so would risk landing short of the runway or with insufficient airspeed. 'Use reverse thrust when the speed is high and change to wheel braking when the speed reduces.' --> INCORRECT. Using reverse thrust at high speed is perfect but this answer states 'change to wheel braking'. Reverse thrust should be used in conjunction with wheel braking in these conditions. 'Avoid floating and apply more wheel braking earlier as their effect is better early in the landing roll.' --> CORRECT. According to the given information, the braking action is reported as GOOD / MEDIUM / MEDIUM. The pilot needs to maximise the GOOD braking available in the 1st third of the runway. Perform an early and firm touchdown. Early as runway behind you is no use, firm to ensure that the wheels break through any surface contamination and make contact with the runway. Decelerate as much as you can as soon as you can: aerodynamic drag and reverse thrust are most effective at high speed.",

Type I fluid is the least effective and it is used mostly for de-icing (for washing the aircraft, mixed with hot water). It provides very limited protection for about 5 minutes. It is used only to clean the aircraft when further icing is not expected or as the first step of a two-step procedure. Type II and IV are used interchangeably for anti-icing, either diluted or not. They are used in the second step of a two-step procedure Type III is used in the same way as type II and IV, the only difference is that it is designed for slower regional aircraft. No anti-icing protection is effective indefinitely - anti-icing fluids will slowly run down along the curved wing’s surface. Therefore, there is a time limit during which the anti-icing protection can be considered reliable. Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature).",

These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplane’s glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraft’s lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or ‘popping’, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

(Source: ICAO Doc 9640 ‘Manual of Aircraft Ground De-icing/Anti-icing Operations’; CAT. OP. MPA.250 ‘Ice and other contaminants — ground procedures’) CAT. OP. MPA.250 Ice and other contaminants — ground procedures (a) The operator shall establish procedures to be followed when ground de-icing and anti-icing and related inspections of the aircraft are necessary to allow the safe operation of the aircraft. (b) The commander shall only commence take-off if the aircraft is clear of any deposit that might adversely affect the performance or controllability of the aircraft, except as permitted under (a) and in accordance with the AFM. Some of the many effects of icing are: - Aerodynamic: Lift can be reduced by as much as 30% and drag increased by up to 40%. This reduction in lift causes an increase in the aircraft's stall speed, which is particularly bad during and just after take-off. - Weight: Ice adds considerably to the mass of the aeroplane and affects the centre of gravity. - Instruments: Ice forming on pitot tubes, static vents or angle of attack vanes can cause errors in indications and give false attitude, airspeed, angle of attack and engine power information for air data systems. - Windscreen and canopies can become obscured. - Thrust can be reduced by ice building up on propellers or onto the blades and hubs of jet engines. - Contamination on wings and control surfaces can cause a significant change in flight characteristics and controllability, as well as jammed controls and a reduction of the safe flight envelope.",

Engine damage may range from dented compressor blades to vibration and engine failure. Windscreens may be shattered, impeding clear vision of the pilot, or in the worst-case causing decompression. Other parts of the airframe also commonly suffer from damage after a bird-strike, although it normally does not result in any critical failure in flight.

The static pressure in the case is now trapped but the total pressure feeding the capsule operates normally. During the descent, the static air pressure will increase which causes the capsule to expand. This will be shown to the pilot as an increase in speed. Note: SOD works for the altimeter, airspeed indicator and machmeter PUD works for the airspeed indicator and machmeter only More details on the pitot-static system: The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because ram air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it under reads in a climb and over reads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI un-serviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator, the altimeter and the Vertical Speed indicator are affected. The Airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. ANGLE OF ATTACK VANE The angle of attack (AOA) instruments measure the angle between the airspeed vector and a predefined line on a cross-section of the airplane wing. If the Angle of Attack vane becomes blocked, Angle of Attack indications will be affected.",

A Head-Up Display (HUD) is a means of presenting information to the pilot in the line of their external forward vision which projects key flight instrument data onto a small ‘see-through’ screen positioned just in front of the pilot line of sight looking ahead out of the aircraft. It is therefore used for pilot awareness only, and provides no extra information that cannot already be found in the flight deck, but it does reduce workload and increase capacity for more critical stages of flight, where visual reference to the outside world is important, but the pilots also need information from their instruments. When combined with synthetic vision, for example, it can be very useful for showing the pilots the location of the runway, even when they are flying IMC. It will, therefore, not help with fuel efficiency, engine wear, passenger comfort, satellite communications, etc. That leaves us only with the correct option remaining.",
