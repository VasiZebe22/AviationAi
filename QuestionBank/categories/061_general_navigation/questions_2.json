To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of GNAV, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their General Navigation exam.",

Density altitude is not particularly important to GNAV specifically, and calculating it is not part of the GNAV learning objectives, so you should appeal this question if you see it in a GNAV exam. Feedback from one authority shows that has been seen in this exam. Density altitude is a measure of the environmental air density, in comparison to where you would find that same density in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), so you end up with an altitude measurement. A high density altitude means low air density, and a low density altitude means high air density (what you would get at low-level). Density altitude can be calculated in 2 main ways, by flight computer or by mathematical calculation. By flight computer (CRP-5) it is relatively simple, in the \"AIR SPEED\" window, line up the pressure altitude with the OAT, and read off the density altitude in the \"DENSITY ALTITUDE\" window (x1000 ft). In this case, you get just under 9000 ft, but this is not the most accurate measurement in the world. We could show a picture in the annex, but flight computers are each very slightly different, so different answers could easily be found on different computers. By mathematical calculation, you take the pressure altitude, and adjust it for temperature by 120 ft per °C different from ISA. As high temperature is lower density, this means that higher than ISA temperature means a higher density altitude, and lower than ISA temperature means a lower density altitude. ISA temperature at 5500 ft (FL55) is 15 - 2(5.5) = 4°C, so with an OAT of +33°C, we are at ISA +29°C, meaning our density altitude is higher than our pressure altitude. The difference is 120 ft/°C x 29°C = 3480 ft, so the Density altitude is 5500 + 3480 = 8980 ft, closest answer 9000 ft",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 150 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 266º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 274º with 4ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 160 kt. It is normal during flight that the track over the ground is different from the desired trajectory defined during planning. If this is the case, some heading corrections should be made so that we can return to the track. The track you want to fly is the planned track, and the track you actually make over the ground is the track made good. The difference between them is called track error (TE). The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 GS = 160 kts Planned track distance flown = 160 x 15’ = 40 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 NM.

When following a magnetic track of 250°M, its true track is: 250°M + 10°E = 260°T (Variation East - Magnetic Least). And since it drifts by 8° Left, its heading is: 260°T + 8° = 268°T.

A method to assess the wind is to use the drift on different headings, known as multi-drift wind method: Place the centre dot over TAS 180 kt and put true heading 268°T under the True Index. Draw a line down the 8° left drift. Now put the next heading 342°T under the True Index and draw a line down the 8° right drift again. The point where the two drift lines intersect is the end of the wind vector. Rotate the disc until the intersection of the two drift lines is immediately under the centre dot on the 0° drift line. Read off the wind direction below the True Index as 305°T. And the wind speed is the difference between the value under the centre dot (180) and the value under the drift lines intersection (144): 180 kt - 144 kt = 36 kt.

(1) Place the track (316º) under the true index. (2) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the ground speed (144 kt). (3) The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value then the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. (4) Maintaining the central grommet over the GS line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS and make a pencil mark. (5) Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centerline between the grommet and the true index. (6) Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark: 35 kt. (7) Read the true wind direction under the true index: 245º.",

The aircraft descends from cruise altitude 5 500 ft to the traffic pattern altitude 2 000 ft, thus the height difference is 3 500 ft. Therefore, the horizontal distance covered during the descent is: Distance to go (ft) = (3 500 ft x 60) / 3° = 70 000 ft or 70 000 ft / 6 080 = 11.51 NM, rounded 12 NM. The aircraft's average Rate of Descent is 750 ft/min, which means that it loses 750 ft in 1 min. Therefore, the aircraft loses 3 500 ft in: 3 500 ft / 750 ft/min = 4.67 minutes or 4 minutes 40 seconds. Finally, the aircraft to reach downwind from cruise altitude 5 500 ft to the traffic pattern altitude 2 000 ft following a 3° glidepath angle, the descent must be initiated at 12 NM prior to downwind, and with a Rate of Descent of 750 ft/min, it will last for 4 minutes 40 seconds.",

Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is the highest Latitude listed below at which the sun will rise above the horizon and set every day\" is 64º. However, according to feedback, it seems that there is a question where the option “64º” is not available. In such case, we have received feedback which confirms the correct option to be “62º”. At the moment, there might be 2 different versions of this question (yet to be confirmed): When the options available include 62º and 64º, the correct option is 64º. When the options available include 62º and all remaining options are higher or equal to 66.5º. In this case, the correct option is 62º.

            "explanation": "Deviation is called the difference between the direction of magnetic north and that of compass north. The deviation experienced is specific to each aircraft and varies with heading and magnetic latitude. The variation with heading occurs because sometimes the resultant aircraft fields will oppose the Earth's field and sometimes reinforce them. Which heading this occurs on, depends on how the deviating fields are aligned within the aircraft. The variation with magnetic latitude occurs because the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field varies in strength depending where it is detected. At the magnetic equator, all the field is in the horizontal component, at the poles the horizontal component is weak to non-existent. Where the horizontal component is weak, the deviating forces are proportionally stronger and therefore the amount of deviation is greater near the poles and correspondingly less at the magnetic equator.",

            "explanation": "The Earth is roughly spherical. Because of its spin it is slightly fatter at the equator and slightly flattened at the poles, a shape known as an oblate spheroid or an ellipsoid. You might come across the term \"Geoid\". In geodesy, a reference ellipsoid is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid. Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude and elevation are defined. Modern navigation systems, like GPS, ude these reference systems and the most common of these is the World Geodetic System of 1984 or WGS 84, created by the United States military. Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic latitude is the angle that a line drawn perpendicular to the surface through a point on a spheroid makes with the equatorial plane (plumb-line on the ellipsoid) and is other than the geocentric (earth centred) latitude. Despite the fact that, in general navigation, we assume that one degree of latitude along a meridian equals to 60 nm. In fact, using a WGS84 ellipsoid, one degree of latitude has a length of 59.7 nm (110.574 km) at the equator and increases progressively with increasing latitude up to 60.3 nm (111.694 km) at the poles.",

True track (T) Variation (V) Magnetic track (M) 060º 15º E 045º Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (130 kt). (2) Place wind direction (190º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (30 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (060º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (130 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 147 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => 10ºR. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, True Heading = TT + 10ºR = 060º + 10ºR = 070º(T) Convert true heading into Magnetic: Use the mnemonic: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

It is known that \"1' change of latitude along a meridian or the Equator equals to 1 NM\". So, 416 NM along a meridian correspond to: 416' or 6° 56' change of latitude. Since the aircraft flies South, the latitude will decrease and the latitude at point B will be: 48°12’ N - 6° 56' = 41°16’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point B will be: 41°16’ N 004°52’ E. After point B, the aircraft continues East, i.e. 090° along a parallel of latitude, for 200 NM to point C. The distance along a parallel of latitude is given by the formula: Departure (NM) = Change of Longitude(') x Cosine of Latitude. Solving for Change of Longitude('), we get: Change of Longitude(') = Departure (NM) / Cosine of Latitude = 200 NM / Cos 41,27° = 266' or 4.43° or 4° 26'. Since the aircraft flies East, the longitude will increase and the longitude at point C will be: 004°52’E + 4° 26' = 009°18’ N. Thus, the coordinates at point C will be: 41°16’ N 009°18’ E.",

If you cut a sphere at one of its great circles, you'd cut it exactly in half. A great circle has the same circumference, or outer boundary, and the same centre point as its sphere. The geometry of spheres is useful for mapping the Earth and other planets. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but it maintains the general shape. All the meridians on Earth are parts great circles. Meridian and its anti meridian for a great circle. Meridians, including the prime meridian, are the north-south lines we use to help describe exactly where we are on the Earth. All these lines of longitude meet at the poles, cutting the Earth neatly in half. The Equator is another of the Earth's great circles. If you were to cut into the Earth right on its Equator, you'd have two equal halves: the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator is the only east-west line that is a great circle. All other parallels (lines of latitude) get smaller as you get near the poles. Great circles can be found on spheres as big as planets and as small as oranges. If you cut an orange exactly in half, the line you cut is the orange's great circle. And until you eat one or both halves, you have two equal hemispheres of the same orange. Great circles are also useful in planning routes. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere is always a segment of a great circle. Plotting great circles comes in very handy for airplane pilots trying to fly the shortest distance between two points.",

This reduced gravity causes the land around the Equator to bulge outwards by approximately 21 km, while making the land at the poles appear flattened. The Earth is, therefore, an irregularly shaped ellipsoid, which is flattened at the poles and bulges at the Equator. This is slightly squished shape is called geoid.

The aircraft departs at 12:15 and we know that at 12:27 (after 12 minutes), the aircraft has covered 40 NM. Ground speed = (40 ÷ 12) x 60 = 200 kt The off track error of 4 NM (1 NM + 3 NM) is recognized at 12:37. We need to calculate the distance along track and the TKE (Track Angle Error) at this position. Time from A to railroad track (40 NM) ⇒ 12:27 - 12:15 = 12 min Time from railroad track to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12:37 - 12:27 = 10 min Time from A to 4 NM off track position ⇒ 12 min + 10 min = 22 min If the aircraft's ground speed is 200 kt, in 22 minutes, it will cover: (200 kt x 22 min) ÷ 60 = 73 NM Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 73 TKE = 3° (approx.) If we alter our heading by 3.3° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: Distance to go = 80 NM - 73 NM = 7 NM TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 7 TKE = 34° (approx.) So turning 3° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 34° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 3° + 34° = 37º (approx.) would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the right, therefore we must fly 37º to the left. Track = 235º - 37º = 198º The aircraft is 80 NM – 73 NM = 7 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 7 NM in 2 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:37 + 2 min = 12:39",

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 280 kt. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 5ºR drift and a track of 275º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 265º with 5ºR drift. All this means is that, to counteract an expected drift of 5ºR, the aircraft flew a heading of 265º(T). However, after covering a distance of 60 NM, our track error angle is 10º left, meaning our track made good has been 260º (T) Calculating the difference between our heading and the track made good results in 5º to the left (265ºT to 260ºT). The average drift observed from 10:20 UTC to 10:32 UTC amounts to 5º to the left. Note: Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading.",

The poles of this hypothetical earth-magnet do not lie on the earth’s spin axis, this lack of symmetry giving rise to magnetic variation - the angular difference between the True North (TN) and the Magnetic North (MN). Variation is designated west or east depending on whether the magnetic pole lies to the west or to the east of true north: - If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. - If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least COMPASS DEVIATION Magnetic material and electrical circuits surround the flight deck that influence the Earth’s magnetic field and cause the compass needle to deflect away from the local magnetic meridian. This is known as compass deviation and can result in deviation either east or west of magnetic north by an amount, which depends on the aeroplane’s heading and latitude. Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Any deviation can be analysed and resolved into components acting along the aeroplane’s major axes. The causes of the deviation are analysed and corrected for by carrying out a compass swing, although some residual deviation remains, and recording them on a deviation card. To obtain a True Heading from the Compass Heading: Use the acronym C-D-M-V-T, and replace the values you are given in the question: From left to right, magnetic deviation W is subtracted from Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Compass Heading to get Magnetic Heading. From left to right, magnetic variation W is subtracted from Magnetic Heading to get True Heading and magnetic variation E is added to Magnetic Heading to get True Heading: Compass Heading (C) Deviation (D) Magnetic Heading (M) Variation (V) True Heading (T) 004º 001ºW 003º 5ºW 358º",

WCA is of equal amount with the drift, but it has opposite direction. For example, when drift is 4oL, the WCA that must be made is 4oR. At this question, you have to distinguish the pre-flight with the actual data. The pre-flight WCA is 8oL, because the pilot was expecting a drift of 8oR due to the wind. But the actual drift is not 8oR as expected, but it is 2o more to the right, 10o R. Therefore, the actual track of the a/c will be also 2o more to the right in comparison with the planned track.

            "explanation": "In navigation, dead reckoning is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration. Dead reckoning is subject to cumulative errors. Advances in navigational aids that give accurate information on position, in particular satellite navigation using the Global Positioning System, have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, inertial navigation systems, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied. By analogy with their navigational use, the words dead reckoning are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities. Accuracy of DR depends on many factors: 1- Time since last position update. 2- Meteorological accuracy of the forecasted wind. 3- Accuracy of heading and speed (GS) flown. 4- Knowledge of pilots in Navigation.",

In our case, the altitude ½ from FL 290 to MSL is FL145 or 14,500 ft. Air temperature at FL145 in ISA conditions is: 15oC - (2oC x 14,500/1,000) = -14oC, but with average ISA deviation -8oC (air is colder by 8oC), the actual air temperature is: -14oC - 8oC = -22oC. Using the airspeed correction window of your nav computer, find the TAS at 14,500 ft. 1. Align Pressure altitude 14,500 feet with actual air temperature -22oC. 2. Opposite CAS 250 kt (inner disc), read TAS 308 kt (outer disc). Using the wind side of your nav computer find the Groundspeed, with TAS: 308 kt, Track: 210o(T) and W/V at 14,500: 310°(T)/45 kt. Set wind direction to 310º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 308 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 210º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 8ºL drift and a track of 202º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 210º. This occurs at a heading of 218º with 9ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 315 kt.",

If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM.

For this question, the aircraft experiences the 2.4 NM off-track distance between the lake and the track, 11 minutes from the previous waypoint. So, the distance from the previous waypoint until the aircraft flies above the small lake is: Distance = GS x Flight time = 115 kt x 11/60 hr = 21 NM. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which is off-track 2.4 NM after 60 NM, will have a drift angle of 2.4º.

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS decrease. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 264 kt and a TAS of 365 kt, at a higher altitude during the climb, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be lower. Therefore, the option that gives both a CAS less than 264 kt and a TAS less than 365 kt is TAS at 356 kt and CAS at 233 kt.",

The primary source for directions inside a cockpit is the magnetic compass and he will align itself with the Magnetic North Pole and not with the True North Pole, those are not co-located. Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Keep in mind, to determine the drift the reference is heading to track. True Track is 245º with drift 5º R, True Heading is 240º.

Accuracy of DR depends on: Time elapsed since last fix; Accuracy of the wind velocity used; Accuracy of headings and airspeeds; Skill and knowledge of the pilot. Reasons for why we continue to teach Dead Reckoning: 1. Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.

            "explanation": "There are multiple methods available to address this question, and the choice among them depends on personal preference. Method 1: The Height difference is: 18 000 ft - 3 000 ft = 15 000 ft The Groundspeed is: TAS + Tailwind component = 130 kt + 30 kt = 160 kt 25 NM / 160 kt = 0.15625 hours 0.15625 hours × 60 minutes/hour ≈ 9.4 minutes 15 000 ft / 9.4 minutes ≈ 1 600 ft/min Method 2: The following formula can be used: Height difference (ft) = Glidepath Angle(o) x Covered Distance (ft) / 60. The Height difference is: 18 000 ft - 3 000 ft = 15 000 ft. So, solving for Glidepath Angle, we get: Glidepath Angle(o) = (Height difference (ft) x 60) / Covered Distance (ft) = 15 000 ft x 60 / (25 x 6080 ) ft = 5.9o. The Groundspeed is: TAS + Tailwind component = 130 kt + 30 kt = 160 kt. Thus, ROD = (Glide Angle/60) x (Groundspeed/60) x 6080 = (5.9/60) x (160/60) x 6080 = 1 594 ft/min, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 3: For a 3o glideslope angle only, the following formula states: ROD = 5 x GS = 5 x 160 = 800 fpm. Thus, for a 5.9o glideslope angle, the ROD will be: 800 fpm x 5.9o / 3o = 1 573 fpm, which is very close to 1 600 ft/min. Method 4 (using your Flight/Nav computer): Set the glide path angle 5.9º(59) over 60. Read out the ROD 1 600 ft/min (16) approximately over the GS 160 kt (16).",

Consequently, utilizing interpolation, we deduce: With an 8 000 ft increase in pressure altitude, wind direction decreases by 10°. With a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind direction decreases by x°. Calculating: x = (10° x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 8.75° ⇒ wind direction at FL170: 310° - 8.75° = 301.25°. Similarly, For an 8000 ft pressure altitude increase, wind velocity increases by 15 kt. For a 7000 ft pressure altitude rise, wind velocity increases by y kt. Computing: y = (15 kt x 7000 ft)/8000 ft = 13.125 kt ⇒ wind velocity at FL170: 5 kt + 13.125 kt = 18.125 kt. Consequently, the wind parameters at FL170 are: 301.25°/18.125 kt.

To find the Change of Latitude: When the parallels of latitude are in different hemispheres - Add. When the parallels of latitude are in the same hemisphere - Subtract.

To calculate TAS, we can use the AIR SPEED window of our flight computer (we have used a CRP-5), and line up 7 000 ft against our OAT of +4ºC. Then on the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 160 kt and read off the TAS of 179 kt on the outer scale. To calculate groundspeed, we just add 12 kt to the TAS for our wind component. GS = 179 + 12 = 191 kt. We have our heading and track, but they are in Magnetic. We will keep them in Magnetic for now, and remember to apply the variation to our calculated wind velocity at the end (it reduces the number of calculations slightly this way). The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (low speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (156º) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (179 kt) under the central point Note the drift to the track (TRK = 150º, so drift = 6º Left) and place a dot where that drift line meets the groundspeed (191 kt). (we have shown a line for better viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre, and place the central dot over the zero point near the bottom of the slider. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top and the wind speed as the value under the dot that you added. Our magnetic wind velocity is 275º(M)/23 kt. (Mag. var. 8ºE) Using the phrase, \"Variation East, Magnetic Least\", the true wind direction is 8º greater. True wind velocity = 283º(T)/23 kt",

In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 10 TKE = 18º The result is greater than 15º and therefore inaccurate. Trigonometry: tan α = 3 NM / 10 NM α = tan-1 (3/10) ≈ 17º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 17° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 5° + 17° = 22º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the left; therefore we must fly 22º to the right.",

(2) Place wind direction (020º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (60 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (070º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (483 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 442 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => approx. 6ºL. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, heading = TT - 6ºL = 070º - 6ºL = 064º Determine the magnetic heading: Variation West, Magnetic Best.

It also refers to the plane of this path and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent orbit of the Sun around the Earth. The axis of rotation of the Earth is inclined to this orbital path at an angle of about 66.5o, which means that the angle between the plane of ecliptic and the Earth’s equator is 23.5o. When we are at the Equator, the daylight does not vary significantly over the year, whereas if we are near the poles, the difference between summer and winter is very dramatic. When looking at total sunlight received, the poles generally have lower sunlight, because even in their summer, there is much lower land area relative to the equator. The tilt of the Earth of the Earth’s axis also means that in extreme northern and southern latitudes, there will be times of the year in winter when the Sun does not rise and times in summer when it does not set. The time of sunrise and sunset changes very little day by day except at high latitudes. The time of sunrise and sunset varies with latitude and time of year higher latitudes experience longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter. The reason for the variation of the duration of daylight throughout the year is the inclination of the Earth’s axis of rotation to the ecliptic. Therefore, Cambridge, which has a relatively high latitude (52oN) will have more hours of daylight on the 1st July and fewer hours of daylight on the 1st January.",

The aircraft descends from cruise altitude 4500ft to the traffic pattern altitude 1500 ft, thus the height difference is 3000 ft. Therefore, the horizontal distance covered during the descent is: Distance to go (ft) = (3000 ft x 60) / 3o = 60,000 ft or 60,000ft / 6,080 = 9.86 NM, rounded 10 NM. The aircraft's average Rate of Descent is 850 ft/min, which means that it loses 850 ft in 1 min. Therefore, the aircraft loses 3000 ft in: 3000ft / 850 ft/min = 3.5 minutes or 3 minutes 30 seconds. Finally, the aircraft to reach downwind from cruise altitude 4500 ft to the traffic pattern altitude 1500ft following a 3° glidepath angle, the descent must be initiated at 10 NM prior to downwind, and with a Rate of Descent of 850 ft/min, it will last for 3 minutes 30 seconds.",

A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During climb with a constant CAS, both TAS and Mach speed increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the climb the instruments' cross-check shows TAS at 336 kt and Mach speed 0.55, at FL280 both TAS and Mach speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and Mach speed higher than 336 kt and 0.55 correspondingly, is TAS 357 kt and Mach 0.59.",

So its actual Groundspeed is: GS = Distance / Time = 37 NM / (14/60) = 158 kt. Thus, it covers the distance of 50 NM from the aerodrome to the turning point in: Time = Distance / GS = 50 NM / 158 = 0.31 hr or 19 min. Therefore, the aircraft's Estimated Time of Arrival at the turning point will be: 22:14 + 19 min = 22:33. But the aircraft is not above overhead the aerodrome as planned, but 5 NM right off it, because the wind is not as forecast. Using your Navigation/Flight computer follow the steps below: Firstly, find the Track Error Angle, which is also the degrees to parallel: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance gone 37 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to parallel 8.1o (81) on the outer scale. Secondly, find the degrees to intercept at the next turning point: Place the distance off track 5 NM (50) over the distance to go 50 NM and read over the 60 marker the degrees to get back to track at the turning point 6o (60) on the outer scale. Thus, the total correction to the heading must be: 8.1o + 6o = 14.1o. And since the aircraft is off track to the right, the total correction to the heading must be to the left. Therefore, the heading to intercept the turning point must be: 175o - 14.1o = 160.9o, which is close to 161o.",

(3) Determine the drift: Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft and its heading. Keep in mind, to determine the drift the reference is heading to track. In this case, Heading is 077º and the Track is 086º, therefore we have 9º right drift. (4) Place a mark (in this case, the end of the line) at the intersection of the arc representing your GS (288 kt) and the drift (9ºR). (5) Rotate the disk (azimuth) until the mark is located on the centreline below TAS. (6) Read wind speed (difference between the centre and mark on the centreline) and direction (under the true index): 335º/45 kt",

In these cases, the TAS and W/V to use on the Flight/Nav computer is as folllows: For Climb problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. For Descent problems - the TAS and W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. 1. The aircaft descends from FL200 to 2 000 ft. The 1/2 of the cruising altitude is at: [1/2 x (20 000 - 2 000)] ft + 2000 ft= 11 000 ft. 2. Air temperature at FL110 in ISA conditions is: 15oC - (2oC x 11 000/1,000) = -7oC, but with average ISA deviation -7oC (air is colder by 7oC), the actual air temperature is: -7oC - 7oC = -14oC. 3. Using the airspeed correction window of your nav computer, find the TAS at 11 000 ft. 1. Align Pressure altitude 11 000 feet with actual air temperature -14oC. 2. Opposite CAS 200 kt (inner disc), read TAS 234 kt (outer disc). 4. The Groundspeed can be found using your flight/nav computer with TAS 234 kt and the W/V at FL110: 060°(T)/45 kt (after interpolating the wind conditions at 2 000 ft and at 20 000 ft): Set wind direction to 060º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 234 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 165º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 10ºR drift and a track of 175º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 165º. This occurs at a heading of 155º with 11ºR drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 242 kt.",

This solution has a few parts to it, so we will take you through the planning and then the actual calculations. Working backwards, we have a heading and TAS from the OFP, so need the actual track (Track Made Good, TMG) and groundspeed (GS) of the aircraft from Fruges windfarm to Wimereux. The ATA of 14:43 allows us to calculate the GS, and the position 1 NM right of Wimereux allows us to calculate the TMG. Groundspeed The ATA (Actual Time of Arrival) abeam Wimereux was 14:43, making the leg 12 minutes long from the ATA at the previous waypoint (14:31). The distance of the leg is 23 NM. 12 minutes long is 12/60 = 0.2 hours. Groundspeed (kt) = Ground Distance (NM) / time (hours) Groundspeed = 23 NM / 0.2 = 115 kt Track Made Good (TMG) 1 NM off track over a 23 NM leg distance, we can use the 1 in 60 rule to calculate the angle of drift off the expect track. 1 x (60/23) = 2.6° right of planned track. This gives a true track for that leg of 310° + 2.6° = 312.6°, but for further calculation we will just use TMG = 313° Wind Calculation (we have used the CRP-5 and wind-down method) With your flight computer on the wind side, set the true heading to 300° and the centre point over the TAS of 110 kt. Then make a mark where the line of 13° right drift (corresponding to the TMG of 313°) and the Groundspeed of 115 kt meet. Take this point and place it directly underneath the centre dot, then you may take the centre dot to the top of the vertical grid section and read off the wind direction and strength. All directions were in \"true\" so no variation required. The wind component is closest to 205°(T)/25 kt.",

Then, find the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 210 kt on the inner scale. Finally, read the True Airspeed (TAS) on the outer scale opposite the CAS of 210 kt on the inner scale. In this case, the True Airspeed (TAS) is 275 kt. Determining Heading and G/S with the flight computer: Move the slide until the center dot falls on the arc marked i.e. 275 (you can choose any arc you like as this will not affect the final result, we choose the TAS). Next, rotate the window disc to align the True Wind Direction (050°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. Draw a downward line starting from the ring along the centerline, with a length equal to the Wind Velocity (40 kt). Then, rotate the window disc to align the True Track (270°) with the \"TRUE INDEX\" on the fixed scale. The end of the line should be approximately 5° to the Left of the centerline, which corresponds to a 5° Left (Port) Drift Angle. Therefore, WCA is 5ºR. To determine the Ground Speed, find the speed arc that passes under the end of the line drawn. In this case, the Ground Speed is 305 kt. Wind Correction Angle is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track. In this case, the WCA is 5º R (drift is 5ºL), the true heading = 270º + 5º = 275º (T). Let's determine the Magnetic Heading: True heading (T) Variation (V) Magnetic heading (M) Deviation (D) Compass heading (C) 275º 7ºE 268º Variation West, Magnetic Best. Variation East, Magnetic Least. Assuming a Ground Speed of 305 kt, which is equivalent to 305/60 NM/min, the time required to travel a distance of 300 NM can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance/Ground Speed In this case, the time would be (300 x 60) / 305 min = 59 min Given that the Time of Departure is 10:15 UTC and the estimated flight time is 59 min, the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) can be calculated as 10:15 UTC + 00:59 = 11:14 UTC.",

Therefore, we need to calculate the True Heading. To calculate the True Heading, both the Track and the Wind Direction must be referenced to the same North (either True or Magnetic). We will be converting the Track from Magnetic to True. By considering the provided magnetic variation: Variation = 5º W ⇒ Variation West, Magnetic Best ⇒ True Track = Magnetic Track - 005º = 007º - 005º = 002º. Given that True Track = 002º, TAS = 445 kt, and W/V: 050º/40 kt, we can use a flight computer to determine the true heading: Rotate the window disc until the True Wind Direction (050º) aligns below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Commencing from the center dot, draw an upward line along the centerline, with a length equivalent to the Wind Velocity (40 kt) - if you use TAS as reference, mark wind speed up from 445 kt, 485 kt. Rotate the window disc until the True Track (002º) falls below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Shift the slide until the center dot aligns with the arc corresponding to the True Airspeed (445 kt). Wind correction angle reads between centre line and Wind speed Mark => 4°R. 4ºR WCA means that the aircraft is experiencing a 4ºL drift. Therefore, Heading = Track + drift = 002°+ 004°= 006° Finally, applying the relationship above, we obtain: True Bearing from the aircraft to the Locator PY (at 1 003 UTC) = 266º + 006º = 272º.",

Thus, a distance of 500 NM along a meridian corresponds to 500' change of latitude or 8° 20'. Therefore, as it flies south on the northern hemisphere, its latitude will decrease, provided that it does not cross the Equator. Its new latitude at B point, after 500 NM south off A point, will be: 26°06'N - 8° 20' = 17°46'N. After B point, the aircraft continues eastwards (i.e. along the same parallel of latitude) for 500 NM along the 17°46'N parallel of latitude. The distance along a parallel of latitude is called \"Departure\" and is given by the formula: Departure(NM) = Change of Longitude(min) x cos Lat. Solving for Change of Longitude we get: Change of Longitude(min) = Departure(NM) / cos Lat = 500 NM / cos 17°46' = 525 or 8° 45'. Therefore, its new longitude, after 500 NM east off B point, will be: 004°11' + 8° 45' = 012°56' E. Finally, C position's coordinates will be: 17°46'N 012°56' E.",

CRP-5 flight computer: Adjust the window disc to position the True Heading (007º) below the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. Identify the Drift Angle by observing that the Drift Angle on the fixed scale opposite the True Track (022º) on the window disc is 15º right. Locate the point on the slide where the 15º Right Drift Angle intersects the arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (160 kt) and mark it with a pencil. Rotate the window disc until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline, positioning it BELOW the center dot. Calculate the Wind Velocity by measuring the length of the wind vector from the center dot to the pencil mark. Note that the center dot aligns with the arc for 165, while the pencil mark is on the arc for 122, resulting in a Wind Velocity of 43 kt (165-122=43). Determine the Wind Direction by identifying the value on the window disc aligned with the TRUE HEADING index on the fixed scale. In this case, the value is 291º.",

The question provides a lot of data, but to find the True Airspeed (TAS), we only need the Ground Speed (GS) and the wind component. With a headwind, the TAS is higher than the GS because the wind is slowing you down. Therefore, you add the headwind component to the GS. With a tailwind, the TAS is lower than the GS because the wind is pushing you faster. Therefore, you subtract the tailwind component from the GS. Here's the formula to calculate TAS: TAS = GS ± Headwind/Tailwind Component - Use the plus sign if it’s a headwind (wind blowing against the direction of travel). - Use the minus sign if it’s a tailwind (wind blowing in the same direction as travel). Given: Ground Speed (GS) = 485 knots Headwind Component = 25 knots Since it's a headwind, you add the headwind component to the ground speed to find the TAS. TAS = GS + Headwind Component TAS = 485 kt + 25 kt TAS = 510 kt",

The Flight Time is given by the formula: Time = Distance / Groundspeed = 753.8 NM / 150 kt = 5.02 hrs. Therefore, the ETA at point A is approximately: 08:25 + 5 hrs = 13:25.",

In this scenario, the halfway down the descent point is between FL310 and FL180 is at FL245. We need to perform interpolation between the wind data at FL250 and FL180 to estimate the values at FL245. The interpolated values are approximately 191º/39 kt. While none of the available options precisely match these interpolated values, the most suitable choice from the provided answers would be 205º/40 kt for wind speed. To break down the interpolation: Interpolation: FL250: 190/40 FL180: 200/30 During a 7 000 ft descent (from 25 000 ft to 18 000 ft), the wind direction veered by 10º. Therefore, in a 500 ft interval, the wind would change by approximately 1º (191º). Similarly, during the same 7 000 ft descent, the wind speed decreased by 10 kt. Hence, in a 500 ft interval, the wind speed would decrease by roughly 1 kt (39 kt). Consequently, the most appropriate wind estimate, given these considerations, would be 205º/40 kt.",

Descent problems is the W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. 1. The aircaft climbs from 4 000 ft to 8 000 ft. The 2/3 of the cruising altitude is at: [2/3 x (8 000 - 4 000)] ft + 4 000 ft= 6 667 ft. 2. With the data given, we cannot find the W/V at 4 000 ft and interpolate with the W/V at 8 000 ft for the 2/3 of the cruising altitude, but we can find through the flight/nav computer, the GS at 8 000 ft and interpolate with the GS given at 4 000 ft for the 2/3: Set wind direction to 200º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index at the top. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 240 kt. Mark the wind velocity 45 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 250º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 259º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 250º. This occurs at a heading of 241º with 8ºR drift. The groundspeed at 8 000 ft for this track is approximately 208 kt. 3. After interpolation, the GS at 2/3 of the cruising altitude (6 667 ft) is: 212 kt. 4. The time to climb from 4 000 ft to 8 000 ft is: Height difference / ROC = (8 000 ft - 4 000 ft) / 1 500 fpm = 2.67 min. 5. The Ground distance covered during the climb is: GS x Time = 212 kt x 2.67/60 hr = 9.434 NM.(9.4 is the closest)",

Creation of a Dead Reckoning encourages the pilot to consider the safest and most economical flightpath, potential threats and eventual consequences of navigational errors. 2. It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3. It is fail-safe mean of navigation. DR does not rely on any navigational aid, it is therefore a valuable contingency navigation method, even if the the plan is to fly with.

Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt. Mark the wind velocity 15 kt down from the centre point. Initially, set the True Track to 090º under the \"TRUE HEADING\" index. Note that this heading would result in 4ºL drift and a track of 086º. Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 090º. This occurs at a heading of 094º with 5ºL drift. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 130 kt. GS = 130 kts Planned track distance flown = 130 x 15 min = 32.5 NM => This distance is based on the forecast wind, but the exercise states that the aircraft is 2.5 ahead of the dead reckoning position, actual position = 32.5 + 2.5 = 35 NM. Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 35 TKE = 5° If we alter our heading by 5° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination.

Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

At a height the air density reduces and therefore the same dynamic pressure reflects a higher TAS. The same thing would happen, if the air was warmer than standard. Conversely, at a lower height or in colder air than standard, the same dynamic presssure reflects a lower TAS. This means that at height we have two airspeeds, the CAS based on dynamic pressure and the higher TAS than CAS through the air. As an aircraft descends from one altitude to one other lower with constant CAS, but higher to Sea Level, the TAS will be in both cases higher than the CAS, but the difference between them increases as altitude increases and decreases as altitude decreases, until they become equal at Sea Level in ISA conditions. For this question, the TAS will be always higher than CAS during the descent (thus, 119 kt is excluded), but a few minutes later, after FL080, the TAS will be lower than 135 kt, 131 kt.",

Calculate the TKE (Track Angle Error) to give us the heading correction in order to parallel our intended track: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance along track TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 60 TKE = 4° If we alter our heading by 4° (towards the original track) we will parallel our original track. In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (4 × 60) ÷ 20 TKE = 12º So turning 4° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 4° + 12° = 16º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The deviation was to the left, therefore we must fly 16º to the right. Track = 235º + 16º = 251º The aircraft 80 NM – 60 NM = 20 NM away from the destination. At 200 kt, it will cover 20 NM in 6 minutes. The destination will be reached at 12:33 + 6 min = 12:39",

It is an acceptable and approved mean of navigation. Dead Reckoning can be used to navigate under Visual Flight Rules without having to rely on a radio or other navigational aids. 3.

Magnetic Direction, have as reference the Magnetic North Pole and is assigned an angular value of 000º M or 360º M. Variation is the angle between the True and Magnetic North and is assigned in degrees East or West of the True North. If the Magnetic North is west of the True North, westerly variation, the magnetic direction will have a higher angular value than the true direction. If the Magnetic North is east of the True North, easterly variation, the magnetic direction will have a lower angular value than the true direction. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least The utility of a magnetic compass on the aircraft will depend on the accuracy of its response to the magnetic field of the earth. The metallic structure of the airplane, its engine and equipment can affect the accuracy of the compass, an effect called the compass deviation. Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication). Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.

In this case, Heading is 020º and the Track is 010º, therefore we have 10º left drift. Ground Speed = (57 NM / 15 min) x 60 min = 228 kt Determining winds with the flight computer: 1. Set True Heading (020ºM) under \"True Index\" 2. Place centre dot over TAS (260 kts) 3. Mark the point where drift (10ºL) and GS (228 kt) meet. 4. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. 5. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (68º M) 6. Count down from TAS to obtain wind speed (260 - 206 = 54 kt) W/V = 068º M / 54 kt => The question asks for W/V in (ºT), therefore we must apply the variation: Magnetic versus True Use this mnemonic to remember that with variation west, the magnetic direction is going to be \"best\" or greater than true. Variation is added to true to arrive at magnetic, or subtracted from magnetic to get true. 068ºM - 20ºW = 048ºT W/V = 048ºT / 54 kt",

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 TE = (4/30) x 60 = 8º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 CA = (4 / (150 - 30)) x 60 = 2º With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 8º + 2º = 10º L The aircraft is right off-track, the aircraft must fly left to regain track.",

Compass deviation is defined by the number of degrees by which unwanted magnetic fields deflect the compass from magnetic north indication (desired indication).

When transforming True Heading (TH) into Magnetic Heading (MH) and vice versa, we consider magnetic variation. Variation represents the angle between True North and Magnetic North, expressed in degrees East or West of True North. To convert Magnetic Heading to Compass Heading (CH), we consider deviation. Remember the mnemonic \"West is Best, East is Least\". Westerly variation increases TH (+), whereas easterly variation reduces it (-). Furthermore, negative values for variation or deviation signify westerly, whereas positive values signify easterly. Variation (-) West – Magnetic Best Variation (+) East – Magnetic Least Deviation (-) West – Compass Best Deviation (+) East – Compass Least Drift or drift angle, is the angular difference between the track of the aircraft across and it's heading. Always remember that the drift angle is always measured with reference to the heading. The heading is the direction in witch the the aircraft’s nose is pointing for.",

If you are only 20 NM along track, every one degree of drift angle relates to one third of a NM. If so, 2 NM off-track must equate to a 6º drift angle and 3 NM off-track must equate to a 9º drift angle. Applying the 1:60 rule, an aircraft which is off-track 3 NM after 60 NM, will have a drift angle of 3º. Thus, after 30.6 NM, the aircraft will have a drift angle of: 3º x 60/30.6 = 6º (rounded).",

The pilot expects the aircraft to be tracking the 320º radial, but finds out that the aircraft has actually tracked 323º from the VOR. This is 3º to the right, and that means that this could be due to a lesser crosswind component than forecast, given the wind from the right and from behind. It could also be due to a different headwind/tailwind component, but this can be discounted by calculating the distance versus the expected distance travelled. The pilot expects to fly at 158 kt groundspeed with the forecast wind, and has flown for 30 minutes outbound from KOK VOR. Therefore the pilot expects to be at 158/60 x 30 = 79 nm from the DME, and this is almost exactly correct. Therefore, the tailwind component has been the same. This means that the lesser crosswind is certainly what has caused the drift off track.",

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is the part that is detected by the compass needle in order to determine Magnetic North. Therefore, it is accurate enough to say that variation is the angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the true north direction. At a specific location, the value of magnetic variation varies slowly over time. In fact, the magnetic pole is constantly moving, causing the values at all locations to increase or decrease. This periodic change is also reflected in the slow movement of the magnetic poles monitored through the various ground and satellite-based stations/instruments. The IRS of the aircraft also contains a variation program. It is supplied to the IRS true North to obtain a magnetic heading, which is ultimately fed to the FMS. The IRS is also normally recalibrated from time to time so that it can maintain the variation accurately enough. Lately, the magnetic pole location is changing more rapidly, approximately at a rate of 30 to 40 miles per year, moving towards Siberia. The need to continuously monitor and update the magnetic variation charts is, therefore, more crucial than ever. LO 061.01.03.01.05: Explain changes of variation with time and position.",

ISA temperature at 18 000 ft = 15 - 2 x 18 = -21ºC Actual temperature = ISA +10ºC OAT at 18 000 ft = -11ºC Using the navigation computer, convert 230 kt CAS to TAS: 1) Align the pressure altitude of 18 000 ft window with the OAT of -11ºC; 2) Once the wheel is aligned, find the CAS of 230 kt on the inner most scale. Read the corresponding TAS of approx. 309 kt on the outer scale. Note that since the result is just over 300 kt, we should apply a compressibility correction using the COMP CORR window, however the correctio will be so minute that we are unable to see it (0.009 of a division).",

So, if you have travelled for 30 NM the error will be half NM per degree of track error or, if you have travelled for 20 NM, one third NM per degree of track error. If the track error is larger, the error will be proportionally larger, so 60 NM along track a 2o track error will place you 2 NM off track, or 1 NM off track after 30 NM. The rule can be used to determine the track error angle,when the displacement is known, the displacement, when the track is known and correction to intercept, when displacement is known. The correction that must be made to intercept the DET VOR is given by the following formula, which is based on the 1:60 rule: (Distance off track / Miles to go) = (Degrees to intrercept / 60). Solving for Degrees to intercept we get: Degrees to intercept = (Distance off track x 60) / Miles to go = (2.5 NM x 60) / (27 NM - 15 NM) = 12.5o. Thus, since the aircraft is off-track to the left, the correction that must be made to arrive at DET VOR must be to the right, and its magnetic heading must be: Planned Magnetic Heading from M20 junction to DET VOR + Degrees to intercept = 283o (M) + 12.5o = 295.5o, which is very close to 296o.",

In order to re-join the original track, we must calculate the track correction for the distance to go: In the attachment we can find the distance from A to B, which is 50 NM. Therefore, the distance to go is 15 NM (50 NM - 35 NM). TKE = (distance off track × 60) ÷ distance to go TKE = (3 × 60) ÷ 15 TKE = 12º So turning 5° will parallel our track, and turning an extra 12° on top of that will direct us to the final destination. Therefore, 5° + 12° = 17º would be the total alteration required (to re-join the original track). The track is 090º and the track error was to the North, therefore, to reach B, the pilot needs to turn right: 095º + 17º = 112º",

Effects of Cold Temperature on Baro-vertical Navigation (VNAV) Vertical Guidance Non-standard temperatures can result in a change to effective vertical paths and actual descent rates when using aircraft baro-VNAV equipment for vertical guidance on final approach segments. A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate. Pilots should consider potential consequences of these effects on approach minima, power settings, sight picture, visual cues, etc., especially for high-altitude or terrain-challenged locations and during low-visibility conditions.",

            "explanation": "We are required to determine the True bearing to the NDB. Typically, an RMI shows Magnetic Heading and Bearings. However, based on the information provided in the question (RMI Deviation), we can infer that the RMI readings will be relative to Compass North. Given that the ADF is tuned to an NDB, the ADF needle on the RMI works as follows: The Tip of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing to the NDB (300°). The Tail of the ADF needle indicates the Compass bearing from the NDB (120°). In this case, we assume that the RMI is subjected to electromagnetic interference and therefore, deviation is applied: -2ºW (westerly deviation) ⇒ Compass North is 2° West of Magnetic North. Let’s start by converting compass heading to magnetic heading: Deviation west, compass best; Deviation east, compass least Magnetic Bearing to the NDB = Compass Bearing to the NDB - 002° = 300° - 002° = 298° Since the question asks for true bearing, we need to correct for magnetic variation: Variation west, magnetic best; Variation east, magnetic least. Remember that for NDB/ADF bearings the bearings are taken at the aircraft, therefore the magnetic variation applicable at the aircraft's position is to be used: Variation at the DR position = 22° West ⇒ Magnetic North is 22° West of True North True Bearing to the NDB = Magnetic Bearing to the NDB - 022° = 298° - 022° = 276°",

Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points. Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME. Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points. Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North. The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082°T. Variation is 001°W, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082°T+ 1° = 083° M(Variation West, Magnetic Best). Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is \"1 INCH = 15 NM\", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM. Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.",

With this information, we are able to determine the actual GS: 75 NM ÷ 0.677 h = 110.8 kt Now that we know the actual GS (110.8 kt), we can calculate the time it will take to cover 250 NM: 250 NM ÷ 110.8 kt = 2.26 h (2 h 15 min) The aircraft departs A at 09:00 UTC, therefore the revised ETA at destination equals: 09:00 UTC + 2 h 15 min = 11:15 UTC",

            "explanation": "Consider this exercise as a simple crosswind exercise, the difference is that the wind information is not directly given. First we need to find out the wind information, using the flight computer: 1. Course/track aligns with the TRUE HEADING on the wind side of the flight computer (090º). Central grommet on the ground speed (290º). 2. The Course/Track and heading difference will determine the Wind Correction Angle. Heading with lower angular value than the Course, WCA mark left of the center line. Heading with higher angular value than the Course, WCA mark right of the center line. 3. Maintaining the central grommet over the G/S line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS (250 kt) and make a pencil mark (10ºL). 4. Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centreline between the grommet and the true index. 5. Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark (60 kt). 6. Read the true wind direction under the true index (315º). Now that we've determined the wind speed and angle, we can apply the formula: Crosswind Component (XWIND) = Wind Speed × sin (Wind Angle) Given a heading of 080º and a wind angle of 315º, the difference is 235º. Crosswind Component (XWIND) = 60 × sin (235º) = −49.15 kt Since the heading is 080º and the tracking is 090º, it's evident that the wind is from the left and on the tail, therefore it is blowing the aircraft to the right: 49 kt right. The wind is from the left and on your tail, therefore it is blowing you to the right.",

We can use the \"drift\" value in the wind calculation instead of the track, so there's no need to work out the track here. The wind velocity is calculated on the flight computer's wind side (high speed). We have used the wind down method. Set the Heading (North) under the datum point at the top and the TAS (500 kt) under the central point Place a dot where the relevant drift line (12ºL) meets the groundspeed (550 kt). (we have shown a line from the centre to this point for easier viewing) Rotate the wheel until that dot is straight down from the centre. Read off the wind direction under the \"TRUE HEADING\" datum at the top. The wind speed is the amount of knots the line or dot is below the centre point (500 kt - 380 kt = 120 kt in this case). True wind velocity = 108º(T)/120 kt Closest Answer = 109º/120 kt",

The highest speed of the Earth in its orbit is at perihelion, the lowest at aphelion. Perihelion occurs in early January and Aphelion in early July. These differences in range are not enough to cause the seasons, but these come from the Earth's tilt or, using astronomic terminology, the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the ecliptic (where ecliptic, the name given to the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere). When the northern hemisphre is tilted most towards the Sun, it experiences northern hemisphere summer. When it tilts most away, it is northern hemisphere winter, but southern hemisphere summer.",

Wing Angle (WA): 063º 090º - 063 = 027º Wind Speed: 50 kt TWC = (0.5) x 50 = 25 kt So, the Groundspeed is: GS = TAS + TWC = 465 kt + 25 kt = 490 kt. 2. Flight/Nav computer Place the centre dot over TAS 465 kt. Rotate the disk until wind direction 220o is under the True index. Mark wind velocity 50 kt below the centre dot. Rotate the disc until the track 337o is under the True index. The mark shows a Groundspeed of 490 kt.",

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 Planned track distance flown = 140 x 30’ = 70 NM TE = (7/70) x 60 = 6º The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA.

Thus, its Actual Fuel Flow is: 30 lt / 12 min = 2.5 lt/min. The FL, TAS, Track, Heading and Groundspeed remain unchanged from TORDU to EBROX. So, the Flight time from TORDU via LOTOS to EBROX is: Leg distance / Actual GS = (26 NM + 14 NM) / 185 kt = 0.22 hr or 13 min. And, the fuel required from TORDU via LOTOS to EBROX will be: Actual fuel flow x Flight leg time = 2.5 lt/min x 13 min = 32.5 lt.

Thus, its latitude (53°04'N) remains constant, when it crosses the R360 BUN. Variation is 0o, so R360 coincides with the true meridian 004°50'E, which passes through the BUN VOR. The range between the aircraft crossing R360 BUN and BUN VOR is equal to their the Change of Latitude. So, applying the rule \"Same hemispheres, Subtract\", the Change of Latitude along the true meridian or R360 is: 53o04’N - 51o07’N = 1o 57’ or 117’. We know, also, that \"Along a meridian, 1’ corresponds to 1NM\". Therefore, the range of the aircraft from the BUN VOR when crossing R360 is 117NM.",

Geodetic latitude and longitude is used to define a position on the WGS 84 ellipsoid for aviation charts. Geodetic longitude is defined as \"The angular distance between the prime meridian and another meridian passing through a point on the Earth's surface\" or \"The angle in the equatorial plane between the line a that connects the Earth's centre with the prime meridian and the line b that connects the centre with the meridian on which the point lies\".

(1) Place the track (324º) under the true index. (2) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the ground speed (450 kt). (3) Maintaining the central grommet over the GS line, find the point where WCA crosses the TAS and make a pencil mark. NOTE: The exercise provides the drift, WCA and drift are opposite to each other and of equal magnitude. Drift 8ºR means that a WCA 8ºL must be done to follow the desired track. (4) Rotate the azimuth disk until the pencil mark is on the centerline between the grommet and the true index. (5) Determine the wind velocity by counting the lines between the grommet and the pencil mark: 68 kt (518 kt - 450 kt). (6) Read the magnetic wind direction under the true index: 204º. Note: This exercise is asking us for the magnetic wind direction, but since the track given is already magnetic, we don’t have to apply the variation. E6-B Flight Computer: Divide the Ground Speed and True Airspeed by 2: Ground Speed: 450 kt / 2 = 225 kt True Airspeed: 420 kt / 2 = 210 kt (1) Move the slide until the ring aligns with the arc corresponding to the Ground Speed (225 kt). (2) Rotate the transparent (azimuth) disk to position the Magnetic Track (324º) below the TRUE INDEX. (3) The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is 8º Left. Find where the 8º Left WCA intersects the arc corresponding to the True Airspeed (210 kt) and make a pencil mark. (4) Rotate the transparent (azimuth) disk until the pencil mark aligns with the centerline, above the ring, between the ring and the TRUE INDEX. (5) Determine the Wind Velocity by counting the lines between the ring and the pencil mark.

Thereafter, we are expected to find the new groundspeed required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Lastly, we will convert it back to IAS and determine the reduction. Step-by-step solution: (1) Determine TAS from IAS: First Step (1): Use the “AIR SPEED” window. Align 14 000 ft with -5ºC. Second Step (2): Find IAS 210 kt (inner scale, outer ring) and read the corresponding value of TAS 264 kt (outer scale). (2) Knowing the wind component and TAS, we can determine the ground speed: Wind component: -35 kt TAS: 264 kt Groundspeed = 264 kt – 35 kt = 229 kt (3) Calculate the time it would take to cover 150 NM at 229 kt: Time = Distance ÷ Speed Time = 150 NM ÷ 229 kt Time = 39.3 min (4) However, the aircraft is required to arrive 5 minutes later than planned. Therefore, we need to find the revised time: Revised time = 39.3 min + 5 min = 44.3 min (5) Determine the new groundspeed to meet the delay restriction: Groundspeed = (150 NM / 44.3 min) x 60 min = 203 kt (6) Considering the wind component and the groundspeed, calculate the revised TAS: Revised TAS = 203 kt + 35 kt = 238 kt (7) Determine IAS from TAS: First Step (1): Use the “AIR SPEED” window. Align 14 000 ft with -5ºC. Second Step (2): Find TAS 238 kt (outer scale) and read the corresponding value of IAS 188 kt (inner scale, outer ring). Reduction in IAS = initial IAS – new IAS Reduction in IAS = 210 kt – 188 kt = 22 kt",

Track is lower than heading, meaning it's a left drift (8ºL). Determine W/V (CRP5 method): 1. Set True Heading (090ºT) under \"True Index\" 2. Place centre dot over TAS (460 kts) 3. Mark the point where drift (8ºL) and GS (485 kt) meet. 4. Rotate the wind computer until mark is below TAS. 5. Check wind direction under \"True Index\" (197º) 6.

(2) Find out True Track and Drift using the flight computer: Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (180 kt). Place wind direction (310°) under the true index Mark wind velocity downwards from the centre. It can be done from arbitrary positions, only magnitude is important. When the question provides a track → mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the Heading is known → mark wind velocity downwards from centre. Place your true heading (220°) under the true index. Read the Groundspeed of 184 kt and a drift of 8°L. (3) Calculate True Track using Heading and Drift The drift is the angle difference from the Heading to the Track, so a 8° left drift means that the Track should have a direction 8° less than the Heading. This only applies if they are using the same datum, so both Magnetic, both True, etc. True Track = 220° - 8° = 212°",

On the other hand, putting the AWR into \"mapping\" mode allows the radar to reflect off surface features, which can give quite a good indication of the ground profile nearby. For instance, ground mapping radar can allow pilots to distinguish coastlines quite easily, as well as mountain ranges and sometimes even cities. To establish a fix, the pilots would place the AWR in mapping mode and/or tilt the radar down a lot, then look for echoes on the display that show these features, comparing that with a chart to get an idea of their position. It is certainly a skill, and not one that will be passed through the generations of pilots very well in the modern era, as it is almost useless these days. Note: There are a couple of other options that are close to being correct, whilst none of the others are completely true. Please send us any further exam feedback you have so we can verify this question and correct answer, thanks!",

When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (260º) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (270 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 241 kt; WCA reads between centre line and wind velocity mark => 2ºR. Using Wind Correction Angle (WCA) and Track, determine Heading: Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angular value opposite to the drift angle, and it refers to the heading angle correction in order to keep your aircraft in the desired track: Therefore, heading = TT + 2ºR = 260º + 2ºR = 262º",

Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is the angle difference from the aircraft’s actual track (track made good) to its planned heading. It is of equal amount with the drift, but with different sign. The planned Wind Correction Angle is 6ºL, so the planned drift angle is 6ºR and the planned heading is: 031º(T) - 6ºL = 025º(T). But, during flight the pilot realizes that the actual drift angle is 4o R, instead of 6o R. So, for a planned heading of 025º(T), if the aircraft drifts by 4ºR, its actual track will be: 025º(T) + 4ºR = 029º(T).",

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE: TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 With the flight computer determine the G/S to calculate the planned track distance flown = 123 x 15’ = 31 NM.

If we assume an equal change of wind direction and speed per 1 000 ft, we can say that he wind direction increases by 1.66° / 1 000 ft (30° within 18 000 ft) and 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft (30 kt within 18 000 ft). W/V used for climb problems is the WV at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude. W/V used for descent problems is the WV at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude. The altitude change in the climb is 20 000 - 2 000 = 18 000 ft. 2 / 3 x 18 000 ft = 12 000 ft. 12 000 ft through the climb occurs at 2 000 + 12 000 = 14 000 ft. Therefore, 14 000 ft will be 14 000 - 2 000 ft = 12 000 ft higher than 2 000 ft. Wind direction at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66° / 1 000 ft = 20° higher than wind direction at 2 000 ft. Wind speed at 14 000 ft will be 12 000 ft x 1.66 kt / 1 000 ft = 20 kt higher than wind speed at 2 000 ft. Consequently, at 14 000 ft wind is 280° + 30° = 300° and wind speed is 20 + 20 = 40 kt. CAS = 220 kt “To find TAS, add 2% to the CAS for every 1 000 ft of altitude.” TAS = CAS + 2% CAS x (Altitude) / 1 000 ft = 220 + 2% 220 x 14 000 / 1 000 = 282 kt Determining G/S with the flight computer: (1) Place the centre of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (282 kt). (2) Place wind direction (300º) under the true index. (3) Mark wind velocity (40 kt) upwards from centre. NOTE: When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre. When the heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre. (4) Place your true track (225°) under the true index. (5) Slide wind Velocity mark to True Air Speed (282 kt); Ground Speed reads under centre => 269 kt; → the closest option is 264 kt",

Therefore, we need to find the TAS for the aircraft at 14 000 ft, with OAT = ISA -15ºC and a CAS of 150 kt. Calculating TAS using a suitable flight computer (We have used a CRP-5). First, calculate the OAT: The ISA temperature at 14 000 ft = 15 - 2(14) = -13ºC. The OAT is ISA - 15ºC, so OAT = -13 - 15 = -28ºC On the computer side, in the air speed window, line up 14 000 ft with the OAT of -28ºC On the computer's inner scale, find the CAS of 150 kt, and read off the uncorrected TAS of 181 kt on the outer scale. As the TAS is under 300 kt, there is no need to make a compressibility correction. Therefore, the average TAS to be used for climb calculations is 181 kt",

            "explanation": "No calculations are required for this question, because it asks for TAS and CAS “at some point during climb” and not at a specific altitude during descent. A usefool tool in determining the changing relationship between EAS, CAS, TAS and Mach in climbs and descents, below the tropopause, is the ECTM graphs. CAS can be considered to be identical to IAS. The ECTM graphs are used to determine what happens to the other three speeds when climbing or descending, whilst holding one speed constant, by drawing initially the parameter that is to be held constant as a vertical line and drawing, later, connecting lines to the remaining letters. The lines are always in the sequence \"ECTM\", in the standard atmosphere and the speed held constant is drawn vertically. During descent with a constant Mach number, both TAS and CAS increase. Thus, since at the beginning of the descent the instruments' cross-check shows a CAS of 274 kt and a TAS of 416 kt, at a lower altitude during the descent, both TAS and CAS speeds are expected to be higher. Therefore, the only option that gives both TAS and CAS higher than 274 kt and 416 kt correspondingly, is CAS: 324 kt and TAS: 430 kt.

The mark shows a drift 9o right and Groundspeed 75 kt. Drift is the angle difference from heading to track, so the True Track is: True Track = True heading + Drift = 130o + 9o = 139o. And the distance covered from 10:07 to 10:19 (in 12 minutes) with a Groundspeed of 75 kt is: Distance = 75 kt x 12/60 hr = 15 NM.

The angle at which we want to close to come back to the planned track is the closing angle (CA). The CA will depend how much further we want to rejoin the planned track. The 1 in 60 rule can be used to calculate the TE and the CA. TE = (distance off-track/planned track distance flown) x 60 The same 1 in 60 rule can be applied to calculate the CA. CA = (distance off-track/distance at which we want to rejoin track) x 60 2.5 nm is the off-track distance; know we need to determine the distance flown along the planned track. 15' x 130 = 32.5 nm 2.5 nm ahead of the dead reckoning position: 32.5 + 2.5 = 35 nm TE = (2.5/35) x 60 = 4,3º R Point along track at which we want to rejoin the track: 50 - 35 = 15 nm CA = (2.5/15) x 60 = 10º R With both TE and CA, we can determine by how much heading change we should apply to regain track: Heading change = TE + CA = 4,3º + 10º = 14,3º The aircraft is right of track, the aircraft must fly left: New heading = 95º - 14,3º = 80,7º",
