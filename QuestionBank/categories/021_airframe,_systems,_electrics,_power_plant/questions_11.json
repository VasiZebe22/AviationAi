This DC circuit is also what charges the batteries, as batteries can only use DC. This question asks about the other direction though, from DC to AC, assuming all the AC generators have failed and the aircraft batteries have a limited supply of DC power available. To power the AC components with DC, it must be \"inverted\", to turn the flat voltage of DC into a sine wave voltage of AC. A static inverter does this, so AC equipment can run off the DC battery in the event of an AC generation failure.",

Good energy storage They are heavy Low energy density If overcharged, the water/sulphuric acid can boil and cause evaporation and damage the plates. Temperature affected: the discharge rate of a lead acid battery decreases with a decrease in temperature and vice versa. This is because the internal resistance increases at lower temperatures. Voltages: On lad: 2 volts Off lad 2.2 volts Replacement: belw 1.8 volts, and below 1.17 Specific gravity Nickel Cadmium Batteries (NiCad or NiCd) The plates are made of Nickel Oxide and Cadmium which are both suspended in a electrolyte solution of potassium hydroxide. Very low change in voltage during discharge, remains relatively the same around 1.2 volts. Low internal resistance Low maintenance Reliable Wide operating temperatures Thermal runaway: the heat generated in certain is more than what the batterie can dissipate, leading to a rapid increase in temperature. This higher temperature leads to a lower internal resistance causing an increase in charging current, therefore multiplying the effect even more. If not monitored, the battery may be completely destroyed during charging. Voltages: On lad: 1.2 volts To answer the question, nickel-cadmium batteries: Maintain a more constant voltage during discharge (Correct!) Are more prone to thermal runaway Have a lower internal resistance NiCad batteries do require venting",

Fuses are rated to a specific maximum current specified in amperes and will rupture (meaning that the fusible will melt and open the circuit) at a slightly higher value to accomodate surge as a load is switched on and is in series with the load it protects. If you replace a fuse with a higher amp one it will work but create an unsafe circuit. It could cause a failure of the device burn it up, start a fire. The fuse is designed as a safety device. It should not only be the correct amperage but also the correct voltage and fast or slow blow. In other words, if an over-current is allowed - by fitting an incorrect fuse rating, for example - there is a severe risk of an electrical fire. However, it is important to note that, in a healthy circuit, nothing will happen as long as the circuit does not encounter an overload condition. If the circuit does encounter an overload condition then that part of the circuit that the fuse protects may become a fire hazard. Note: Some students have confirmed that the option \"Overcurrent might go undetected and cause a fire.\" was correct in their exams and confirmed that the option \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" was not within the available answers. However, we have also received a couple of feedback confirming the correct option to be \"In a healthy system nothing problematic will happen.\" which makes us believe that there are at least two similar question.",

Back EMF is a backwards voltage that runs through a DC motor armature circuit, and increases with the speed of the motor. It acts like a motor speed regulator. EMF stands for electromotive force, and remember that EMF = voltage. Applied EMF - back EMF = net EMF Input voltage - back EMF = useful voltage Given that EMF increases with rotor speed, when the rotor speed is zero (the motor has yet to spin or has seized), there is no back EMF. Therefore, If a motor seizes, all the applied EMF is able to become net EMF, so applied EMF = net EMF. The opposite occurs if a motor suffers a runaway, where there is no load (therefore no net EMF) applied to slow the motor down. In this case, the high speed of the motor causes an increase in the back EMF, until the back EMF equals the applied EMF. This means the motor has a maximum speed that it can possible turn at, when the back EMF equals the voltage of the circuit.",

            "explanation": "“1) By increasing the load on an electric motor (i.e. increasing the resistance against rotation), the power output will increase as a result of an increased current flow.” Correct. An increased resistance against rotation will result in a slower motor RPM. Consequently, back emf reduces. Such reduction will cause the current to increase. Power output = voltage x current Voltage remains constant, whilst current increases => therefore power will also increase. “2) The torque of an electrical motor can be calculated by dividing the power by the motor RPM.” Correct. In simple words, torque is the twisting force which makes a motor turn. An electrical motor’s torque can be calculated by dividing the power (voltage x current) by the motor RPM: Torque = (Voltage x Current) / RPM",

This line feeds the exciter generator field coil from the voltage regulator. When the switch is pushed (off), the exciter generator will no longer produce any current, hence the exciter generator is directly controlled by the switch. The diagram is pretty complex, and does not include absolutely everything about a permanent magnet generator AC alternator, but if you wish to know how it works, the explanation below may help. Brushless AC Alternators (PMG Type) Modern aircraft AC generators are predominantly self-exciting brushless alternators, and often incorporate a permanent magnet generator. To explain this, we are going to work backwards, from what we want our final output to be, to how we get every component of that to work. A generator is made up of a magnetic field (either produced by permanent magnets or by an electric \"field\" coil which acts like a magnet) and an armature coil. One of those is spinning (rotor) and the other is stationary (stator), and which is which is decided by the input and outputs required. The armature is where AC power is generated, from the rotational energy inputted by the spinning shaft (often from an engine via constant speed drive). The basis of an AC alternator/generator (for AC output they mean the same thing) is that we wish to have the output armature windings on the stator of the main generator, so we can send the AC power straight to the bus bars. This means that the field windings on the main generator must be mounter to the rotor. This main generator is where we make the power to output to the aircraft distribution system. The voltage of the main generator is regulated by changing the strength of the magnetic field, which just means changing the voltage through the field coil. So we somehow need a way to feed voltage-regulated DC power to a spinning coil rotating at 400 Hz. We do this by having a second generator, the exciter generator, mounted on the same shaft, with the rotor this time being the armature coils (and the stator is therefore the magnetic field producer). The spinning armatures generate 3 phase AC current which is sent through a spinning rectifier to produce the field coil for the main generator. The magnetic field for the exciter generator is provided by a DC supply from the voltage regulator. If the voltage output of the main generator drops, the voltage regulator increases the voltage to the exciter field coil, and the voltage of the main generator field will increase, increasing the final output voltage. Initial excitement can be provided by a permanent magnet generator, a third generator on the same shaft, this time with a permanent magnet (field) mounter on the rotor, and the armature (stator) picking up an AC supply, then rectifying it and using it to power the exciter field or the voltage regulator, etc. When the shaft begins spinning, this will be the first thing to produce any current.",

They consist of an automatic thermo-sensitive tripping device and a manually or electrically operated switch. Therefore, besides providing protection to an AC or DC circuit, they can be used to switch a circuit on and off under certain circumstances. Circuit breakers are special because even after the circuit breaker has tripped, the circuit can be closed again, thus allowing to restore the circuit and potentially power important systems. We say that the circuit breaker is resettable (which a fuse is not). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the bimetallic and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, good for some systems but not for others. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch to trip the breaker immediately.",

They are thick copper bars with holes drilled in, where wiring can be attached to be split to go to other locations/consumers within a network. They can run off one or multiple sources of power, and are much simpler and lighter than individual wiring to every generator/consumer. A short circuit is where electricity finds an easier way to flow from high voltage to low voltage. Usually, we want that electricity to flow through our consumer, which has some resistance, but if a significantly easier route exists, the amount of current running through a consumer will decrease, as an easier path exists for the electricity. If, for instance, a loose, uninsulated wire going straight to \"ground\" touched a bus bar, then all the electricity available to the bus bar would begin to flow through this wire, as it is the easiest path to go from high voltage to low voltage, completing the circuit. This would not only be a fire hazard, as the high current would heat all components up far too much, but would also mean that all connected consumers would not receive any electrical current, and would stop working. Think of it like a \"black hole\" for electricity, all the current will be sucked down the short circuit and will not feed other consumers. To avoid this eventuality, bus bars have circuit breakers that will disconnect above a certain current. This meant that the bus bar will become isolated from the other circuits in the aircraft, and no more electricity will be lost due to this short circuit. It does, however, mean that the consumers that only take power from that bus bar will be unable to receive power for the rest of the flight.",

Batteries work with DC, therefore required the rectifier to convert from AC to DC, and the transformer to provide the correct voltage to charge the battery. The other answers are incorrect: “the AC bus via current limiters” – Current limiters will not change the power from AC to DC, therefore this is incorrect. “a static inverter” – Static inverters are used to convert DC into AC, therefore are not applicable for this scenario. “a DC transformer and rectifier” – A transformer will alter the voltage which could be required, however as mentioned above the rectifier converts AC into DC therefore is not applicable for this scenario.",

Housing lithium-ion batteries in a vented metal casing can help to prevent them from becoming a fire hazard by reducing the risk of thermal runaway, which is a condition in which the battery temperature increases rapidly, potentially leading to ignition. The vented casing allows for dissipation of heat and venting of any flammable gases that may be generated during thermal runaway. The other options listed are not effective in preventing lithium-ion batteries from becoming a fire hazard. Installing a fuse on the positive pole of the battery does not address the root cause of thermal runaway, and may not provide adequate protection against ignition. Placing a halon fire extinguisher in the compartment with the battery is not a proactive measure to prevent thermal runaway and may not be able to effectively extinguish a fire that has already started. Continuously charging the battery during flight also does not prevent thermal runaway, and may actually increase the risk of thermal runaway if the battery is overcharged or damaged in some way.",

The armature is the spinning section of an electric motor. The field coils produce an magnetic field similar to that of a permanent magnet, only stronger, and able to be changed. The armature is the spinning coil(s) of wire that interact with that magnetic field to produce rotational movement. When the electric current in the armature increases, this increases the interaction with the magnetic field and increases torque. Therefore, the current is directly proportional to the torque produced. The magnetic field produced by the field coils also affects the torque. The stronger the magnetic field, the greater the interaction with the current flowing through the armature, so the greater the torque produced. Therefore, the magnetic field strength is also directly proportional to the torque produced. Both these statements are the same, no matter how the motor is wound (in series or in parallel).",

As the mechanical load on the motor decreases, its speed increases, leading to a rise in back electromotive force (EMF). With a higher back EMF, the armature current decreases, thereby diminishing the torque applied to the motor. Torque, which represents the twisting force driving the motor, is measured in Newton-meters (Nm). It is influenced by the voltage, current, and magnetic fields within the motor.

They prevent the maximum power rating of a component to be exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High rupture capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it.",

Unfortunately, it isn't even strictly true either. Computer components do have a lifespan, and it is affected by temperature (higher temperatures are worse), but not between 30°C and 40°C. Depending on the component, the temperature operating windows for modern computer components are between 80°C and 120°C. Below this top end, a temperature change of 10°C would not half the lifespan of a component. In fact, modern computer components usually have very little variation between life expectancy at 80°C and at 30°C. Perhaps in older (a lot older) computers, this might be the case, but even then, I would be very sceptical that they would lose so much lifespan at such low temperatures unless 30°C is the maximum temperature for a particular component, where this could end up being true. That appears to be what EASA is saying though, a 10°C increase in temperature correlates to half the life expectancy.

Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. I would not refer to that as thermal runaway, but it is incredibly dangerous, and we don't think EASA knows the difference. Furthermore, damage can reduce a battery's charging capacity and circuitry that limits current flow, which can subsequently lead to overcharging/overheating, causing a true thermal runaway. The worst case scenario in a thermal runaway is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Ni-Cd fires are not as hot, but any fire is extremely bad, and these batteries are usually stored away from where people can contain the fires.",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOR gate – OR gate + NOT = inverted \"OR\" output, symbolized again by the small circle at the output of the OR gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOT gate – invert gate, used to reverse the state of the input. If input = 0, then output = 1.",

An amber FAULT light indicates an IDG oil outlet overheat or low oil pressure. When an IDG low oil pressure is detected, the pilot must operate the IDG disconnect push button. The IDG switch is guarded and normally spring loaded out. When pushed, the IDG is disconnected from its drive shaft (mechanically breaks the link between the IDG and the engine gearbox) and can only be reset on the ground by maintenance, after engine shutdown. IDGs are able to automatically disconnect when a high oil temperature occurs, and therefore require no input from the pilot on this issue, but this will have the same effect as manually disconnecting the IDG, which means that the in-built generator will be unusable for the rest of the flight, and can only be re-connected on the ground by engineers.",

Motors and generators are very similar, both in concept and in design. A motor converts electrical energy into rotation, whilst a generator converts rotation into electrical energy. They both use induction to make this happen, and therefore look very similar. This means that we can actually use one item to do both tasks, and just change whether we give it electrical energy, or rotational (kinetic) energy. We can actually use them for either piston or turbine engines, but most questions do ask about them in the context of turbine engines. They can be either AC or DC, with the smaller engines using mostly DC and larger engines (such as those on the B787) using AC. When the aircraft is being started, the starter-generator acts as an electrical \"starter\" motor, allowing the engine to get up to sufficient speed for it to have self-sustaining RPM (or idling in a piston engine). As soon as this is complete, the electricity input into the starter-generator is removed, and the generator (being still attached the spinning engine) is now generating electricity through the induction of the spinning coils, inducing current. It started the aircraft by doing the job of a motor, but then changed job, and is a generator for the rest of the flight.",

One problem appears after the rectification stage of this process as the output is fluctuating. This fluctuation makes the DC unusable for equipment use and it needs to be minimized. This is usually achieved by fitting a filter or smoothing circuit at the output of the rectifier.

Please try to remember which one you see in the exam so you can let us know in the comments if possible, thank you! Relays are widely used in aircraft electrical systems. They function as switches that use a small DC electrical current to open and close circuits carrying much larger currents (AC or DC), crucial for high-current systems operated by the crew. A small wire coil wound around a ferromagnetic core forms an electromagnet. When activated by a modest current, the electromagnet closes a switch with a hinged metallic arm that it pulls shut. When the current is switched off, the magnetic field disappears, and a spring forces the switch contacts to open. We are therefore using a very safe smaller circuit as a switch so we don't have to go anywhere near high current AC circuits, allowing them to be kept away from the flight deck, etc. The relay is physically separated (air gap/insulation) from the main circuit as otherwise the high current of the main circuit would fry the low rated relay circuit 1) The relay has physical separation from the circuit. - Correct As mentioned above. 3) The control can be fed with DC and the high current circuit can be fed with AC. - Correct The relay’s contacts are isolated from the control coil, enabling them to handle different types of currents. DC is required for the relay (control circuit) as it needs to keep the electromagnet on at a specific strength. AC or DC can be used by the main circuit, but AC is more common.",

            "explanation": "Paralleling generators is when two generators supply one bus bar. This allows the load to be shared between the two generators, and has the added advantage of maintaining power on the busbar in the event of one of the generators failing. When running the generators, it is necessary for each generator to provide half of the current required by the bas bar. In that scenario, they are load sharing. However to achieve load sharing the voltage output of both generators must be identical. If the voltage output of one generator was to exceed the other, then the current would flow towards the lower voltage generator. The scenario where the current flows from the generator with the higher voltage to the generator with the lower voltage output is known as recirculating current. In this case the higher voltage generator will be providing the current of the bus bar, and also the current demanded by the lower voltage generator. The reverse flow of the current to the generator will turn the lower voltage generator into a motor turning in the opposite direction of the rotation of the engine. Clearly this is a very undesirable situation therefore parallel systems have reverse current relays installs to prevent the reverse flow from occurring. Therefore the correct answer is that: In order for two generators to effectively load share in a parallel system, it is necessary to ensure that “their voltages are almost equal”. The other answers are incorrect because: “Equal loads are connected to each generator busbar before paralleling” Both generators supply the same busbar for there to be load sharing, therefore if they are supplying a load to the busbar they are already parallel. “Adequate voltage exists” As explained above, for there to be equal load sharing both generators must have the same voltage output, otherwise recirculating current will occur. Therefore this is incorrect. “The synchronizing bus-bar is disconnected from the busbar system” Each generator is first made to run at the correct voltage before closing its generator line contactor, therefore connecting to the busbar. This statement is therefore incorrect.",

Circuit breakers are circuit protection devices which can be \"reset\" if they trip (rather than a fuse which melts). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the thermal and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic (thermal) CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high for too long, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit, exactly like operating a switch. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, which is good for some systems but not for others. The higher the overcurrent, the faster the thermal CB will trip. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch (solenoid) to trip the breaker almost instantly. Obviously, it cannot be absolutely instant, as things take time to move and therefore a very short overcurrent will still be experienced by the circuit, so we have said that \"trips almost immediately\" is correct.",

This question is quite narrow minded, as many different types of circuit breaker exist, some of which are designed to handle transient load spikes, etc. We using best judgement here and knowledge of other similar exam questions to answer this one. Please let us know if you see either question in the exam so we can verify them, thank you! When switching on an electric motor, there is an initial inrush current that is several times the motor's full load current. This is due to the high initial torque required to overcome the motor's inertia and start the rotation. This inrush current can cause a transient overcurrent that may exceed the rated current of the circuit breaker. Their circuit breakers are often built to handle these very short term overcurrents, but would trip if the overcurrent was sustained. Other heavy electrical consumers such as heating elements, ignition boxes, and strobe lights (intermittent loads) do not have the same inrush current as electric motors, and their startup transient spikes are not as severe. In that case, they may be fitted with circuit breakers with less ability to handle transient loads. Therefore, the design and rating of circuit breakers depend on various factors such as the type of load, application, and any other specific requirements. Therefore, the selection of the appropriate circuit breaker must consider the nature of the load and the operating conditions to ensure proper protection and reliable operation.",

            "explanation": "A Ram Air Turbine (RAT) is a small wind turbine that is installed in an aircraft to be used as a source of power during emergencies. In these cases, the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. The RAT generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump. Consequently, more power is generated when the aircraft is operating at a higher speed and less is generated when operating at lower speeds. For this question we have based our explanation off the Airbus A320, as is often the reference aircraft for EASA (sometimes they also use the B737 as a reference, but it does not have a RAT). The A320 has 3 main AC generators (one per engine and one for the APU), but if all of these fail (whilst airborne), then the RAT will deploy, and once spun up, it will pressurise the blue hydraulic system using a hydraulic pump. This system then drives a hydraulic motor which spins up the emergency AC generator. The emergency AC generator provides power to the AC ESS and (via the ESS TR unit) the DC ESS bus bars, in other words, essential AC and DC services. Therefore, essential AC services is the most correct answer here. As a side note, if this were to fail also, then the batteries would then be used to feed the DC essential services and (via a static inverter) the AC essential services, but would have a limited duration, of course. The AC emergency bus is not the correct answer as often this is not the name of such a bus bar and also, it also doesn't actually describe what services are being fed.",

            "explanation": "Inside an electrical motor, when the rotor seizes, it is a similar process to putting a very large load on the motor. If this occurs, then all of a sudden, the motor is not cutting any lines of flux (moving through the magnetic field), which means that the \"back EMF\" is removed completely. This back EMF is effectively the force which acts against the electricity in a motor, reducing the electrical energy due to it being turned into kinetic energy inside the motor. (Lenz's Law) If this back EMF (resistive force) is removed, that means that for the same voltage, the current can flow much more easily, so the current will increase through the armature, sometimes by a very large amount. This can be enough to melt fuses or wires in some motors. With an increased current, the available force from the motor per turn (which are no longer occuring) will also increase, and this is known as the torque. The seizure therefore creates higher torque, similar to when a motor is intially started up. We then have to consider what happens to the current within the stator, known as the field coils, which produce the magnetic field that the rotor turns within. The current through the stator will also increase when the rotor seizes, so would have a more powerful magnetic field. This helps towards the higher torque. (This question assumes that series windings are used, it being the most common in DC motors by far). Note: The feedback on this question is not perfect. If anyone has exam feedback on this question, they can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments, thank you!",

High current, often caused by these abusive conditions, exacerbates thermal runaway by increasing the rate of temperature rise within the battery. As the temperature climbs, it can trigger a chain reaction within the battery cells, leading to the release of more energy and generating even higher temperatures.

The APU generator is essentially the same as the main engine-driven generators, so it will provide exactly the same output. The APU will electrically supply the aircraft and other associated systems on the ground when the engines are not running, and the Ground Power unit (GPU) is not connected. As to why nowadays commercial aircraft generators are integrated with a CSD in an IDGU (integrated drive generator unit) and use mainly 400 Hz AC is because a higher frequency allows the manufacturers to make smaller and lighter generators that would allow increasing the payload instead of carrying extra weight from the generators. Because the frequency of an AC generator mainly relies on the number of pairs of poles and the speed of the rotor, it is sufficient to increase the generator’s rotational speed in order to provide a higher frequency, and thus decrease the generator’s size appropriately.",

One of the biggest threats to Ni-Cd (Nickel Cadmium) and Lithium Ion Batteries is the risk of thermal runaway. The basic idea of thermal runaway is that if the battery becomes too hot (usually during charging), its internal resistance will change, causing it to produce more heat, hence heating it up further, causing a positive feedback loop that ends in extreme overheating. Lithium Ion batteries are more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. The worst case scenario is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Ni-Cd fires are not as hot, but any fire is extremely bad, and these batteries are usually stored away from where people can contain the fires. Electrical failure could happen also, as the battery will become unusable as part of this process, and it could do significant damage to the electrical system eventually, but that is still not nearly as bad as any sort of fire.",

Please let us know if you get this question in the real exam, and differences you can remember, and if you know what the correct answer was, thank you! Learning Objectives 021.09.03.00 Generation. Remark: For standardisation purposes, the following standard expressions are used: DC generator: produces DC output; DC alternator: produces AC, rectified by integrated rectifying unit, the output is DC; DC alternator: producing a DC output by using a rectifier; AC generator: produces AC output; Starter generator: integrated combination of a generator and a starter motor; Permanent magnet alternator/ generator: self-exciting AC generator. You can read the full explanation of a brushless AC alternator/generator below, but specific to this question, the rotating field coils for the main generator get their DC current from another generator on the same shaft, which is then rectified from AC to DC by a spinning rectifier on that shaft (EASA would refer to this arrangement as a DC alternator, not a DC generator). The exciter generator gets its (DC) magnetic field from the voltage regulator, which usually receives its electricity from the final 3 phase output of the whole system, but initially gets its energy from a permanent magnet generator, with the magnets mounted on the same shaft, and producing unregulated voltage output just to start the system going. The system is completely brushless, which means that the only method of transferring electricity from a spinning component to a rotating component is without physical contact, so no brushes, slip rings, carbon contacts, etc. That removes 2 answers immediately. For the other two possible options: Permanent Magnet Generator: This answer is the most recent feedback, and is partially correct, but is usually just used for the initial excitation current. Smaller DC generator on the end of the alternator: This could also be correct, particularly if it said DC alternator, as that is effectively what the exciter and bridge rectifier are acting as. Brushless AC Alternators (PMG Type) Modern aircraft AC generators are predominantly self-exciting brushless alternators, and often incorporate a permanent magnet generator. To explain this, we are going to work backwards, from what we want our final output to be, to how we get every component of that to work. A generator is made up of a magnetic field (either produced by permanent magnets or by an electric \"field\" coil which acts like a magnet) and an armature coil. One of those is spinning (rotor) and the other is stationary (stator), and which is which is decided by the input and outputs required. The armature is where AC power is generated, from the rotational energy inputted by the spinning shaft (often from an engine via constant speed drive). The basis of an AC alternator/generator (for AC output they mean the same thing) is that we wish to have the output armature windings on the stator of the main generator, so we can send the AC power straight to the bus bars. This means that the field windings on the main generator must be mounter to the rotor. This main generator is where we make the power to output to the aircraft distribution system. The voltage of the main generator is regulated by changing the strength of the magnetic field, which just means changing the voltage through the field coil. So we somehow need a way to feed voltage-regulated DC power to a spinning coil rotating at 400 Hz. We do this by having a second generator, the exciter generator, mounted on the same shaft, with the rotor this time being the armature coils (and the stator is therefore the magnetic field producer). The spinning armatures generate 3 phase AC current which is sent through a spinning rectifier to produce the field coil for the main generator. The magnetic field for the exciter generator is provided by a DC supply from the voltage regulator. If the voltage output of the main generator drops, the voltage regulator increases the voltage to the exciter field coil, and the voltage of the main generator field will increase, increasing the final output voltage. Initial excitement can be provided by a permanent magnet generator, a third generator on the same shaft, this time with a permanent magnet (field) mounted on the rotor, and the armature (stator) picking up an AC supply, then rectifying it and using it to power the exciter field or the voltage regulator, etc. When the shaft begins spinning, this will be the first thing to produce any current.",

Good energy storage They are heavy Low energy density If overcharged, the water/sulphuric acid can boil and cause evaporation and damage the plates. Temperature affected: the discharge rate of a lead-acid battery decreases with a decrease in temperature and vice versa. This is because the internal resistance increases at lower temperatures. Voltages: On load: 2 volts Off load 2.2 volts Replacement: below 1.8 volts, and below 1.17 Specific gravity Nickel Cadmium Batteries (NiCad or NiCd) The plates are made of Nickel Oxide and Cadmium which are both suspended in an electrolyte solution of potassium hydroxide. Very low change in voltage during discharge remains relatively the same around 1.2 volts. Low internal resistance Low maintenance Reliable Wide operating temperatures Thermal runaway: the heat generated in certain is more than what the batterie can dissipate, leading to a rapid increase in temperature. This lower temperature leads to a lower internal resistance causing an increase in charging current, therefore multiplying the effect even more. If not monitored, the battery may be completely destroyed during charging. Voltages: On load: 1.2 volts To answer the question, nickel-cadmium batteries: Maintain a more constant voltage during discharge (Correct!) Are more prone to thermal runaway Have a lower internal resistance NiCad batteries do require venting",

The biggest (yellow square) represents the entire IDG system: it is composed of the engine-driven AC generator (green square) and the CSD (blue square). Finally, you can observe that the IDG is driven by the engine through the engine gearbox via a simple shaft. This shaft is connected to the CSD first, but if it disconnects, it will disconnect the whole IDG, not only the CSD part. Once again, by observing the attached figure you can eliminate the other answer options: ‘Shaft from the oil system’ – It can be correct as the engine gear box’ shaft is not connected directly in any way to the oil circulation system. ‘Generator from the CSD’ – This cannot be correct either as the generator is connected to the CSD by the PMG, which is the Permanent Magnet Generator connected to the CSD on the output ring gear of the differential assembly.

            "explanation": "Most modern aircraft with a twin engine design use a split bus system (rather than a parallel bus system), which differ in their distribution slightly. Split bus systems have a left AC bus and a right AC bus, and are fed solely by the single engine generator on that side. There is no connection between the two buses (in normal operation) as that would require the generators to be \"paralleled\" to each other, which means extra complexity. Parallel bus systems, on the other hand, are more useful when 3 or 4 engined aircraft are used, as each generator has its own AC bus bar to feed the aircraft electrical loads, but the generators are all paralleled to each other and there is a synchronising bus bar connecting all of the individual circuits. This is more useful for load sharing in the event of a generator failure, and general load sharing for unbalanced systems, meaning each generator produces the same load under normal operation. It does mean that some or all generators do have to be paralleled though, which is a bit of added complexity, matching their frequency, voltage and phase. That complexity is removed in the split bus system. Having a 4 engine-generator aircraft with a split bus system is still perfectly doable, but there are a few different ways it can be implemented, in terms of which bus bars get tied together in the event of a failure. \"Each pair of generators is connected to a common AC bus.\" This would require two generators to be paralleled on each side, which is sometimes called a partial parallel system (I believe the 747 has this), and is not a split bus system \"All 4 generators are connected to a common AC bus.\" This is a completely parallel bus system, not split bus. \"The AC buses are connected with bus-tie breakers.\" This is what happens in a split-bus system when a failure occurs, the failed generator is isolated from its bus bar, and the bus bar is then connected to a neighbouring bus bar to use it's electricity. This is not the case in normal operation. \"Each generator is connected to its own dedicated AC bus bar.\" Yes, as mentioned above, in the split bus system, each generator solely feeds its own AC bus bar in normal operation (maybe two if there is a generator failure somewhere else).",

This is why landing at the nearest suitable airfield is important, as well as load-shedding if necessary, to reduce the power draw from the batteries.

A starter warning light signifies that the starter is activated, regardless of whether it rotates. If the starter warning light remains illuminated, it could signal that the starter motor and engine haven't disengaged. In this scenario, the pilot should promptly shut down the engine if either the starter motor warning light remains on or if the oil pressure fails to rise immediately after startup. Waiting for 30 seconds is quite a long time for the light to extinguish, according to standard procedures. \"The starter warning light is illuminated when the starter motor clutch is engaged\": Starters and starter-generator units often feature a warning light indicating when the starter motor clutch fails to disengage properly, indicating that the clutch remains engaged.

Transformer Rectifier Units (TRU’s) combine both a transformer and a rectifier. Therefore, they convert Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC) and also transform a certain voltage into another voltage. First, the transformation of voltage occurs whilst the current is in its AC state, then the unit gets to work turning the alternating current (which travels backwards and forwards within the circuit), into direct current which only flows one way. One problem then appears after this rectification stage as the output is now all in one direction, but is fluctuating. This fluctuation makes the direct current unusable. To make it a constant current, a filter, or smoothing circuit is used just before the output of the rectifier. This current should be made to remain the same, regardless of the load applied.

            "explanation": "Circuit breakers are circuit protection devices which can be \"reset\" if they trip (rather than a fuse which melts). The most common circuit breakers (CBs) are the thermal and magnetic CBs. The bi-metallic (thermal) CB consists of two strips of metal bonded together. The current flowing through the bonded metals will heat them and make them expand and bend. If the flowing current is too high for too long, the strip will bend so much that it will move a latch, tripping the circuit breaker and opening the circuit. Because the functioning of the bi-metallic CB relays on the time it will take to heat it up, small overcurrents of short duration are allowed, which is good for some systems but not for others. The higher the overcurrent, the faster the thermal CB will trip. There are, therefore, other CB types that are more responsive. That’s exactly what a magnetic CB is. An abnormal increase of the circuit's current over the maximum rating will act on an electromagnet in the circuit breaker, pulling a magnetic switch (solenoid) to trip the breaker almost instantly. Obviously, it cannot be absolutely instant, as things take time to move and therefore a very short overcurrent will still be experienced by the circuit, so we have said that \"trips almost immediately\" is correct. Note that we still require further feedback to confirm how the question was laid out, and what correct answer the examiner has chosen (the use of \"almost immediately\" is not exact and they could take a different view), thank you.",

The basic idea of thermal runaway is that if the battery becomes too hot (usually during charging), its internal resistance will change, causing it to produce more heat, hence heating it up further, causing a positive feedback loop that ends in extreme overheating. Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. This is called an internal short circuit. It can cause a chain reaction (increased heat - increased resistance - increased heat, etc) and is incredibly dangerous. Furthermore, a lower amount of damage can reduce a battery's charging capacity and circuitry that limits current flow, which can subsequently lead to overcharging/overheating, causing a thermal runaway during charging. The worst case scenario with a damaged battery is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot, in the thousands of degrees Celsius.",

The other answer that we have feedback for is B: \"the busbar will be switched to another busbar\", which has a bad wording, but could be referring to \"connecting\" the two busbars together. Most modern aircraft with a twin engine design use a split bus system (rather than a parallel bus system), which differ in their distribution slightly. Split bus systems have a left AC bus and a right AC bus, and are fed solely by the engine generator on that side. There is no connection between the two busses (in normal operation) as that would require the generators to be \"paralleled\" to each other, which means extra complexity. This means that, if one generator fails, say the right generator for example, the right AC bus bar (and the right DC bus bar in most systems) would have no available power. This is when the generator circuit breaker (GCB) for the right generator would open, isolating the failed generator, and the bus tie breakers (BTBs) between the left and right AC busses would close, allowing the right AC bus to be fed from the left generator, via the left AC bus. This is just \"connecting\" the bus bars together. So far, this has all happened automatically, and the scenario is now stable, so the pilots can run checklists and decide what to do next. The left generator will be working hard at this point to feed all the onboard electricity, so the pilots would decide to start the APU (if it is available), and the right AC bus would likely be fed directly by the APU, and one of the BTBs opened to isolate the two AC busses from each other again.",

            "explanation": "Fuses and circuit breakers aim to protect every electrical circuit. They prevent the maximum power rating of a component or wire from being exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High Rupture Capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it. We can now go through the options: \"Upon reaching its nominal amperage, the fuse instantly melts.\" Incorrect. A fuse's \"nominal amperage\" is an amperage that it is able to handle continuously with no problem, as nominal operations are completely expected. \"Upon reaching its rated amperage, the fuse instantly melts.\" Incorrect. The rated amperage of a fuse is the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. Therefore, it should not melt at this amperage. \"The fuse must be as close as possible to the source to protect against short circuits.\" Correct. Whilst it may stray from the learning objectives a little, this option is correct as fuses are made to protect circuits from overcurrent, and therefore we wish to protect as much as possible of each circuit from overcurrent, particularly in the event of a short circuit, as they can happen anywhere on a wire or in a component and fry the source, wires or other components in the circuit. \"The fuse provides protection against voltage exceedances.\" Incorrect. Fuses protect from overcurrent, not voltage exceedances.",

Think of the busbar as a meeting point where electricity from the generator is distributed to various parts of a system. When there's a big difference in the electrical characteristics (like current, voltage, or frequency) between the generator and the busbar, it's a sign that something might be wrong. This difference can indicate issues within the generator itself or in the wiring that connects it to the busbar. A differential fault specifically refers to this significant mismatch. It's a critical issue because it can lead to malfunctions or damage in the electrical system. To detect these faults, a special device called a differential relay is used. This relay constantly monitors the balance between the generator and the busbar. When it detects a large discrepancy, it triggers protective measures to prevent further damage or system failure.",

Learning Objective 021.09.04.03.02: Describe the following distribution consequences: power transfer between different power supplies; power transfer in the event of a supply failure; loss of all normal AC supplies. The two primary methods of distributing AC power in an aircraft are via the split bus and parallel bus systems. Split bus systems have each generator feeding its own load bus, which are not usually connected at all. They run independently of each other, and usually have a TRU (Transformer Rectifier Unit) each to provide DC electrical power. Parallel bus systems are naturally \"paralleled\" when possible, and have a synchronising bus (or sometimes 2) which means that many generators are all putting power into all the load busses. This system is most commonly used on aircraft with more than 2 engines, for simplicity. In the event of a generator failure in a split bus system, the generator is cut off from its load bus and the BTB (Bus Tie Breaker) is closed to allow the working generator to feed both load busses. The APU can then be used to take over the failed generator and return the system back to normal if it is available. As this happens after generator cut-off, there is no need to parallel the supplies in normal service. In a parallel bus system, a generator failure means that the failed generator will be cut off from the rest of the system, and the load busses will all be fed from the remaining generators that are already connected to it, so essentially the bus tie breaker is already closed, and the generator just needs to be disconnected via the GCB (Generator Circuit Breaker). The batteries provide DC power, which can be put through an inverter to feed the essential AC bus, but this would only occur in the event of a multiple generator failure, where the batteries are the only remaining power source.",

Direct current is the simplest to consider, charge flows from high potential to low potential (conventional) through electrical conductors continuously, all in the same direction. Alternating current is a little more complex, where the charge flows backwards and forwards through an electrical conductor, with the current increasing in one direction, then in the opposite direction, and so on. The majority of light aircraft simply use a DC electrical system (often 14 V or 28 V), as this is usually the simplest to generate and distribute through a simple aircraft with few consumers. Larger aircraft use AC systems (often 3 phase, 115 V, 400 Hz) as they require increased power generation and have consumers require high loads. They also have some loads onboard that require DC power, so have this capability also. Electricity can be transferred between the two different types (AC and DC) by the use of rectifiers and inverters. AC is \"rectified\" to turn it into DC (think of it that AC is too complex, and it has to be fixed [\"rectified\"] to turn it into simple direct current). In aircraft, we do not want to turn 115 V AC straight into DC, it would be far too much for the 28 V circuits, so first a transformer is used to bring the voltage down to 28 V, and then it is rectified. Aircraft use an integrated Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) for these job, to go from high voltage AC to lower voltage DC. DC can be \"inverted\" into alternating current, and this is quite intuitive, as AC is just DC, flipped backwards and forwards many times per second, and then smoothed into a sine wave. Aircraft will often have an inverter on board, for operations where the aircraft needs to use a DC power source like batteries to power it's AC consumers. As with the rectification process, the low voltage DC will create low voltage AC, which will need to go through a step-up transformer to reach the usual 115 V AC required.",

Nonetheless, if you do see this in the exam, you can still answer correctly of course. A capacitor is a form of short-term electrical storage device, which stores a small amount charge on one side of the capacitor, which can be rapidly gained or lost. They are used in disposable cameras to produce the flash (they have thousands of other uses, but this is one of the most easily understood). In an AC circuit, though, capacitors cause the current to shift in relation to the voltage. The current leads the voltage, by up to 90º phase difference. There is a mechanic that drives this, but we do not need to know it (we actually should not need to know any of this on the current syllabus). The difference between voltage and current causes a reduction in power called capacitive reactance, which causes inefficiency in the circuit. The effect of capacitive reactance reduces at higher frequencies (the alternating current alternates more times per second), and this allows the current to increase at these higher frequencies. theoretically, at infinite frequency, the capacitive reactance would have no effect, and the AC circuit would act as if no capacitor were present at all. Therefore, an increase in frequency causes an increase in current for the same voltage.",

It is also used a lot in the study of electrics, as frequency measures the number of cycles that occur per unit time. For the ATPLs, as per the learning objective above, the examiner is talking about alternating current (AC), which has a varying voltage and current across it, going from maximum in one direction, to maximum in the other direction, many times per second. This looks like a sine wave, and can be measured in \"cycles\", with one cycle being from peak to peak, or from trough to trough. Frequency is the measure of how many cycles occur per unit of time. The SI (French - Système International - International system of units) for frequency is Hertz (Hz), which is \"cycles per second\". (Because \"cycles\" is a number without a unit, the derivation of Hertz from base units is actually just \"per second\", or s-1).",

Static wicks dissipate precipitation static that can develop as you fly through areas of uncharged particles. These particles can exist as you fly through solid or liquid particles such as rain, snow, fog, dust or ash. As the airplane flies through the particles, positive charges deflect and negative charges attach to the airframe, building up and eventually discharging at certain points of the airframe where the static wicks are generally attached.

In other words, it is a hydromechanical unit that turns the physical motion of oil/fluid into an AC or DC current. The output of the hydraulic motor, and therefore the speed of the motor is dictated by the angle of the swashplate. The angle of the swash plate will either limit or increase the oil flow towards the hydraulic and in turn affect the rpm of the engine. The angle of the swash plate is controlled by the speed governor, which in turn is controlled by the load controller. The load controller senses the output frequency of the alternator and will adjust the swash plate accordingly to increase or decrease the torque output to the generator. The CSD can be disconnected from the engine drive shaft at any time during the flight. However, only the engineers can reconnect the CSD, on the ground, with the engines off.",

Lithium Ion batteries are even more prone to it than the old Ni-Cd batteries, and it can happen much more quickly. It often happens due to overcharging/overheating and a combination of the two. Damage is also a massive factor in the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, as these have very high energy densities, so can suffer from very high currents if two different parts of the battery meet unexpectedly. The worst case scenario in a thermal runaway is that a fire begins. Fire is pretty much the worst case scenario onboard any aircraft, other than complete structural failure perhaps, and lithium ion battery fires burn extremely hot. Almost all lithium ion batteries are made up of separate cells packed next to each other, with a battery controller linking the cells together and providing balanced charging, discharge, etc. Any fire from one cell (which burns incredibly hot as we have mentioned) will almost certainly spread to the other cells, and there is no way that most battery cases are able to contain that fire, as they burn in the region of thousands of degrees.",

Therefore it converts Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC) whilst at the same time transforming a certain voltage into another. These units are used in situations where AC distribution system needs to supply a DC system. The other answers are incorrect: “Rectifiers and voltage reducing resistors” – Even though rectifiers are commonly used to convert AC to DC, using resistors to lower the voltage have many disadvantages. Firstly, resistors dissipate power as heat, therefore the system will lose energy to lower the voltage, this is something that transformers typically do not. Secondly, the voltage drop of a resistor is dependent on the load, therefore cause fluctuations in voltage. This is something that doesn’t typically happen with transformers. “AC-DC Regulators” – Regulators work very similarly to resistors, hence they lose energy by turning it into heat. Therefore they are much less efficient than transformers. “Portable batteries” – Even though portable batteries would be able to power the DC power, and it is required that batteries can power the main system in case of an emergency, they would not be able to power the aircraft for the entire flight. Therefore DC batteries would never entirely power the DC system unless in an emergency.",

This back EMF is effectively the force which acts against the electricity in a motor, reducing the electrical current due to the energy being turned into kinetic energy. (Lenz's Law) The back EMF acts against the armature coil, which is the set of spinning coils in the centre of the motor. If this back EMF (resistive force) is reduced, that means that for the same voltage, the current can flow more easily, so the current will increase. With an increased current, the available force from the motor per turn will also increase, and this is known as the torque. Therefore, to summarise, increasing the load on a DC motor decreases the spin speed, which decreases the electrical resistance (back EMF), thereby increasing the current, which increases the torque.",

This may be automatic or manual, and some aircraft have a \"shed bus\" or multiple of them, which automatically stop being powered when a generator fails, or the load becomes too high, etc. Manual load shedding can be done by removing systems such as IFE (in-flight entertainment) or galley power, which are the first systems to go.",

It works in the opposite sense to a motor, and turns the rotation into electrical energy. It requires the field coils to produce a magnetic field, which is then spinning (due to the rotation) and inducing a voltage on the fixed armature coils around the edge of the motor. The frequency of the AC output is governed by the constant speed drive, and the voltage is governed by the voltage regulator. The voltage (usually 115 V AC) is constantly produced by the generator, due to the voltage regulator modifying the amount of current that flows through the field coils. This voltage will change based on the electrical load applied within that circuit. If the electrical load increases, the current flow will increase, which will cause a drop in the voltage over the armature coils. You can think of this as the generator not being able to provide free extra power without making any changes. The voltage reduction is sensed by the voltage regulator, which then increases the excitation current through the field coils, increasing the strength of the magnetic field, and providing a higher output voltage to stabilise the change.",

They prevent the maximum power rating of a component or wire from being exceeded by breaking the circuit if the current increases above that rating. Unlike circuit breakers, fuses cannot be reset after they break the circuit. There’re 3 types of fuses commonly used in electrical circuits: Cartridge fuse – tubular glass or ceramic body, 2 brass end caps and a tinned copper wire (or silver wire, or pure zinc). High rupture capacity (HRC) – designed for high current rated equipment. Current limiter fuse – high melting point fuses allowing them to carry a significant overload current before rupturing. All fuses have a current-specific rating (in amperes) that will indicate the maximum current they will be able to carry continuously or intermittently without excessively heating and rupturing. The rating of a fuse is designed so that it is not less than the current normally flowing in the circuit, but it ruptures just slightly below the safety limit of the equipment used. A fuse simply consists of a type of wire, as described above, that has a low melting point. As it is placed in series, the excessive electrical load will melt the wire and rupture the flow of current, should it be higher than the fuse’s ampere rating engraved upon it.",

The APU generator is essentially the same as the main engine-driven generators, so it will provide exactly the same output. The APU will electrically supply the aircraft and other associated systems on the ground when the engines are not running, and the Ground Power unit (GPU) is not connected. As to why nowadays commercial aircraft generators are integrated with a CSD in an IDGU (integrated drive generator unit) and use mainly 400 Hz AC is because a higher frequency allows the manufacturers to make smaller and lighter generators that would allow increasing the payload instead of carrying extra weight from the generators. Because the frequency of an AC generator mainly relies on the number of pairs of poles and the speed of the rotor, it is sufficient to increase the generator’s rotational speed in order to provide a higher frequency, and thus decrease the generator’s size appropriately.",

Logic gates are the building blocks of computer processing. Computers operate at the deepest level in binary, a series of transistors holding either a value of 1 or 0. Logic gates allow these 1s and 0s to be calculated, and these very simple functions can be combined and programmed at a much higher level that can then become computer programs. For our simple purposes, an integrated circuit may have several gate circuits with several different entries, but only one single output will result. The five basic logic gates are the following: AND gate – All or Nothing gate. Both inputs must be 1 to generate a 1. OR gate – Any or All gate. If at least one input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. The output will be 0 only if both inputs are 0. NAND gate – AND gate + NOT = inverted \"AND\" output, symbolized by the small circle at the output of the gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOR gate – OR gate + NOT = inverted \"OR\" output, symbolized again by the small circle at the output of the OR gate along with the bar over the “C”. NOT gate – invert gate, used to reverse the state of the input. If input = 0, then output = 1.",

AC (Alternating Current) electricity does not flow straight down the wires like DC does, it actually flows forwards and backwards, many times per second. In Europe, the mains electricity supply is AC, and the frequency of the AC is 50 Hz, meaning that the sine wave of voltage repeats 50 times per second (this is actually 100 \"flips\" per second, but we measure from peak to peak as 1 wave).

The static may build up unequally between aircraft parts and this could lead to sparks between the components. These sparks could lead to a fire. Therefore aircraft bonding between parts is installed to prevent the potential difference from being created between the parts, and therefore preventing any sparks from occurring. Bonding in itself is simply to connect all components of the aircraft with flexible wire strips, creating an easy path for electrons to pass between parts. On top of assuring a equal potential difference, the bonding system can also be used as a earth return system for a unipole circuit. Incorrect answers: “eliminate the need for grounding the aircraft during refuelling.” – The wires create a connection between the aircraft parts, but not to the ground. “prevent the aircraft being struck by lightning.” – Even though the grounding system will help the electrons from the lighting pass through the aircraft, it will not prevent the aircraft from being hit by a lightning strike. “ensure the electrical potential of the aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.” – The bonding system ensures that the potential difference between the components is zero, not that the entire aircraft structure remains at 0 volts.",

Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulfur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials.

            "explanation": "Let's go through each answer: \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the difference between maximum load limit for flaps extended and clean wing is necessary as structural strength of the wing is lower with flaps extended.\" This is saying that the wing is weaker when flaps are extended. This is not correct, as the wing structure does not rely of the flaps. What actually causes the lower maximum load factor with flaps extended is the flap mechanism. With flaps extended, the higher the load factor, the more force is travelling through the mechanism which locks the flaps down, which are moving parts, so not as strong as the wing itself. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor with flaps extended will be higher than the load factor in the clean configuration.\" The load factor is simply lift/weight, and in straight and level flight, the lift will always equal the weight, therefore the load factor is 1, whether the flaps are up and down. It has not specified straight flight, but the same would be true in a turn of a particular bank angle; load factor is the same, with or without flaps. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the margin between current load factor and maximum load factor decreases with increased bank angle.\" Correct. In a level turn, the aircraft's wings have to produce a higher lift force, as the lift force is no longer straight upwards, but is instead pointing into the direction of turn somewhat. The steeper the bank angle, the greater the lift force has to be (to remain level), which means that the actual load factor has to increase. As the maximum load factor is a fixed value, the margin between actual and maximum decreases with increased bank angle. \"In level and unaccelerated flight. the load factor at which structural damage occurs can never be more than +2.0G when flaps are extended.\" We had no feedback for this option, so made this up to fill in the gap.

Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft manoeuvres, for instance by entering a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular for this scenario, an increased load on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain present. Therefore, for this question, any force increase will increase the stress on the aircraft (as stress is force per unit area) and any stress will increase strain (the aircraft's deformation due to the stress).",

One important step is to check the maintenance documents. These documents are like the airplane's history books. They keep track of all the maintenance work that has been done on the plane, including any repairs or inspections related to its structure. By looking at these documents, the pilot can see if everything has been properly taken care of according to the rules and guidelines. One of these documents is the aircraft's tech log, which is used to record the operational status of an aircraft. It serves as a detailed record of the aircraft's flights, maintenance activities, and any reported issues or discrepancies. \"Speak to a maintenance engineer\" Incorrect: While speaking to a maintenance engineer can provide valuable insights and guidance regarding the aircraft's condition, it may not always be feasible or practical for a pilot to consult with an engineer directly, especially in time-sensitive situations. Additionally, relying solely on verbal communication may not offer the comprehensive documentation and verification needed to ensure the integrity of the aircraft's structure. \"Review the flight crew's credentials\" Incorrect: Reviewing the flight crew's credentials is essential for ensuring that qualified personnel are operating the aircraft. However, it doesn't directly address the structural integrity of the aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.01.02.01.01: Explain how stress and strain are always present in an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark: Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of stress on a material. An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. For instance, when stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. Also, The weight of the whole aircraft is being opposed by reaction forces that travel through the landing gear and all the structurally load bearing components of the structure. These are amongst the many forces acting on a stationary aeroplane. The forces are very different when flying in straight and level (1 G) flight, where, for instance, the wings are suspending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. The rest of the aircraft also sustains new forces, such as that of pressurisation on the pressure hull. The forces change again during manoeuvres, taxi, take-off and landing. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times.",

Safe-Life: This is de minimum life during which it is known that no catastrophic damage should occur. The life of such a structure can be defined in different ways, cycles, flight hours, pressurization events or calendar time. After this interval has been reached the structure should be replaced, inspected or overhauled per manufacturers recommendations. Fail-safe: When a structure fails there is alternative load-path provided by an adjacent part which is able to take over the loads for a limited amount of time. This normally should be enough time until the next periodic inspection where the damage should be identified and the damaged part replaced. “existence of more than one load path” This complies with the Fail-Safe design. “replacement of a part after a given number of cycles or hours of use” This is a Safe-Life design. “inability to withstand a certain amount of weakening of the structure without catastrophic failure” Note that it states Inability, a fail-safe design can withstand some weakening because the loads will be carried by adjacent structures. “impossibility to inspect the structure” This does not really have something to do with a fail-safe design, also airplanes are designed that practically everything can be inspected.",

Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulphur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. The salt from the oceans is a large factor in this.

            "explanation": "The rate of corrosion is the speed at which any given metal deteriorates in a specific environment. The performance of atmospherically exposed metals depends on five main factors: temperature, humidity, rainfall, Sulphur dioxide (pollution) concentration in the air, and air salinity. Temperature - an increase in temperature will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. A rule of thumb is that temperature increases of 10°C will double the corrosion rate. Humidity - has a direct effect on the rate of corrosion of metals. The higher the humidity, the higher the rate of corrosion. Rainfall - leads to an increased humidity - therefore, higher rate of corrosion. Sulphur Dioxide (pollution) - is known to cause considerable damage to materials. These pollutants can accelerate the rate of corrosion. Air Salinity - an increase in air salinity levels will generally cause an increase in the corrosion rate. Over the ocean at low altitude, the air will have a high salinity, leading to a build up of salt on the airframe, which, when mixed with water, can lead to fast corrosion of metal. The best way to deal with the operator's problem would be to wash the aircraft as often as they can, and very thoroughly, to clear off the salt and replace it with clean water that corrodes metal much less. The correct option (rightly) mentions the engine too, as this can build up salt deposits in just the same way as the airframe does, and corrosion is obviously much more dangerous when there are pieces of metal spinning at 50 000 RPM. Whilst the best long term fix for this issue would be changing the fleet of aircraft to ones more suited to the task, this would be immensely expensive, and maybe not even possible. Yes, if you were doing some light aircraft intelligence, surveillance or reconnaissance work, then you could change to a fleet of composite aircraft to remove the risk of corrosion, which is a huge investment, but there are aircraft available for that type of operation, so is possible. However, if you were doing oil spill response or something which requires large jets, they are all metal and all subject to corrosion (except some of the newer jets like B787 and A350), so this answer is not feasible.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us using the comments, the feedback section of your dashboard, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Cyclic loading is the application of repeated or fluctuating stresses, strains, or stress intensities to locations on structural components. For instance, a cyclic load may be on the fuselage on each landing as a result of the impact on touchdown or the force of pressurisation on the fuselage and bulkheads, which increases and decreases regularly per flight. The degradation that may occur at the location is referred to as fatigue degradation or failure. Many of an aircraft's cyclic loads have to be kept track of, to ensure the correct maintenance takes place on the components involved, as degradation is high with these repetitive loads in the same locations. We are therefore saying that the correct answer here is \"cyclic loads\", but cyclic loads can also be considered to be dynamic loads as they change in intensity (not static loads), so we think it is misleading to have both options present. The other two options are not even close to being correct.",

As stated in the Learning Objective above, there are three types of load, but they are not completely mutually exclusive. Static loads are loads that do not change in size, position or direction. These could be loads such as the weight of the aircraft through the wheels when parked, or the tension on the upper skin of the wing when on the ground. They are quite easy to account for. Dynamic loads are loads that do change in size, position or direction. They must be accounted for more heavily by engineers, as a constantly changing load can cause more fatigue or early failure if not expected. There are countless dynamic loads on an aircraft, taxiing loads, the engine pylons, the bending of the wing spar in turbulent flight, the control surfaces during manoeuvring, etc. Cyclic loads are a special type of the aforementioned loads. They are loads which have expected cycles, the main one being the pressurisation cycle of the aircraft. It is a static load when non-pressurised and when fully pressurised, but dynamic as it changes. The cyclical nature does mean that engineers can build it to last, and monitor it's progress also, giving an aircraft a number of available pressurisation cycles, which can dictate its lifespan. This question simply wants you to know that there are constantly loads of all types occuring on an aircraft at all times. static loads also occur whilst in flight, and dynamic loads occur on the ground, even when parked (wind, boarding, etc.), so the two statements are both incorrect.",

Unfortunately, the wording makes this question rather difficult to answer at all, and the answer we evaluated as \"most correct\" is not correct in the exams. Please send any exam feedback you can remember to us in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! Large aircraft are built to be flown almost continuously. After an aircraft has been parked for any significant length of time (it is unclear how long this is classed to be - anecdotal reports indicate as little as a week of being parked), the aircraft must be checked over by an engineer, subject to engine runs, fully powered-up, etc., to inspect for airworthiness. It is very difficult to find authoritative documents for this, as it will vary from operator to operator, and from aircraft to aircraft, manufacturer to manufacturer, etc. The two types of maintenance are \"on-condition maintenance\", where each part is checked to see if maintenance is required on a regular basis; and \"hard time maintenance\", where every component is overhauled or replaced after a certain amount of time/number of cycles. We would consider this scenario to be \"on-condition maintenance\", but the examiner may well disagree with that. See the individual explanations of each option below. We can look at each option individually: \"The aircraft can be considered airworthy provided a visual inspection of the aircraft does NOT reveal technical malfunctions. This is referred to as condition monitoring.\" Reported as incorrect. What this option describes is effectively a pre-flight check, as the person undertaking the inspection is not identified, and the pilot must do this before every flight anyway, and therefore does not include the fact that the aircraft has been parked for a while. \"The airworthiness maintenance statement could also contain a due date for hard-time maintenance after a certain number of cycles.\" This option is phrased very badly, but at the moment it is our best guess at the correct answer. It is all quite true, and some items are not expected to wear whilst the aircraft is parked, etc., but the words \"due date\" are misleading as how can it be known when an aircraft will complete that many cycles in the future? We think that maybe the examiner has not considered this phrasing, and means due date as a fixed number of cycles, not an actual date. \"After each parking period, irrespective of the duration, the airworthiness maintenance statement will need to be revised. This is an example of a hard-time maintenance method.\" Reported as incorrect. This answer has flaws. The engineers will revise the airworthiness maintenance statement by performing an inspection and testing when the aircraft is coming back to service after being parked. We would, however, argue that this is not an example of hard time maintenance, which is the flaw in this option. \"The maintenance statement remains always valid up to the flight time limits provided.\" No, the aircraft must certainly be checked over after a period of being parked, as per the main explanation above.",

If you have any further exam feedback against this question, please put it in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com An aircraft is constantly subject to various forces; tension, compression, torsion and shearing forces are all occurring in an aircraft in varying amounts. Any of these forces can be described in terms of stress and strain. Stress is the measure of force applied (per unit of cross-sectional area) whereas strain is the measure of deformation, usually as a proportion of the original size of the component. They are present on almost every item in some way, and are present in a multitude of different ways on an aircraft at all times. When an aircraft enters a turn, the load factor on the wings increases, as the wings are now required to produce more lift than before. This leads to a change in the stress (and therefore strain) on the aircraft, in particular, an increased load (stress) on the wing spars and roots, which cause a flex in the wing, demonstrating the extra strain.",

For structural items, this is usually multiple load paths, so that if one breaks, the other can take the required forces without fully breaking.

Sometimes this is by literally breaking down the composition of the other substance, which is the most dramatic form of corrosion. This happens when one of the substances is corrosive to the other one. For instance, Mercury is HIGHLY corrosive to aluminium, and burns straight through aluminium if the two come into contact (also producing toxic fumes; they really are not a very pleasant combination). To address the options in this question: Mercury is corrosive (to aluminium and a few other metals particularly) as stated earlier. Battery Acid is corrosive also. It is quite easy to remember this one, for obvious reasons. Fuel is not corrosive, which is very useful for storage (but it can allow the breeding of bacteria that can be corrosive to metal fuel tanks). Hydraulic Fluid is annoyingly complex when it comes to corrosiveness. One of the favourable properties of a good hydraulic fluid is for it to be non-corrosive. This is the case when it is in contact with metal, but it can be corrosive to paintwork, certain types of rubber seals, etc. Water is corrosive due to oxidisation, which causes rust. It is not highly corrosive, but the air contained within water will slowly break down materials like unprotected metals. Toilet Waste is a mixture of water (corrosive) and ammonia, as well as bacteria, all of which are corrosive to various materials",

Mercury is the only metal element which is liquid at room temperature. Over the last few centuries, it has had many uses, from measuring pressure, to temperature, and more. It is, however, toxic, and produces a gas which is toxic to humans over time, and before that can cause brain chemistry changes leading insanity (there is an interesting story about the origin of the phrase \"as mad as a hatter\" from the 17th century, if you look it up). It also reacts very strongly with aluminium, which corrodes the aluminium very rapidly, and is the reason that mercury thermometers are not longer allowed on aircraft, as any spillage could corrode a hole through the fuselage, which is primarily made of aluminium on most aircraft. The only other close option here would be pottasium hydroxide, which can be corrosive to many metals, including aluminium, but not at nearly the same rate as mercury. It also does not produce toxic fumes, but is hazardous to the skin if it comes in contact. It is the electrolyte used in a few different battery types, but not really part of the syllabus, so we do not need to know anything about it, and therefore it is not the correct answer.

Prompt detection and removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to an aircraft and its components. Aircraft should be washed at regularly scheduled intervals to remove acidic contaminants, such as airborne pollutants, from the surface. This is especially true when operating over warm oceanic areas. Corrosion often results from direct action of atmospheric oxygen and moisture on metal, and additional moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly on ferrous alloys. Marine atmospheres contain chlorides such as salt particles or droplets of salt-saturated water. Since salt solutions are electrolytes, they corrosively attack aluminum and magnesium alloys, which are vulnerable to this type of environment. Therefore, the close proximity of the base to the sea will likely mean increased corrosion, and therefore some regular washing and covering up of the engines is not a bad idea from the operator. The whole aircraft being washed would be a bit better, but as this could be very time consuming, so just washing the sensitive landing gear might be a better compromise. The aircraft maintenance manual does not need to include a requirement to clean and cover up the aircraft, and it is common for every aircraft to be cleaned and covered up from time to time.",

Buckling is similar, but that indicates that significant compression has occurred, also a form of stress. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as turbulence, excessive vibration, or high loads during takeoff or landing. Over time, the stress can cause the material to weaken, which can lead to catastrophic failure if not addressed. The above image was apparently the result of a hard landing, which makes sense as it is around the main gear. Paint wear and bulges, impact dents and scratches, and faded paintwork may all be cosmetic issues that do not necessarily indicate stress on the airframe. While impact dents may cause localized stress, they do not necessarily indicate continuous stress on the entire airframe. It is important to regularly inspect the aircraft for signs of stress and take appropriate maintenance and repair actions to ensure safe and reliable operation.",

It is strictly forbidden to allow components to remain in service after the conclusion of their hard-time period. On-condition maintenance: refers to predictive maintenance that involves replacement or overhaul of components before a failure happens. Regular inspection of components gives maintenance teams records about the condition of each monitored part on an aircraft. This type of maintenance is based on monitoring of critical parameters of a component or piece of equipment and its replacement if a limit value is exceeded. The inspections are often done without completely tearing down each component, as indicators of wear or damage can be seen quickly, without excess work or aircraft down-time. The two maintenance processes are more or less useful for different components of an aircraft, dependent on their wear, risk of failure, etc. This means that an aircraft will often have hard-time maintenance tasks on some components, and on-condition maintenance tasks on other components. If the aircraft has a CRS (Certificate of Release to Service), it has been checked and is considered airworthy until a defect is found or the time/cycle limits given are reached.",

This question and the available options are quite ridiculous. We believe that the wing root fairings are probably most correct, as they cover the wing root, the highest stress point on the aircraft, and any deformation (due to high stress) would cause cracking, which may be visible on the fairing. However, it appears that most authorities are considering the \"wing root fairings\" to be incorrect (Spain and Poland confirmed). We think the next best answer is the \"aft pressure bulkhead\", but that is unconfirmed. Please send us any further exam feedback you have and let us know which authority you sat with, thank you! We obviously agree that a thorough inspection of the tail skid is important, as this is where evidence of tailstrikes would show, but we find the wording a little incongruous. We cannot inspect the aft pressure bulkhead itself - which is the area prone to stress due to pressurisation - as it is inside the aircraft skin, and the tail-skid itself is not naturally prone to stress (other than damage from tailstrikes). Furthermore, if the aft pressure bulkhead is considered correct, surely the forward pressure bulkhead must be correct also, in the fact that it cannot be inspected directly (as it is internal), but the outer skin can be inspected and is also prone to damage (birdstrikes). Therefore, we find it very unclear what the examiner is really asking here. Realistically, the exam wording makes quite a big difference to the question also. If the question does not include \"prone to stress\", then the argument is very different, as well as if different options are present. Neither the question nor the options have been verified as having the exact wording. We therefore need as much feedback for this one as we can get, thank you!

Moreover, a wing with negative or positive sweep may experience increased torsion compared to a rectangular wing, due to reduced stiffness.",

It should enable them to have adequate visibility in the forward, upward, and downward directions, while still being able to view all the instruments in the cockpit. To optimize the pilots' vision through the windows, certain aircraft are equipped with an eye reference position indicator. This indicator helps ensure that pilots' eye positions are optimized for the best possible view. In the absence of such indicators, aircraft often rely on a recommended view, which suggests how to position the pilots' line of sight to effectively see the glareshield. See some examples below: THE EYE REFERENCE POINT (figure 1) Fixed markers or other guides are installed at each pilot station to enable the pilots to position themselves in their seats for optimum combination of outside visibility and instrument scan. The Eye Reference Position standardises the visual attitude especially on approach and landing. THE EYE REFERENCE INDICATOR (figure 2) Some modern transport aircraft provide an eye reference indicator on the centre structure of the windshield. The indicator is a device that is fitted with 3 balls painted red or white. To achieve a correct seating position, pilots must align the red and white ball meaning that the white ball is hidden when in the correct position. OPTIMISED FIELD OF VIEW (figure 3) The cockpit is designed so that when the pilot has aligned themselves to the eye reference point; all of the instruments and displays on the front panel are in their field of view.

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen.

However many of the latest aircraft make use of modern composites for the empennage, cabin floor panels, flying control surfaces, engine cowlings and fairings. Each material is chosen for its particular properties with regard to fatigue strength, wear resistance, strength to weight ratio, fire resistance etc. COMPOSITE MATERIALS Composite materials are made of at least two elements to produce a material with properties that are different to those of the original elements. Nearly all composites consist of a bulk material, this is called the matrix and some form of reinforcement. This reinforcement is used mainly to increase the strength and stiffness of the matrix and is usually in a fibre form. ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - The ability to arrange the fibres to obtain directional properties consistent with the load - The ability to make complex shapes, since the material is not homogeneous - Weight savings - Resistance to corrosion - High specific strength - High specific stiffness DISADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS - They are quickly eroded by hail, sand, etc, so leading edges must be sheathed. - They are difficult to repair. - They can absorb moisture if the material is not correctly sealed. When comparing composite and metal structures, composite are: - Lighter: Composites can be up to 70 percent lighter than metal. - High strength-to-weight ratio: composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Carbon fiber weighs about 25% as much as steel and 70% as much as aluminum, and is much stronger and stiffer than both materials per weight. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. - Stronger: When increasing the strength of metal, it must be equally strong in all directions thickening the material and causing an increase in weight. Composites however can be engineered and designed to be strong in a specific direction while keeping it lightweight. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. - Corrosion Resistant: Composites resist weather damage and other harsh chemicals that would typically damage metal. - Nonconductive: Unlike steel, composites are nonconductive.",

To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. A heating element is added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

When an aircraft is in flight, the weight of the whole aircraft is being suspended by the wings. This means that the forces on the wings are enormous, and the wing roots in particular take a massive strain. These forces result in the wings flexing upwards during flight, as the outer sections of the wings are exerting force all through the wing spar, which causes it to bend slightly upwards. We do not want extremely stiff wings, as they would be brittle, and more likely to break. We are therefore happy for wings to flex, and it has become more common in newer aircraft to allow a lot of flex. Of course, there is only so much flex a material can handle though, so we can counteract it by changing an aircraft's design and how we operate it. By putting fuel in the wings, we weigh them down, to fight off some of the upwards flex from the lift. Most aircraft have their wings as their main tanks, so there is always some fuel in the wings to make this happen. This is also one of the reasons that many aircraft use up the fuel in their centre (fuselage) tanks first when possible, leaving the wing tanks full until the aircraft is a little lighter, and has less wing flex.",

            "explanation": "Note: this does delve into priciples of flight a little, but is still within AGK enough to be acceptable. Learning Objective 021.02.03.01.01: Describe the following types of design and explain their advantages and disadvantages: high-mounted wing; low-mounted wing; low- or mid-set tailplane; T-tail. There are two main places that an aircraft designer can mount a horizontal stabiliser at the rear of an aircraft. One place is \"low mounted\", at the base of the tail fin, and the other place is at the top of the fin, a \"T-tail\" due to its shape looking like the letter \"T\". The low-mounted position tends to be more common on large civilian transport aircraft these days, but both mounting locations have their own positive and negative factors. We will now talk about T-tail in comparison to low-mounted. T-tails have the horizontal stabiliser up and away from the turbulence created by the wing (during normal flight), which means the airflow over the tailplane is smoother. As the tailplane is therefore less affected by the downwash from the main wing, we can refer to this mounting position as \"stabilising\" (some questions in PoF ask about this). T-tails also make the fin and rudder more effective, as they act as a winglet for the fin and rudder, so a smaller rudder is required. However, all the forces produced by the horizontal stabiliser and the elevators must travel through the fin, meaning that the fin must be made much stronger (and therefore heavier) than if the stabiliser was mounted on the fuselage at the bottom. Also, a more practical consideration is that inspection is more difficult, especially when it comes to icing/de-icing. The final consideration for a T-tail is probably the most well known. The horizontal stabiliser may be out of the way of the turbulence from the wing during normal flight, but at high angles of attack, the tailplane will now be within the stalled region behind the wing, leading to a stall where no elevator control is possible, called a deep-stall. Deep-stalls can sometimes be unrecoverable. So let's go through the options. \"It increases manoeuvrability and responsiveness, it is a simpler design and therefore saves on production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. It has a stabilising effect on the aircraft, so decreases manoeuvrability. It is not simpler to design, requiring a very strong fin. It is obviously harder to inspect though, that bit is correct. \"It has a smoother airflow and therefore more predictable flight characteristics, but requires a stronger, heavier fin, and is susceptible to loss of effectiveness at high angles of attack.\" Correct, as mentioned above, the smoother airflow is correct, the stronger, heavier fin is also correct, and the last section which refers to a deep-stall at high angles of attack is correct as well for a T-tail. \"It allows for greater ground clearance when taxiing, it is a simpler design, therefore saving production cost, but it is harder to inspect after de-icing, and requires more ground handling equipment.\" Incorrect. Ground clearance is debatable, as an aircraft's wings are usually more of a concern for that. It is not simpler to design, as it requires a stronger fin. The last section about de-icing is correct, though. \"It has a smoother airflow, therefore more predictable flight characteristics, it has a wider operating range in pitch, but requires a stronger, therefore heavier fin.\" Incorrect. Smoother airflow, yes; but it certainly does not have a wider operating range in pitch, as it suffers from deep-stalls, becoming useless at high angles of attack. It does require a heavier fin though.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds. Glass is not quite as good for aircraft windshields, and even though there may be some form of glass within the many layers, the heating would not affect its properties to the same scale as the vinyl, and the glass has different properties anyway. If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance.",

Flutter is caused by the interaction of aerodynamic forces, inertia forces and the elastic properties of the surface or structure and can lead to the catastrophic failure of the structure. An aircraft that is in the cruise will be supported by its wings and they will be bent upwards. If the aircraft is subjected to a gust it will shake up and down with the wings flapping at a certain frequency. If the vibration is similar to that of the structure of the wing then it will begin to resonate. The resonance will amplify the flutter and may well lead to failure of the structure. Flutter must not occur within the normal flight operating envelope of the aircraft. Flutter can be prevented by mass balancing control surfaces to alter the moment of inertia of the surface and therefore the period of vibration (move the control surface C of G from behind the hinge to closer to the hinge). Poorly maintained aircraft, particularly those with excessive control surface backlash (play) or flexibility may mean that flutter could occur at speeds below the limit airspeed.",

This kind of fuselage would only be used on a light unpressurised aircraft suitable because of the easy construction. Cross section 2 => shows a circular fuselage which is the most suitable for a pressurised cabin as forces/pressure are distributed in the most even manner over the fuselage. Cross section 3 => depicts a double bubble sort of fuselage which is second most suitable because forces are almost distributed equally over the fuselage. These kinds are often used because of the space it can provide for passengers or cargo. Cross section 4 => represents largely one circle which is inturrupted by another shape. In this case, forces are distributed better than in a squared fuselage, however, it is not as strong as a double bubble construction. Correct sequence: 2, 3, 4, 1 (decreasing stability)",

            "explanation": "A wing is constantly subject to various forces; tension and compression are the main ones, but wings also experience torsion and shearing forces in some cases. When a aircraft is stationary on the ground, the wing is heavy, and is being pulled down due to gravity, wanting to droop downwards away from the fixed wing root. This means that the top surface of the wing will be under tension, as it is trying to be stretched, but the bottom surface would be under compression, as it is being squashed. This effect is increased with any increased weight of the wing, engines fitted or fuel inside the wings. The effect is reversed when flying in straight and level (1g) flight, where the wings are supending the heavy fuselage due to their ability to create lift. In this case the wings are flexing upwards away from the wing root, as can be seen very clearly on newer aircraft such as the B787 and A350. In this scenario, the upper surface of the wing is being squashed, so is under compression, where the bottom surface of the wing is under tension. This effect is increased when the lift increases (larger all-up weight, higher load factor, etc.) and also when the fuel in the wings is less, and there would be less weight resistance to the upwards flexing effect. The wing flex of different scenarios can be seen in the annex depicting a B52.",

Stringers and longerons prevent tension and compression stresses from bending the fuselage. The vertical structural members are referred to as bulkheads, rings and formers (frames). The bulkheads, rings and formers hold the stringers. All of these join together to form a rigid fuselage framework.",

            "explanation": "An airframe is the combination of the whole structure of an aircraft. It undergoes many forces during flight, the largest being the lifting force from the wings. Whatever the weight of the aircraft, the wings have to be able to suspend that amount of force with lift, and the vast majority of that force goes through the two wing roots. Hence, they are usually the strongest place on the entire aircraft. A very high stress scenario for the aircraft is pulling any sort of G-force, which requires increasing the load factor of the wings, and that means the lift of the wing has to increase. Large transport aircraft (CS-25) have a \"limit load factor\" of 2.5 G, and must be able to pull 150% of this (3.75 G) before complete structural failure occurs. This means that an aircraft will have to show during testing that the structure (mostly the wing spar and wing root) can withstand a lifting force of 3.75 times its own maximum take-off weight, which can be an incredible amount of force, before failing. Any G-force over the limit load factor is an \"overload\". An aircraft increases its loading during manoeuvres, so in banked turns (the greater the bank, the higher the wing loading), and any abrupt changes in direction, pitch, etc. Also, the loading increases in turbulence and any windshear. Aircraft stress obviously increases with weight, but the limiting load factor is set for the MTOW, so it can only get better as the aircraft gets lighter. VA is the manoeuvring speed, and if flying below VA, the aircraft will be unable to pull its limit load factor during a manoeuvre, as it will stall first, and therefore will not overload the airframe. Headwinds and tailwinds do not affect loading, as the aircraft just flies through the air mass it is in, and the head/tailwinds simply move the air mass forwards or backwards, increasing or decreasing groundspeed. As long as the winds do not change rapidly (windshear), this should not affect aircraft loading.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

            "explanation": "Ensuring accurate calculation of take-off performance data is crucial for reducing the chance of a tail strike during take-off. Knowing the correct rotation speed allows pilots to smoothly lift the aircraft's nose at the right moment. If the rotation speed is too high, it can lead to an excessively steep climb angle, increasing the likelihood of a tail strike as the aircraft leaves the ground. Conversely, if the rotation speed is too low, the aircraft may not achieve the desired pitch attitude for liftoff, potentially causing a tail strike as well. The two major threats for tail strikes to occur are during the landing flare/touchdown and during rotation on take-off. As many large jet transport aircraft are extended in length for larger passenger numbers, the long tail leaves very little tail margin during rotation, and factors such as crosswinds, gusty head/tailwinds and different weight and CG locations can lead to the potential for reduced tail clearance or tail strike. To mitigate this risk, pilots can choose to rotate at a slightly higher speed, if, for instance, they feel a gust just before rotation that might reduce their airspeed significantly. A higher airspeed means more airflow over the wings and therefore the aircraft will lift-off at a lower pitch angle, and the tail will therefore be further clear of the ground before reaching the tail strike angle. The pilot could also reduce the rate of rotation to further reduce the chance of tail strikes occurring (as might be done in an engine failure after V1 scenario), but this is not usually recommended in normal operation, and remember that both of these measures are not accounted for in the take-off performance calculation, so be careful not to run out of runway.",

Materials all have different properties, such as their strength, elasticity, resistance to corrosion, weight, cost, heat resistance, etc. The material that is chosen for the vast majority of aircraft construction is usually metal (composites are becoming more widely used in the sector, but metal is still the bulk of the industry). Different metals have different levels of strength, they are different to work with, and are used in different sections of the aircraft. For instance, the fuselage is usually made from an easily manufactured aluminium alloy, but sections of the hot engine are made from the very expensive, but incredibly heat resistant titanium. Alloys are a clever way of combining the different properties of two or more metals to make them better for the required usage. Now to answer this question. In general, metal has a high strength to weight ratio (in that it is strong but also light). The only better type of material for strength to weight ratio is composites. Composites such as carbon fibre, aramid (Kevlar), fibreglass, and plastic composites can be made incredibly strong, but far lighter than metals. Their fibres can also be aligned to create strength in particular directions, which is much harder to do in metal. The answer is not composites though, because they are very resistant to corrosion. Metal, however, is highly susceptible to corrosion, and it is a large part of what engineers check for and treat when they maintain an aircraft.",

            "explanation": "Since pressurisation forces are to be resisted by flight deck windows as well as the cabin structure, the windows need to be very strong. To achieve this, flight deck windows are constructed from several layers. Heating elements are added to the tough outer glass. There are two main benefits of heating: The first is icing resistance due to the increased temperature of the surface. Windshield heat controllers are generally capable of handling two primary functions: de-fog and de-ice. Cockpit side windows often do not feature window heating but are only equipped with defogging devices. The second is that the heated glass stays in a temperature range where it is less rigid. The heating elements usually heat the windows into this temperature range, switch off so they do not overheat, then switch back on again if the window is going to cool down too much, cycling like this throughout every flight. Window heating ensures the screen vinyl layer is kept elastic and resilient and better to absorb damage in case of a bird strike/hail. For this reason most, if not all, commercial aircraft with heated windshields will have a speed restriction below 10 000 ft if the windshield heat is inoperative, commonly that restriction is to be not above 250 KIAS below 10 000 ft.",

Strength-to-weight ratio is an important factor, as materials with a high strength-to-weight ratio are either stronger or lighter than other materials, both of which are useful for aviation. This is why metal and composites are so commonly used for aircraft construction, due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. As for the other options, susceptibility to corrosion is bad as it will weaken the airframe and potentially lead to failure.

Corrosion is unlikely to remove rivets on its own, as they are fused to the skin, and corrosion would have to be incredibly severe (and therefore noticeable) to start removing them completely. Hard landings and high manoeuvring loads can remove rivets, screws, and other fasteners through shearing forces, for example, if the \"improper maintenance or installation\" option is not present in the exam, this option should be chosen. With the options as they are, hard landing and manoeuvring loads are less likely to cause the complete loss of rivets than improper maintenance or installation.

The layering of different materials help to provide better impact resistance than one type of material only, combining the best features of all the materials. Aircraft windshields also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics (vinyl and acrylic) in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds.

The appropriate action to take if an operator notices corrosion on metal parts of their aircraft fleet is to repair, prime, and paint the damaged parts. This is important because corrosion can weaken the metal and compromise the structural integrity of the aircraft, which can be a safety hazard. Replacing the metal parts with plastic or composite materials may be an option, but it can be expensive and may not always be feasible. It is also important to note that different materials have different properties, and they may not be suitable for all applications. Washing the aircraft thoroughly after each flight may be important for general maintenance but may not prevent corrosion. A notable point is that washing the aircraft after every flight could cause some water based corrosion or rusting over time, so is not a good idea to fight corrosion. Painting over the corrosion to protect the area and add strength is not a recommended practice as it does not address the underlying corrosion issue and can lead to further damage. Therefore, the best course of action is to have the affected parts assessed by a qualified technician and have the corrosion removed and repaired, and then properly primed and painted to protect against further corrosion.",

There are many potential weak points in this, including windows, hatches, and doors. Therefore, the doors in a pressurised aeroplane have to be specifically designed to seal to the frame and not break or buckle under the forces of pressurisation. This is why pressurised aircraft often use \"plug type\" doors, where the door is larger than the frame, and is mounted inside of the frame, so the door is being pushed into the door frame by the force of air pressure, acting like a \"plug\" for the hole. These doors have to be opened inwards into the aircraft, and then are usually hinged in such a way that they can go back through the door frame sideways and remain outside the aircraft whilst open. This is done primarily to reduce the space taken up inside the aircraft by the door, which also helps during an evacuation. Therefore, the most correct answer is that the door can move inside and outside the aircraft. As for the other options; They are not always used in unpressurised aircraft, in fact I imagine that is quite rare. They do not need a pressure relief valve, they are supposed to hold quite high pressure loads, and there will be an over-pressure relief valve somewhere on the aircraft fuselage. They can be manually operated, and often are.",

The flight deck windshield is made of many different layers of materials, mostly plastics such as acrylic and vinyl, as well as some layers of toughened glass, to give it favourable properties such as high strength, good flexibility (for impact resistance) and a hard wearing outer coating, with good rain resistance. They also contain heating elements which have a couple of different jobs, their main job being to keep the plastics in a slightly softer state, where they are flexible enough to absorb and deflect impacts from objects like birds at very high speeds (it is therefore used on a continuous basis during the entire flight). If the heating was not present, then the windshield would become very brittle in the extreme cold of the upper airways and could break more easily upon impact. The secondary jobs of the heated windshield are de-fogging and de-icing, which are important in their own right, but are certainly a secondary consideration to the impact resistance. Another rationale for the constant operation of the window heating system is the mitigation of thermal gradients. When the window heating system is activated, it ensures that the window pane remains at a consistent temperature throughout the entirety of the flight.",

As for the other options: Engine driven pumps require the engines to be on, and that would be very hazardous for ground crew trying to open the cargo doors, so is not feasible. A ram air turbine is a small wind turbine that drops from the underside of an aircraft to provide power/hydraulic pressure to important controls in flight. It is not used on the ground, nor would it be useful without any airflow through it. A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc.",

The RAT generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump. Consequently, more power is generated when the aircraft is operating at a higher speed and less is generated when operating at lower speeds.",

They also act as a lubricating medium, thereby reducing the friction between moving parts and carrying away some of the heat. Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. In aviation, mainly mineral or synthetic based oil are used: DTD 585: a refined mineral based oil. Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system and maintain the seals according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Ideal properties of a hydraulic fluid: Low compressibility: to ensure instantaneous operation; Good lubrication and anti-corrision properties: hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant for the pumps, actuators and motors within the system; High flash point and low flammability: fluid ignition should not occur at the normal operating temperatures of the surrounding components; Low volatility: be resistant to evaporation; Adequate viscosity: the fluid used must flow easily at very low temperatures but must also maintain adequate viscosity at high temperatures. The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability.",

Whilst this is an awful question, which pilots would usually have no business dealing with, it can still be worked out with the normal knowledge from the syllabus. A hydraulic accumulator is a device used to store hydraulic pressure, for the purposes of smoothing out hydraulic pressure changes, and storing the pressure in case there is a loss of hydraulic pump, so a finite amount of pressure remains for further uses. It works by compressing nitrogen inside the accumulator with the force of the hydraulic fluid, and then the high pressure nitrogen is where the energy is stored. There are a few different ways to do this, via diaphragm, with a moving piston between the fluid and the nitrogen, and with no separation at all, just gravity. These are the types of gas charged accumulators, but there are also spring accumulators and even weighted accumulators that can be used. We do not normally look into these though. If an accumulator was mounted horizontally, the gravity option would not keep the fluid in the lines, so would not work. Therefore only a diaphragm or (more likely) a moving piston would be used in this orientation. This should mean that there is no cross-contamination of nitrogen and hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid stays on one side of the piston/diaphragm, the nitrogen stays on the other side. If, as in this scenario, there is an amount of hydraulic fluid leaving the nitrogen release valve, then there must have been some sort of leak between the two, for hydraulic fluid to enter the nitrogen section.",

In this case, hydraulic pressure is a gauge pressure, and is therefore measured against atmospheric pressure. We can also work this out by thinking about what happens when you de-pressurise a hydraulic system completely. The hydraulic pressure will read 0 PSI, as the fluid is exerting the same amount of pressure on its surroundings as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 PSI greater than a vacuum (i.e. its absolute pressure is 14.7 PSI, or 1013 hPa). For instance, manifold pressure gauges read out MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure), so show the absolute ambient pressure when the engine is off. Other systems rarely read out absolute pressure.",

This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. Note: The wording is unconfirmed on this question as it came from limited feedback, but we don't expect any significant differences to the real exam, certainly nothing that will change the answer.",

The harder the brake pedal is pushed, the more friction the brakes make. This is known as a \"passive\" hydraulic system, as it does not have any other source of hydraulic pressure like a hydraulic pump. The energy comes only from the person pressing the brake pedal(s). An active hydraulic system is used for braking (and many other things) on large aircraft, where a system is constantly pressurised and the brakes are operated by action on the brake pedals effectively turning a valve to allow more or less of that pressure to work on the brakes. This allows much stronger braking action than a human could possibly produce.",

Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, petroleum-based and phosphate ester-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids.

On its own it is not useful as it has varying pressure output, which could perhaps overpressure a system or burn out the pump motor, etc., so it has to be combined with an automatic cut-out valve (ACOV) which turns this constant voulme output into a constant pressure supply into a system. There are quite a few different ways of creating a constant delivery pump, primarily for the ATPLs we usually think of a gear style pump for this purpose, but for context we have attached an image that shows some possible pump designs. Bear in mind that constant pressure pumps have less options for how they can be constructed (usually an axial piston pump design with a control piston).",

On some large aircraft (such as the Airbus A320 family), the cargo doors are very heavy and are therefore lifted by hydraulics. They are only opened and closed on the ground, of course, so primarily this will be done with the electric hydraulic pumps providing the pressure to the system. However, if the electric hydraulic pumps are not operating (electric supply issues or pumps INOP), then the cargo doors can be opened and closed using a hand pump to provide the necessary pressure to the hydraulics. As for the other options: A hydraulic accumulator would likely still have some pressure in it during most ground operations, but it is not what you would use to operate the cargo doors, as it would quickly run out of pressure and is needed for the parking brakes in some aircraft, etc. Power transfer units are used to transfer hydraulic pressure (not fluid) from one system to another, but one system has to be pressurised for this to work, and that is not the case in this scenario. External hydraulic power units do not exist for this kind of scenario. That is a fake option, playing on the fact that external air carts and external ground power units can feed the aircraft pneumatic systems and electrical systems, but not hydraulics.",

If this is lost, there is an automatic switchover to Alternate Brakes powered by the center system. In addition to supply system redundancy, the brake accumulator is also an emergency source of power for the brakes in many power brake systems.

Only the simplest hydraulic systems, such as the brake circuit on a light aircraft, are powered by human effort. All advanced hydraulic systems use some form of pump to increase hydraulic pressure and facilitate fluid flow under pressure. Hydraulic systems can be classified as either: Low-pressure systems: Typically operating up to 2000 PSI. High-pressure systems: Typically operating at 3000 PSI, though some aircraft may use hydraulic pressures of 4000 to 5000 PSI. High pressure reduces fluid volume and component mass. However, even at higher pressures, hydraulic fluid is considered incompressible. Very high pressures can induce shear stresses in the fluid, leading to adverse hydraulic effects. Additionally, there is a slightly increased risk of fluid leaks at joints in the lines. Properties High Pressure Low Pressure Weight (similar size aircraft) Lighter due to smaller actuators Higher Force Able to apply extremely large forces Unable to apply larger forces Construction Complex Simple Pressure Yes No",

Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, mineral-based and synthetic-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system as breakdown of the seals is likely which will cause fluid leakage.",

            "explanation": "A \"demand pump\" is actually an axial piston \"constant pressure\" hydraulic pump. This is the only pump that has a variable swash plate. This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It runs at a constant RPM and modulates its volumetric flow output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure. In terms of hydraulic pressures, most large transport aircraft have hydraulic pressures in the range of 3000 - 5000 psi as this is a good amount to power heavy control surfaces and landing gear systems, etc. Larger aircraft tend to have higher pressures in general, and the Airbus A380 runs hydraulic pressures of 5000 psi, whereas Boeing 737s run at 3000 psi.",

Hydraulic fluids should be handled with care as they are considered to be a skin and eye irritant. In aviation, mainly mineral or synthetic based oil are used: DTD 585: a refined mineral based oil. Colour - red. Used with synthetic rubber seals. SKYDROL: a phosphate ester based oil (synthetic). Colour - purple or green, depending on type. Used with synthetic rubber seals. Is fire resistant and less prone to cavitation because of its higher boiling point. Due to the difference in composition, mineral-based and synthetic-based fluids will not mix; neither are the seals for any one fluid usable with or tolerant of any of the other fluids. Should an aircraft hydraulic system be serviced with the wrong type fluid, immediately drain and flush the system as breakdown of the seals is likely which will cause fluid leakage.",

The ideal hydraulic fluid will have a very low freezing point and a very high boiling point. Thermal stability. Hydraulic fluids are also \"irritating to skin and eyes\" according to the Learning Objectives. This is another reason that we believe that the corrosion answer is most correct. The internal workings of the hydraulic system will be metal, perhaps with special coatings, but certainly not paint. The aircraft is covered with paint though, and anyone who has carelessly bled brakes before will know that brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) is corrosive to paintwork. Whether it will harm the bodywork underneath would depend on the material and the individual fluid. Whilst it should have good anti-corrosion properties, who knows how good those are, especially against different materials. Important Note: We have received conflicting feedback about this question. Any further exam feedback would therefore be very useful to help us verify this question, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or placed in the comments.

This is the best type of hydraulic pump for most aircraft hydraulic systems. It modulates its volumetric output to provide constant pressure to the system, and therefore needs no automatic cut-out valve like a constant delivery pump would. This is why it is called a \"demand pump\", it regulates its output based on the demand. It works the same way as a constant delivery pump for the most part. The inlet flow from the reservoir enters the pistons when they are furthest away, then the drive shaft spins the swash plate round so the pistons push against the fluid and this provides pressure to the hydraulic system through the outlet tube. The control piston senses the pressure in the system and adjusts the angle of the swash plate to either increase or decrease the amount of \"pushing\" the pistons do, thereby keeping the system pressure constant. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 1 shows the pump at maximum stroke and figure 2 shows the pump at minimum stroke, when the system is already at the correct pressure.",

The gas side of the accumulator is charged to a predetermined pressure with air or nitrogen. As the accumulator is fitted and the hydraulic pressure in the system builds up, the gas in the accumulator will be compressed until fluid and gas pressures equalise at normal system pressure. That is why the accumulator gauge will read the same as the hydraulic system is pressurised to. The correct answer mentions that it provides \"hydraulic power\" in the event of a system failure or emergency, which is correct, as the gas is compressed to store energy which keeps the fluid pressurised in order to provide power onto hydraulic actuators if the pumps fail.

The cylinder and the drive-shaft are coaxial and rotate taking the pistons which can move up and down in the cylinder. The pistons are a connected to shoes to the non-rotating yoke or swash plate. The angle of the swash-plate and thus the piston stroke is varied by the position of the control piston. This piston is controlled by the outlet pressure on one side of it and a spring on the other. If the pump is stationary there will be no hydraulic pressure and so the spring will push the control piston to the right and the swash-plate angle will be maximum. As the pump begins to rotate the pistons will start moving up and down because of the angle of the swash-plate. If the required operating pressure is reached, the control piston will be pushed back to the left causing the swash-plate to be almost vertical and therefore the pistons’ stroke will be minimal. This will become more clear if you have a look at the attached pictures. The first picture will give an overview of how this constant pressure pump looks. Figure 2 shows the pump at maximum stroke and picture 3 shows the pump at minimum stroke.",

Larger aircraft with multiple main gear wheels often mount the main landing gear on bogie beams, which are excellent for absorbing direct impacts during landing, but can suffer from very high sideways loads during tight turns whilst taxiing. These sideways loads also put a lot of sideways stress on the tyres, which can only rotate forwards and backwards, of course, so will get unnecessarily \"scrubbed\" during tight turns. This effect can be reduced somewhat by giving the main gear bogie beams a small amount of available steering angle, which is only used in slow speed tight turns, turning the opposite direction of the nose wheel to turn sideways forces into longitudinal forces on the main gear assemblies, thereby reducing stress on the torsional links and reducing tyre abrasion.

INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will result in a longer stopping distance on dry runways only. INCORRECT: braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never ensure the required stopping distance – take-off has to be avoided. INCORRECT, while manual braking significantly increases the braking distance (50%) this doesn’t mean the stopping distance available isn’t long enough. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. Manual braking When the anti-skid is inoperative the braking distance will almost always be longer in any case, regardless of runway condition. Manual braking will never be as consistent and efficient as the auto-brake with anti-skid would.",

The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper.

Please do let us know if you see this question in the real exam and anything you can remember about it, thank you. Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.06: Describe the various protection devices to avoid inadvertent gear retraction on the ground and explain the implications of taking off with one or more protection devices in place: ground lock (pins); protection devices in the gear retraction mechanism. Let's go through the options: \"Insert the ground lock pins.\" Correct. Ground lock pins are for the landing gear when an aircraft has a retractable undercarriage, and they slot into the gear downlock system to make sure that the gear cannot retract whilst on the ground, no matter what happens to the hydraulics or external conditions. For long term storage, they must be fitted. They are part of the pilot's checks before flight, also, as leaving them in will not allow the landing gear to be raised. \"Leave the parking brakes on.\" Incorrect. The parking brakes of an aircraft are just sealed off hydraulic fluid, and leaving them on for extended periods of time can lead to seizing of the brakes, or potentially a leak of the hydraulic fluid through small imperfections in the system, allowing the brakes to gradually release. Aircraft are chocked or tied down for long term storage. \"Leave the flaps in the extended position to release the hydraulic pressure.\" Incorrect. Flaps should be up for long term storage, to avoid wind damage, damage to the mechanism, keep birds from nesting in the flap tracks, etc. The hydraulic pressure has nothing to do with it. \"Always park the aircraft facing upwind.\" Whilst this is best practice, it cannot always be done, and even if you park into wind one day, for long periods of parking, the wind will change and the aircraft will no longer be into wind all the time.",

            "explanation": "Refer to the figure Large aircraft have Oleo-Struts as shock absorbers, an example in the picture attached. An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

Rudder pedal nose wheel steering offers a smaller maximum deflection of the nose wheel as tiller nose wheel steering. Correct, tiller nose wheel steering has a deflection up to 78 degrees where rudder pedal steering has a maximum of 7 degrees. When performing a rudder check during taxiing there is no need for additional pilot action to avoid deflection of the nose wheel. Incorrect, there is a need for additional pilot action to avoid deflection of the nose wheel.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. Such system allows the landing gear to just drop naturally under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversible operation. In order to activate this system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through a mechanical linkage. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. The weight of the gear will also push the doors open. The gears will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical downlocks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. There are other systems available for emergency gear extension, such as electrical or pneumatic, but gravity free-fall is so much more common due to its simplicity and lack of potential failure points. It is often aided by pneumatic pressure or a similar system to release the uplocks though.",

As previously discussed, RTO does NOT provide a predetermined fixed braking force. Instead, it always ensures the maximum available braking power. “Manual braking is the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft.” INCORRECT. As discussed, the most efficient way to decelerate the aircraft is by using the autobrakes which will reduce the pilot’s workload and allow them to focus on other tasks, i.e. directional control. “Without pilot input, the RTO mode will automatically brake the aircraft to a full stop.” This one is ambiguous and unfortunately, we have to assume that the pilot has not yet taken the decision to abort take off – meaning that he hasn’t retarded the power levers. As you know, in order to activate the RTO mode, some conditions must be met - One of those conditions is that the pilot has to bring the power levers to the idle position. Only then the RTO will brake the aircraft to a full stop. Even though, this statement isn’t completely wrong, it isn’t completely accurate either.",

An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air, especially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy.",

This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

On the majority of cars, this means the force you apply to the brake pedal pressurises the brake fluid (hydraulic fluid), and this pressure is used to push a piston (actuator) to force brake pads (stators) into brake discs (rotors) connected to each wheel. The harder you push the pedal, the harder the brake pads contact the discs, the more friction is caused, and the harder you decelerate. This is a manual braking system. In light aircraft, the same system is present, but in large aircraft, many thousands of times more braking force is needed, requiring large multi-disk brakes on many more wheels, and your feet are just not able to provide enough force to apply these brakes, no matter how much you go to the gym. This means that the brakes run off the normal hydraulic system, and your feet (or the autobrake - if fitted) are now simply moving a valve to provide more or less hydraulic pressure to the brake actuators. This means that, given large aircraft hydraulic systems can run from 3000 to 5000 psi, these can provide much more braking force, and the power comes from hydraulic pumps, not your feet. PARKING BRAKES Parking brakes operate the same in almost all aircraft, no matter whether you are using manual brakes or a hydraulically assisted system. They use a simple shut-off valve upstream of the brake actuators, and whilst the brakes are being applied, with the pads pushed into the disks, the valve is closed to trap that hydraulic pressure inside the braking system and keep those wheels stopped. The only difference is how much pressure is trapped within the brakes when you set it on. In a light aircraft, you need to push the brakes hard enough when setting the parking brake, or they might not be fully set on. Most large aircraft will not let you make this mistake. If you do leave parking brakes set on for a long time, small leaks within the system may slowly allow the pressure to drop and the brakes might slowly release, or the brakes could go the other way and seize in place, so aircraft should not have them set for too long, and instead chocks and tie-downs should be used to secure aircraft for long periods.",

The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. This is not the case for the RTO mode though. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated. This mode uses maximum braking, which will either be limited by the anti-skid system on poor traction surfaces, tyre limitations, or by the maximum brake pressure. The use of reverse thrust is beneficial for stopping distance, but in RTO mode the autobrake will continue to apply maximum braking until disarmed or stopped, irrespective of the deceleration rate. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. Otherwise, the autobrake will stop the aircraft completely.",

The most common kinds you will see are the hand crank, hand pump hydraulic, free fall and pressurized nitrogen bottle systems. These systems are designed for emergency gear extension - not retraction. Failure of gear to retract is not an emergency unless it retracts partially and cannot be extended again A hand crank system is often found on aeroplanes with electric gear systems. The crank is employed to turn the gears that operate the actuators manually instead of through the electric motor. If you fly an aeroplane with a hydraulic system, you might use a hydraulic hand pump system to extend the gear when the primary pump fails. You do so by supplying the necessary hydraulic fluid pressure to the actuator cylinders by pumping a hand pump. A freefall system is another method of gear extension used on aeroplanes that have hydraulic gear systems. A control lever is used to open a valve that releases the system pressure. Hydraulic pressure equalizes on both sides of the gear actuators and allow the landing gear to fall into position through the force of gravity and aerodynamic loads. In the pressurized nitrogen bottle system, the nitrogen is not directly used to actuate the landing gear actuators or brake units but, instead, it applies the pressurized nitrogen to move hydraulic fluid to the actuator.",

This pin is inserted into the landing gear mechanism during ground operations, typically as part of the aircraft's parking procedures, maintenance, or pre-flight checks. The primary function of the landing gear anti-retract pin is to prevent the landing gear from retracting while the aircraft is on the ground.

            "explanation": "“In the RTO mode the auto-brake system provides a fixed level of deceleration.” INCORRECT. If certain conditions are met, the RTO autobrake setting commands maximum braking pressure/power. Therefore, it does not provide a predetermined fixed braking force. “Manual braking is always the best stopping technique for a rejected take-off.” INCORRECT. Especially when conditions are less than ideal (shorter and wet runways), or rejected take off, many flight crews prefer to use the autobrake rather than use manual braking, and devote their attention to the use of rudder for directional control => “the machine does the braking and I maintain directional control”. Autobrake reduces pilots’ workload and allows them to channel their attention to other important duties. Furthermore, with autobrake, the human’s reaction time on pressing the brakes is eliminated – therefore, it is more efficient. “When the RTO mode is armed, the system will operate at any speed when the take-off is aborted.” INCORRECT. The wheel speed must be at least (around) 90 kts and the thrust levers must be moved to idle position. In case of an aborted take off below wheel speed of 90 kts, the autobrake system will not activate. “Without pilot interference an auto-brake system continues to operate until standstill.” CORRECT. Unless the system is disarmed by flight crew pressing the pushbutton switch or applying enough deflection to at least one brake pedal – the autobrake will bring the aircraft to a complete stop.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "Anti-skid systems have several functions, but most importantly, they help braking by maintaining an optimum wheel-slip value. Anti-skid system operations are based on tachometers called wheel speed sensors that measure the rotation speed of each wheel. The tachometers are connected to a computer called anti-skid unit (ASU). The ASU, by comparing the aircraft ground speed as a reference with precise wheel RPM measurements from tachometers, determines the slip ratio required for optimum braking. When a wheel begins to turn too slowly, brake pressure to this wheel is reduced. Operative anti-skid results in shorter landing distances, but also enhances take-off performance by reducing the accelerate-stop distance. In addition to the main optimised braking function, anti-skid systems offer other functions including: The ASU prevents brake application before touchdown on landing. It will prevent any brake pressure even if brake pedals are pressed before touchdown to allow the stationary wheels to spin-up to speed on contact. Only after spin-up does the ASU allow brake preassure application. The ASU protects against the locking of any wheel during the braking process by avoiding excessive wheel-slip values. The ASU protects against the effects of hydroplanning.",

            "explanation": "Brakes on a car are operated by the driver pushing on the brake pedal, which uses a piston to squeeze hydraulic fluid into the brake lines, which then applies a force on the brake pads, pressing the pads onto the spinning disks to create friction, which gives braking action. This is, of course, a hydraulic system. Hydraulic systems are an excellent way to transfer forces around a vehicle like a car or an aircraft. The main benefit of hydraulics is that the fluid is not compressible, so the force from the brake pedal piston is immediately (and completely) transferred onto the brake pads. This applies to an aircraft as well, as the only difference is that large aircraft brakes use multiple brake pads (stators) and brake disks (rotors), and the braking systems are usually supplemented by the high pressure hydraulic systems that run the rest of the aircraft's systems to gain higher forces than just the pilot's feet can produce. The emergency braking system that is mentioned in this question is to be used in the case of a loss of hydraulic pressure, and extra pressure can be gained by firing a single burst of high pressure gas into the brake lines, which then allow the brakes to be used (not nicely, but better than nothing). Because of the gas (most likely Nitrogen to reduce fire risk) now inside the hydraulic brake lines, the force applied to the pedals is not going to be completely applied to the brakes, as some of the pressure is absorbed by the compression of the gas in the lines. This makes the brakes feel \"soft\" or \"spongy\" underfoot, and not nearly as reactive or sensitive. After this is used, the brake lines will have to be bled again to remove the remaining air in the system, and replace it completely with hydraulic fluid. The gas canister will be replaced for emergency brake system use in the future. Mention of the anti-skid system is there to throw you off. Anti-skid improves braking by stopping the wheels from locking up, so actually increases brake temperature (or does not affect it, depending on the conditions).",

Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications — one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.08: Describe the sequence for emergency gear extension: unlocking; operating; down-locking. All aircraft are different in their emergency gear extension, but on the whole, the concept is the same. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. Many system allows the landing gear to essentially \"free fall\" under the influence of gravity from their retracted and up-locked position to an extended and down-locked position. This is usually a one-time non-reversable operation. We are assuming that \"activating the uplocks\" in this sense refers to the mechanical unlocking process of the gear uplocks. This is usually a cable that is pulled from the flight deck by some means, which overcomes the spring tension on the uplock, releasing the gear (and/or gear doors) to extend by gravity. Another consideration is that of the hydraulic system, as usually landing gear is held up during flight by a combination of the mechanical up-locks and the hydraulic pressure being sealed off within the actuators. To release the gear for free fall, the correct sequence of actions would usually be: Release the hydraulic cut-off valve holding the hydraulic pressure (not the selector valves, they are different) Release the locks holding the undercarriage doors (if fitted). Release the mechanical uplocks holding the gear up. One or all of these items may have to be performed manually, using mechanical pulley systems. Compressed gas can also be fired for the purposes of releasing mechanical up-locks.",

AUTOBRAKE SYSTEM The autobrake system uses hydraulic system pressure to provide maximum braking in the event of a rejected take-off and automatic braking at preselected deceleration rates immediately after touchdown on landing. REJECTED TAKEOFF (RTO) The RTO mode can be selected (armed) only when on the ground. The RTO mode will engage when a few conditions are met, such as being above 88kts and setting the thrust levers to idle (B737). The airbus A320 doesn't have a named RTO mode, but MAX is only ever used for RTOs and it engages when the ground spoilers deploy, which is at or above 72 kt and with thrust levers set to idle. They are all very similar systems, with small variations. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually. It does not provide a constant rate of deceleration as the landing autobrake modes attempt to do. You could argue that it \"applies the anti-skid maximum braking\" as anti-skid would reduce the brake pressure if the traction is not good enough, but this is not mentioned and we would consider this a less correct answer, particularly after looking at the learning objectives and previous questions.",

The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). Autobrakes have quite a simple logic system, depending on their mode of operation, they use the wheel brakes to slow down the aircraft at a pre-determined, constant rate of deceleration (you can think of it as a constant G-force, or a constant amount of knots lost per second). This is independent on the weight of the aircraft, and the only thing that can usually hamper this is any lack of traction on the runway (wet, ice, etc.). This standard deceleration rate means that the use of any other deceleration methods will simply take some of the energy away from the brakes, making their job easier. The autobrake system does not care how easy the braking is though, it is very set on gaining a constant rate of deceleration, so applying reverse thrust would not change the rate of deceleration, it would just make the brakes cooler at the end of the landing, as they have worked less hard. The way the autobrake system controls this is by modulating the brake pressure, this is the hydraulic pressure which pushes the brake stators into the rotors. To make the brakes work less hard, the autobrake system reduces the brake pressure.",

If the take-off is rejected after reaching a wheel speed of 90 knots, maximum braking is applied automatically when the forward thrust levers are retarded to IDLE. Please note that the above example is true for the Boeing 737. The Rejected Take-off Mode (RTO) varies from one aircraft type to another, however the concept remains the same. The autobrake applies maximum braking and it can be disconnected at any time by the pilot, who can then apply brakes manually.",

As bad as the wording in this question is, the first part is simple. In all aircraft, the landing gear is an active system, in that it requires a power source to function, in this case it is hydraulic pressure that powers it. The landing gear in some aircraft can be lowered passively (gravity extension), but cannot be raised passively. So now for the second part of the question. The power for the hydraulic system in all large aircraft comes from engine driven pumps. These pumps are driven by the auxiliary gearbox connected to one of the engine shafts. Electric hydraulic pumps are also present, and provide the same amount of pressure, but have a much lower displacement as they are much smaller, weaker pumps. Therefore, when landing gear is raised, the vast majority of the load is placed on the engine driven pumps, and is therefore fed by power from the auxiliary gearbox.",

While this question may be type-specific, the learning objectives offer limited room for discussion as you can read above. Automatic Braking (Autobrake) systems offer two modes of operation: Landing Mode Rejected Take-Off (RTO) Mode In Landing Mode (1, 2, 3, MAX), calibrated pressure is automatically applied to the brakes upon touchdown, regardless of pilot input. This system adjusts brake pressure to counteract aircraft drag, thrust reversers, and spoilers, maintaining the chosen deceleration level for modes 1, 2 and 3 and maximum braking for MAX. The Rejected Take-Off (RTO) setting instructs the autobrake system to apply full pressure to the wheel brakes, bringing the aircraft to a stop. Activation of RTO mode occurs when a rejected takeoff is initiated by the pilot at a groundspeed exceeding 88 knots. Note: On a Boeing 737, the 1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions control the autobrake system during landing, modulating brake pressure to achieve specified deceleration rates until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. Regarding other options, the use of reverse thrust and autobrake is not mutually exclusive - Flight crews can employ reverse thrust in conjunction with autobrake for maximum deceleration. Although the autobrake system is designed to facilitate a smooth landing rollout and keep the aircraft on the runway, pilots must always conduct calculations to ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the available landing distance.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. Tread separation is a form of damage to the outer layer of the tyre, which is not always easily visible, where the rubber tread becomes removed from the potentially damaged inner layers of the tyre. Not only does it heavily reduce traction, but it also can cause bad vibrations and extreme damage to the uncovered inner sections of the tyre, most likely ending in a \"blow-out\" where the tyre bursts completely.",

The torsion link provides that mechanical connection between the inner and the outer cylinder (the wheel and the aircraft) in only one direction, preventing sideways movement, whilst still allowing shock absorption by the oleo in the up and down direction, as it moves in and out due to its \"scissor link\" design. The torsion link does carry lots of stress, therefore, when the aircraft wants to turn and the wheel does not. For example, a main wheel (without steering capability) going round a tight corner where the aircraft wants to twist sideways but the wheel does not.

            "explanation": "Pre-flight inspections must confirm whether the condition of the tyre is suitable for operation. Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Note: If you find cuts in the tire, it’s important to make sure that they haven’t cut into the ply of the tire. Any deep cuts extending more than half the width of a rib and deeper than 50 percent of the remaining tread depth are indications for tire replacement. In this case, we believe the examiner is referring to superficial cuts which would make the tyre still airworthy. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. \"5. Oil contamination on the tyre surface\" Correct. Oil contamination (i.e. brake oil, fuel, tar oil, solvents, chemicals) can degrade the rubber of the tire. Typically, the standard approach involves cleaning the tire with Isopropyl Alcohol. However, if the tire becomes sticky, it becomes necessary to replace the wheel. Hydrocarbons have a detrimental effect on rubber, causing it to lose its essential properties, thereby reducing tire performance.",

During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides the capability to select a fixed landing distance” INCORRECT. Only a few aircraft do that, I believe the A350 and A380 – where you can actually go into the computer and say “this is the runway we are landing on, and I actually want to vacate at this specific exit” because it has the runway in the database and all the different taxiways off the runway and, therefore, you can use the autobrake and select to vacate at a certain exit and it will make sure you have the right speed to vacate => but that is not the majority of the aeroplanes. Ultimately, it is not very practical because there are a lot of different factors. On most aircrafts, it just provides a fixed deceleration rate but not a fixed landing distance (seen it is subjected to wind as well). You can never say it will precisely take this xxx amount of distance. Hopefully, this makes sense. “The achievable deceleration levels of full manual braking and the auto-brake RTO mode are the same” CORRECT. So if you press on the pedals as hard as you possibly can, it’s going to give you a maximum deceleration rate and it will also ensure that the wheels don’t lock up – which is exactly the same as autobrake max/RTO. If you look at the pushbutton, it says MAX - maximum amount of braking so it is the same as if you push on the pedals as hard as you can. (Don’t forget that you’ve got antiskid which works in conjunction with autobrake as well) => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. But the thing with the autobrake is that, as soon as the pilot decides to reject the take off and closes the thrust levers, then the maximum braking pressure gets applied immediately. Whereas, if you were to take off without autobrake, and then decided to abort the take-off, you’d first think about “right, I have got to close the thrust levers” and then you’ve got to think to press on the brake pedals => so, there’s obviously an element of delay in that. And that is why the stopping distance in the event of a manual rejected take off would be greater, even though the brake pressure on the brakes, would be exactly the same under both circumstances. Hopefully that kind of makes sense. Video Explanation:",

All the tire needs is a new tread. Airplane tires can be expensive: there is no logical reason to scrap a tire for an aircraft when it can be safely and economically reconditioned with a new tread. This is why retreading has been standard practice in the aviation industry for decades. The maximum retread level for the part number is set only after extensive testing and analysis. Some airplane tyres can be safely retreaded up to seven or more times, but there is always a limit and the limit is always set with an abundance of caution. The retread process is easy to understand. A worn tyre is removed from an aircraft. It is sent back to a retreading firm, often a manufacturer of airplane tires. When the firm receives a tire for retreading it is carefully inspected to ensure that it is safe and economical to retread. The tyre is scrapped if technicians consider there to be doubt about its airworthiness.",

Conventional brake discs are typically fashioned from steel, boasting durability, cost-efficiency, and consistent braking performance. Carbon is also harnessed in brake assembly due to its superior heat absorption and dissipation characteristics. Carbon brakes exhibit notably lighter weight compared to their steel counterparts.

Once activated, nitrogen pressure from the emergency air bottle is released through a shuttle valve to the extend side of the landing gear actuators, extending the gear towards the down and locked position. Once the gear has fully extended, the down locks inside the actuators will engage and the down and locked micro switches will be energised causing the three green down and locked lights to illuminate.

A skid not corrected can quickly lead to a tire blowout, possible damage to the aircraft, and control of the aircraft may be lost. One of the important issues to realize is that the anti-skid system greatly increases the effectiveness of braking. In very simplified terms, the anti-skid system provides the greatest possible brake pressure while not allowing the wheels to lock due to an excessive brake pressure being applied. Without the anti-skid system (manual braking) the braking effectiveness is reduced. \"The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed to provide a slip ratio for maximum braking performance.\" Correct. These systems use a computer that, during ground movement when braking, which constantly compares the measured values of individual wheels (actual rotational speed) with the desired optimum parameters, providing a slip ratio for maximum braking performance. \"If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will be able to achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with anti-skid.\" Incorrect. A pilot will never reach the same performance as a properly functioning anti-skid system. The anti-skid system senses when a brake starts to skid and will reduce braking pressure to avoid the wheels from skidding, a pilot won’t come close to the same performance.",

During taxi we only ever use manual braking, therefore, the reference to the use of autobrake during taxi does not make sense. “On most aeroplanes the auto-brake system provides a constant deceleration during landing on a dry runway. (ignoring possible transition effects when the system begins to function)” CORRECT. The autobrake system varies the brake pressure to achieve a deceleration rate (about 1.7 m/sec2 on the A320 in low autobrake mode). So, when you select “low” autobrake mode in flight, on the landing roll out – it varies the brake pressure to achieve that deceleration rate always. If it is a contaminated runway and it can’t achieve that rate, fundamentally, it will just achieve what it can achieve. “When a low auto-brake setting is used during landing use of reverse will not influence the brake temperature.” INCORRECT. It obviously will, the autobrake varies the brake pressure to achieve a constant deceleration, so therefore, if you’re using thrust reversers, some of that energy (to dissipate speed to achieve a certain deceleration rate) is being supplied by the use of thrust reversers – therefore, they reduce the amount of brake pressure which has to be applied on the brakes => brake temperature will reduce as a result of using reversers. “When the auto-brake system is inoperative, in general take-off is not allowed, because maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in the RTO mode.” INCORRECT. I would say that this is a bit type specific. However, saying that the maximum manual braking does not achieve the same deceleration as the auto-brake system in RTO IS NOT CORRECT. => Fundamentally, if autobrake is in rejected take off RTO mode and you reject the take off => then the braking will be maximum possible braking, which is exactly the same as if you press on the pedals maximum. The same amount of pressure is accomplished, the only benefit of autobrake is that the braking happens immediately, you do not have to wait for a pilot to respond to it. And, therefore, the braking distance without an autobrake is longer => because of the reaction time. BOTTOM LINE: same deceleration is accomplished, stopping distance in manual braking is greater due to the reaction time.",

The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 021.04.01.02.09: Describe some methods for emergency gear extension including: gravity/free fall; air or nitrogen pressure; manually/mechanically. The emergency extension system lowers the landing gear if the main hydraulic system fails. There are numerous ways in which this can be done depending on the size and complexity of the aircraft. A very common way of extending the landing gear in case of emergency is by gravity free fall. This is common for large aircraft as their gear are very heavy. Unfortunately, in light aircraft, the gear components are not as heavy, so can get jammed in place with not very much force. This includes the \"blowdown\" system using compressed gasses. The action of emergency gear extension is often a one-way movement, and cannot be reversed. In order to activate the system, the aircraft will have an emergency release handle in the cockpit which connects to the gear up locks through one of the following systems. When operating the handles, the up-locks will be released, either by mechanical, electrical or pneumatic means. This allows each landing gear to free-fall under its own weight. Some emergency extension systems (as mentioned above) use bottles of compressed air or compressed nitrogen to extend the gear, thereby overcoming any small jams that would otherwise keep the gear in the up position. Nitrogen is better as it is non-flammable, and air contains oxygen, which will feed a potential fire. Compressed air is easier (and cheaper) to bottle though. The gear will remain in the down and locked position because of the mechanical down locks that come into place automatically. The doors will not retract after this, as there is no available system to do so, so they remain in the down position. The shuttle valve mentioned in this question is a way to feed one actuator with two different pressure sources. When one pressure source loses pressure, the piston can slide across from blocking the emergency source to blocking the usual source, allowing out the emergency pressure to feed the actuator. This can be automatic or manually controlled. A diagram of the shuttle valve is shown in the annex above.",

There are multiple levels of braking available, for progressively shorter runways, requiring a progressively higher rate of deceleration. Anti-skid must be operative for autobrake to work. The autobrake cannot control the aircraft laterally, so it would be really bad if the wheels locked up (on a wet runway without anti-skid), and therefore it cannot be used at all if anti-skid is not available. Autobrakes will be disarmed during use by any of the following conditions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. Otherwise, the autobrake system will continue meeting a selected rate of deceleration until making a complete stop. Whilst one of the other options mentions setting a fixed stopping distance, this is a lot more complex than it sounds, but a system like this has been implemented on newer Airbus A380 and A350 aircraft called BTV (Brake to Vacate). EASA are not yet including this in the learning objectives or questions, so assume it does not exist for the ATPL exams.",

External damage such as flat-spots, embedded objects, cuts or bulges in the sidewall can make any tyre unsuitable to be used. The tread of the tyre is the rubber section which contacts the floor, usually with grooves or a pattern in it to clear water. It is a key component for protecting the other parts of the tyre. The sidewall is the bit on the side of the tyre that connects the tread to the \"bead\", which is fitted to the wheel rim, it is a very vulnerable section of the tyre, with less protection. Objects embedded in the tyre cause obvious damage to the structural integrity, which could lead to blow outs or slow punctures, both of which are very bad for any ground movements, take off and landing. Note: We are well aware that the pilot should check for both embedded objects and tyre creep when performing their walk around, so would be inclined to appeal this question if it came up in this format. We believe that embedded items are worse than tyre creep, but they should certainly both be checked. Any further exam feedback about this question would be useful to check what EASA are choosing as correct, as well as their choice of options in the future.",

Therefore, We chose to compare them to single disc carbon brakes. The only difference in answer can occur if they compare multi-disc steel brakes to multi-disc carbon brakes directly, in which case the carbon brakes have higher braking strength usually. Please let us know what was actually on the exam if you do see this, and we can adjust it as necessary, thanks! The two usual materials for aircraft brakes are steel and carbon. They vary somewhat in characteristics, and in cost. Steel brakes are usually much cheaper than carbon brakes. Steel brakes perform better at lower temperatures, and when they get hot, suffer from brake fade, where the rotors do not apply as much traction onto the stators due to the intense heat. Carbon brakes, however, have a much hotter operating window. In fact, carbon brakes are not very effective at low temperatures, so need to have some heat in them already, to be able to produce the peak braking force. This is why the two types should be treated differently. Steel brakes should be kept cool, by using them many times, but softly with gaps to allow them to cool. Carbon brakes, on the other hand, should be applied firmly all at once when possible, to allow them to work in their operating window as much as possible, and because their wear is more linked to amount of applications, rather than total heat input. In most transport aircraft, the brakes need to absorb vast amounts of heat during landings, rejected take-offs and taxiing, much more than could be absorbed by a single disk and pair of brake pads. Therefore, their brakes are usually made up of multiple (spinning) brake discs separated by multiple (static) rings of brake pads. These multiple rings of stators and rotors can provide much stronger braking and absorb far more heat than a single disc and pair of pads alone, steel or carbon.",

Tyre covers must be examined for cuts, bulges, embedded stones, metal or glass, signs of wear, creep, local sponginess, etc. Operation with damaged tyres may result in tyre burst that can cause further damage to the airframe or lead to a ground collision/runway excursion. The defects which may make the cover unserviceable are: Cuts. Cuts in the tyre cover penetrating to the cords render the tyre unserviceable and must be repaired. Bulges. These may indicate partial failure of the casing, if the casing has failed. Foreign Bodies. Embedded stones, metal, glass etc. These must NOT be removed but reported to maintenance staff. Wear. Pattern tread covers worn to the base of the marker grooves or marker tie bars for 25% of the tyre circumference, or plain tread covers worn to the casing fabric, must not be used. Creep. Movement of the tyre round the wheel must not exceed 1 in for tyres of up to 24 in outside diameter and 1 1⁄2 in for tyres over 24 in outside diameter. If these limits are exceeded, the tyre must be removed from the wheel and the tube examined for signs of tearing at the valve. A check of the ply/speed rating, tread depth measurement, and tyre pressure measurement is usually the job of an engineer, and is not required before every single flight, however checking tyre creep and embedded objects are quick enough, and important enough tasks to require a check of every tyre before flight.",

Statement 2: when reverse thrust is activated. Incorrect, the autobrake remains active also when reverse thrust is activated. The auto-brake system can be used for automated braking during landing or during a rejected take-off (RTO). There are several modes the auto-brakes can be in: Off Armed the auto-brake system is ready to be used but there are conditions which have to be met before the auto-brakes start operating. Activated When the system was armed and the necessary conditions have been met the system can be activated in different ways depending on the type of aircraft. The auto-brake system is not useable when the alternate braking system is in use. Depending on the type of aircraft, 3 to 5 modes of deceleration can be selected. Anti-skid protection is provided during autobrake operation, with inoperative anti-skid the auto-brake system will not operate. The autobrakes will be armed once a deceleration mode has been selected. When the aircraft touches down and the main wheels spin up or by the means of weight on wheels the auto-land system will be activated. The auto-land system continues to brake until a complete stop or until the auto-brakes are disarmed. The selected deceleration mode will give a standard deceleration rate independent on the weight of the aircraft for a dry runway. Disarming of the autobrakes will occur by any of the following crew actions: Manual braking Advancing any thrust lever after landing Moving the speed brake lever to down after speed brakes have been deployed on the ground. Moving the autobrake selector to Disarm or Off. When RTO is selected, the maximum brake pressure will be applied when all thrust levers a closed above a ground speed of 85 knots. So below this 85 knots the autobrakes are not activated.",

Please let us know if you see either in the exam, and whatever you can remember about them, thank you! FLY-BY-WIRE In a Fly-By-Wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, moving the flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which significantly enhances safety. For instance, on the Airbus, the flight mode of Normal Law provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-AoA and bank angle. In addition, Low Speed Protection is available in certain phases of flight. The bank angle protection system on a FBW aircraft can change the effect of control inputs to make it harder to maintain a bank angle that is outside of limits. For instance, in the Airbus A320, above 33°, force is needed to maintain the bank angle. The aircraft will not allow bank angles past 67° in normal law. In this question the bank angle protections have activated improperly at 30° AoB, so more force will be required to maintain or increase the angle of bank.",

            "explanation": "As a fully manual flight control system is reversible the pilot feels all forces acting on the control surfaces in the controls. So the pilot must be able to exert sufficient force to overcome the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces. Primary flight controls Are controls which movement causes a rotation about one of the three axes of the aircraft, causing a change in the aircraft’s flightpath or attitude. The elevator, rudder and ailerons are considered to be the primary flight controls. The primary flight controls in a manually controlled system are reversible. This means that a force applied to the controls is a force which moves the control surface, and also a force which moves the control surface will move the pilot’s controls. This means that the air pressure on the control surface can be felt in the pilot’s controls. When the flight controls are fully power operated this is not the case and is called irreversible. This means that if there is a force moving the control surface this will not move the control columns, and there will be no natural feel on the controls. Because of this there will need to be an artificial feel unit installed in a fully powered or irreversible control system. This artificial feel unit should apply force to the cockpit controls in proportion to the control deflection and in proportion to the aircraft’s speed. This artificial feel system will also work with a trim system, but this works different than a normal trim surface does. A movement of the trimwheel will result in a movement of the electric trim actuator, and so the control surface, but not in the movement of the control column (this is for elevator control). It is different for aileron and rudder trim. Elevator trim: zero force position of the control column does not change (control column/horn/stick does not move) Aileron trim: zero force position changes (control wheel turns in the direction of the trim) Rudder trim: zero force position changes (pedals move in the direction of the trim)",
