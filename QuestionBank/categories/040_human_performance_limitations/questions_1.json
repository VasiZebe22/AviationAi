An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture.

The SHELL Model contains the following four components: Liveware (L). At the centre of the model is the pilot. Man - the most valuable and flexible component of the system. The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

Crew Resource Management (CRM): CRM principles emphasize effective teamwork and communication within the cockpit. By involving all members in the discussion. Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued.

(.) Latent Lastly, some threats may not be directly obvious to, or observable by, flight crews immersed in flight operations, and may need to be uncovered by safety analysis. These are considered latent threats and may include organisational weaknesses and the psychological state of the pilot such as: Organisational culture/changes; Incorrect/incomplete documentation; Equipment design issues; Operational pressures/delays; Optical illusions; Fatigue/rostering; Stress; Complacency; Over or under confidence; Lack of recent experience and proficiency Regardless of whether threats are anticipated, unanticipated, or latent, one measure of the effectiveness of a flight crew’s ability to manage threats is whether threats are detected promptly enough to enable the flight crew to respond to them before a UAS develops by taking the appropriate actions.",

The SHELL Model contains the following four components: Liveware (L). At the centre of the model is the pilot. Man - the most valuable and flexible component of the system. The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

If the risk is considered to be unacceptable, then control measures are taken to fortify and increase the level of defences against that risk or to avoid or remove the risk, if this is economically feasible. Look at take-off performance for instance. Of course, it would be safer to impose a rule that every runway needs to be 2x longer than the TODR, but it is going to be extremely expensive to build up to 6000 m runways. And even then, it would be safer still to be 3x the TODR, or even safer, 4x the TODR. You can see where this is going. We have to draw the line somewhere, with an \"acceptable\" risk level. This is obviously incredibly low, and the industry should always attempt to lower it further, but there will never be NO risk.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Such complexities would include, for example, dealing with adverse meteorological conditions, airports surrounded by high mountains, congested airspace, aircraft malfunctions, errors committed by other people outside of the cockpit, such as air traffic controllers, flight attendants or maintenance workers, and so forth. The TEM model considers these complexities as threats because they all have the potential to negatively affect flight operations by reducing margins of safety; (.) (vii) Table 1 presents examples of threats, grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM Model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organisational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (for example removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organisations. Organisational threats are usually latent in nature. Flight crews still remain the last line of defence, but there are earlier opportunities for these threats to be mitigated by aviation organisations themselves. Environmental threats Organisational threats (A) weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross or tailwind, very low or high temperatures; (B) ATC: traffic congestion, ACAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication or units of measurement (QFE/meters); (C) airport: contaminated or short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of, confusing, faded signage, markings, birds, aids unserviceable, complex surface navigation procedures or airport constructions; (D) terrain: high ground, slope, lack of references or ‘black hole’; (E) other: similar call-signs. (A)operational pressure: delays, late arrivals or equipment changes; (B) aircraft: aircraft malfunction, automation event or anomaly, MEL/CDL; (C) cabin: flight attendant error, cabin event distraction, interruption, cabin door security; (D) maintenance: maintenance event or error; (E) ground: ground-handling event, de-icing or ground crew error; (F) dispatch: dispatch paperwork event or error; (G) documentation: manual error or chart error; (H) other: crew scheduling event.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

            "explanation": "The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. It is based on three components, threats, errors and undesired aircraft states. Threats are the first line of defence, and are times or places where a potential error could be made quite easily. They can be classed as latent threats, environmental threats, or organisational threats, depending on how the threat has occurred in the first place. Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occurred to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations We would consider this scenario a threat - because actually, no errors have yet occurred, all procedures have been followed and it is not going to cause a problem at this stage. The problem is that if the pilot monitoring now has a different mental model to the pilot flying, an error could be induced sometime after, which could be due to a huge number of factors. For example, if the pilot monitoring were to set up the approach shortly after by changing some items on the automation, but does not realise that a particular mode is active, they could change the aircraft course, altitude or speed accidentally. That would be an error, quickly leading to an undesired aircraft state. Whilst we classify errors as procedural, aircraft handling and communication, threats can either be latent, environmental or organisational, but this examiner has also classified the communication threats (as if it were a communication error, but only at the level of threat) as such, which we do not fully agree with. The problem is that we don't agree with any of the other options, as we think neither pilot made an error, so we are choosing the best of a bad bunch. Unfortunately, it is not rare for EASA to make a question with bad options like this one, so we think the feedback could easily be fully correct.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

            "explanation": "The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. It is based on three components, threats, errors and undersired aircraft states. Threats are the first line of defense, and are times or places where a potential error could be made qute easily. They can be classed as latent threats, environmental threats, or organisational threats, depending on how the threat has occured in the first place. Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occured to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations. There are some counter-measures that can be put in place to aid Threat and Error Management, probably the largest of which is the set of systemic counter-measures that are put in place by all operators. These are parts of the system that have been created or develoed specificaly to aid TEM and safety procedure. They can be things like: Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS/TCAS) Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) TEM training (CRM training also) Briefings Checklists These all promote and help TEM as they provide the flight crew with more opportunities to notice threats, errors and undesired aircraft states, as well as good tools to mitigate any such errors, and get out of the undesired states.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Threats can be grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organizational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (i.e., removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organizations. Organizational threats are usually latent in nature. Table 1. Examples of threats (List not inclusive) Environmental Threats Organizational Threats Weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross/tailwind, very low/high temperatures. ATC: traffic congestion, TCAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication, units of measurement (QFE/meters). Airport: contaminated/short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of/confusing/faded signage/markings, birds, aids U/S, complex surface navigation procedures, airport constructions. Terrain: High ground, slope, lack of references, “black hole”. Other: similar call-signs. Operational pressure: delays, late arrivals, equipment changes.

An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Individuals feel encouraged and supported to report any safety-related issues without fear of punishment or reprisal. The focus is on learning from mistakes and using reported data to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and implement improvements to prevent future incidents. Learning culture. An organization must demonstrate both the willingness and the capability to draw appropriate conclusions from its safety information system. Moreover, it should also show a strong determination to implement significant reforms based on those conclusions. Just culture. In a conducive atmosphere, unintentional errors and unsafe acts are not subjected to punishment. However, individuals who exhibit recklessness or willingly take unjustifiable risks remain liable for disciplinary action. Flexible culture. In this culture, organizations can adapt to high-tempo operations or specific types of danger, often transitioning from a traditional hierarchical structure to a more flexible and flattened mode.",

A strong safety culture is essential for ensuring the highest levels of safety in aviation operations, as it influences decision-making, behaviors, and attitudes towards safety throughout the organization. It is an ongoing process that requires continuous effort and commitment. 1. Open Culture: Open culture refers to an organizational environment characterized by transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. In an open culture, there is an emphasis on communication and information sharing, where employees feel empowered to express their opinions, ideas, and concerns freely without fear of reprisal. Decision-making processes are often participatory, and feedback is actively sought and welcomed. Open cultures foster trust among team members and promote innovation, as individuals feel encouraged to challenge the status quo and explore new ways of doing things. 2. Closed Culture: Closed culture describes an organizational environment characterized by secrecy, hierarchy, and limited communication. In a closed culture, information is often tightly controlled, and decisions are made by a select few individuals at the top of the hierarchy, without input from lower-level employees. There is a lack of transparency and trust, which can lead to a culture of suspicion and resentment among team members. Innovation and creativity are stifled in closed cultures, as individuals may feel discouraged from speaking up or taking risks.",

If threats are eliminated, errors will be minimized. If errors are detected, undesired aircraft states will be minimized as well. Errors are defined as actions or inactions by the flight crew that lead to deviations from organizational or flight crew intentions or expectations. Flight crews must, as part of the normal discharge of their operational duties, employ countermeasures to keep threats, errors and undesired aircraft states from reducing margins of safety in flight operations. Examples of countermeasures would include checklists, briefings, call-outs and SOPs, as well as personal strategies and tactics. The captain not following the SOPs is an error ('deviation from organizational or flight crew expectations') that can lead to an undesired aircraft state. Since the first officer recognized the error, he/she should inform the captain about the error and employ countermeasures by insisting on doing the checklist again properly, so nothing is missed.",

The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

            "explanation": "OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE Oxygen forms 21% of the total air in the atmosphere. The partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere is therefore 21% of the total atmospheric pressure (Dalton's law). This gives an oxygen partial pressure of 160 mmHg at MSL. The total atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude and so does the partial pressure of oxygen. In the human lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases further (14%) due to the presence of the breathing waste products (carbon dioxide and water vapor). The required oxygen partial pressure for the human lungs to work properly is 55 mmHg. A reduction of the oxygen partial pressure below that value can lead to hypoxia. An oxygen partial pressure of 55 mmHg occurs at 10 000 ft. This means that above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should be increased. Above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should start increasing. At 33 700 ft the oxygen should become 100% of the cabin air in order to be equivalent to breathing air at MSL. At 40 000 ft breathing 100% oxygen is equivalent to breathing ambient air at 10 000 ft. Above 40 000 ft 100% oxygen under positive pressure should be provided. Based on exam feedback the correct answer is '32 000 ft'. Please provide any further feedback available in the comments.",

An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Learning culture. An organization must possess the willingness and the competence to draw the right conclusions from its safety information system and the will to implement major reforms. Just culture. An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture. A culture in which an organisation is able to reconfigure themselves in the face of high tempo operations or certain kinds of danger – often shifting from conventional hierarchical mode to a flatter mode.",

The SHELL Model contains the following four components: Liveware (L). At the centre of the model is the pilot. Man - the most valuable and flexible component of the system. The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued.

The pallet of freight being placed in the forward hold, instead of where it was supposed to be placed (the aft hold) means that the aircraft's CG is actually further forward than the pilots are aware of. The location of an aircraft's CG is an important factor for many things, both for stability and control as well as for the aircraft's performance. When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce. For every bit of lift the wing produces though, there is some induced drag that occurs, which means that further forward CG locations cause higher drag, and therefore lower climb performance, shorter aircraft range, and generally worse efficiency. It is possible that the forward CG would have an effect on yaw, due to the slightly longer moment arm of the fin and rudder, but the effect would be incredibly small, particularly when compared to the other effects it causes.",

This is true because visual warnings draw the eye to them, which takes it off the task at hand, and means the brain now has to process whatever the warning is showing, rather than what it was doing before the warning occured. This is most often intentional on the part of the cockpit designer, as some warnings are important enough to need the pilots attention over the current task. Visual warnings are also useful as they can also stay on without causing too much annoyance, as an aural warning might. To cover the other options, we would not say that visual warnings are \"more ergonomic\" than aural warnings. This is mainly because aural warnings can be processed by the pilot alongside their current task without having to divert the gaze. We would say that visual warnings have a variable effect on situational awareness. They improve awareness of whatever they are indicating, but not as well as aural warnings, and can draw the pilot's attention from the other parts of situational awareness. Therefore, that answer is not fully correct. Aural warnings allow for simultaneous processing of information (somewhat - but not fully, there is still some distraction), but this is not the case for visual warnings.",

This definition emphasises the direct and powerful influence of an organisation’s leadership group on the safety attitudes and behaviour of employees. Every individual involved in operations has to support the safety culture, the duty of the \"higher levels\" of management is to ensure that all required resources are available. Dr James Reason has suggested that safety culture consists of five elements: An informed culture A reporting culture A learning culture A just culture A flexible culture Informed culture. The organization collects and analyses relevant data, and actively disseminates safety information. Reporting culture. An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Learning culture. An organization must possess the willingness and the competence to draw the right conclusions from its safety information system and the will to implement major reforms. Just culture. An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture. A culture in which an organisation is able to reconfigure themselves in the face of high tempo operations or certain kinds of danger – often shifting from conventional hierarchical mode to a flatter mode.",

This definition emphasises the direct and powerful influence of an organisation’s leadership group on the safety attitudes and behaviour of employees. Once a safety culture is established and maintained it is is relatively enduring, stable and resistant to change. Dr James Reason has suggested that safety culture consists of five elements: An informed culture A reporting culture A learning culture A just culture A flexible culture Informed culture. The organization collects and analyses relevant data, and actively disseminates safety information. Reporting culture. An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Learning culture. An organization must possess the willingness and the competence to draw the right conclusions from its safety information system and the will to implement major reforms. Just culture. An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture. A culture in which an organisation is able to reconfigure themselves in the face of high tempo operations or certain kinds of danger – often shifting from conventional hierarchical mode to a flatter mode.",

Fatigue is a major human factors hazard because it affects most aspects of a crewmember’s ability to do their job. It therefore has implications for safety. ICAO defines a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as: A data-driven means of continuously monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety risks, based upon scientific principles and knowledge as well as operational experience that aims to ensure relevant personnel are performing at adequate levels of alertness. An FRMS aims to ensure that flight and cabin crew members are sufficiently alert so they can operate to a satisfactory level of performance. It is a set of guidelines aimed at reducing fatigue-induced safety risks and considers additional factors such as the circadian rhythm, the importance of adequate sleep within the rest period, and the unique properties of the individual operation. FRMS is based on computer models which anticipate the expected performance capability of a person from his/her sleep/awake history. Such models must be continuously updated by analyses of data and reports. The quality of the FRMS depends on its ability to learn. The term used for this kind of safety culture is “learning culture”. It is also dependent on the willingness of aircrew to report fatigue-related issues and in a culture where crew members are encouraged to report safety risks. However, such safety cultured is named “just culture” and not “non-punitive culture”.",

Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries.

Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures.

It involves recognizing threats, errors, and undesired aircraft states to prevent accidents or incidents. In the context of preventing a runway excursion after touchdown, it is imperative for flight crews to consistently maintain a stabilized approach during the final phases of landing. This entails strict adherence to predetermined criteria governing airspeed, descent rate, and runway alignment. In the event that an approach becomes destabilized, thereby elevating the risk of a runway excursion, it is incumbent upon pilots to promptly implement corrective measures to restore stability before the landing occurs. This ensures a safe and controlled touchdown and subsequent rollout on the runway. If the approach is not stable by 1 000 feet AGL or 500 feet AGL (depending on weather conditions), or if the approach becomes unstable below these altitudes, the pilot should initiate a missed approach/go around.",

A resilient company prioritizes safety because it ensures long-term sustainability and reliability. Efficiency focuses on maximizing output and minimizing waste, often emphasizing cost reduction and speed of operations. While efficiency is important, it should not come at the expense of safety. If more resources are directed towards efficiency, it suggests that the company might be overlooking potential safety risks, indicating a lack of resilience. In times of crisis, such companies might struggle to maintain operations and recover effectively.

The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

Different crew members may interpret the information differently, and discussing it helps align their perceptions. Crew Resource Management (CRM): CRM principles emphasize effective teamwork and communication within the cockpit. By involving all members in the discussion. Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued. It empowers co-pilots, including the young and less experienced one, to voice concerns, ask questions, and contribute to the safety of the flight.",

The SHELL Model contains the following four components: Liveware (L). At the centre of the model is the pilot. Man - the most valuable and flexible component of the system. The second ‘L’ represents other humans whether inside or outside the aircraft. Software (S). Includes procedures, training, support, manuals, checklist layouts, maps and charts, computer programmes. Hardware (H). Relates to machines and equipment. Including cockpit layout, physical aircraft structure, instruments presentation and position of controls. Environment (E). The working environment in which the rest of the L-H-S system must function - conditions both inside and outside the cockpit. Interaction of different component of the SHELL Model: Liveware-Hardware (L-H). The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

If the risk is considered to be unacceptable, then control measures are taken to fortify and increase the level of defences against that risk or to avoid or remove the risk, if this is economically feasible. Look at take-off performance for instance. Of course, it would be safer to impose a rule that every runway needs to be 2x longer than the TODR, but it is going to be extremely expensive to build up to 6000 m runways. And even then, it would be safer still to be 3x the TODR, or even safer, 4x the TODR. You can see where this is going. We have to draw the line somewhere, with an \"acceptable\" risk level. This is obviously incredibly low, and the industry should always attempt to lower it further, but there will never be NO risk.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Such complexities would include, for example, dealing with adverse meteorological conditions, airports surrounded by high mountains, congested airspace, aircraft malfunctions, errors committed by other people outside of the cockpit, such as air traffic controllers, flight attendants or maintenance workers, and so forth. The TEM model considers these complexities as threats because they all have the potential to negatively affect flight operations by reducing margins of safety; (.) (vii) Table 1 presents examples of threats, grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM Model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organisational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (for example removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organisations. Organisational threats are usually latent in nature. Flight crews still remain the last line of defence, but there are earlier opportunities for these threats to be mitigated by aviation organisations themselves. Environmental threats Organisational threats (A) weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross or tailwind, very low or high temperatures; (B) ATC: traffic congestion, ACAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication or units of measurement (QFE/meters); (C) airport: contaminated or short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of, confusing, faded signage, markings, birds, aids unserviceable, complex surface navigation procedures or airport constructions; (D) terrain: high ground, slope, lack of references or ‘black hole’; (E) other: similar call-signs. (A)operational pressure: delays, late arrivals or equipment changes; (B) aircraft: aircraft malfunction, automation event or anomaly, MEL/CDL; (C) cabin: flight attendant error, cabin event distraction, interruption, cabin door security; (D) maintenance: maintenance event or error; (E) ground: ground-handling event, de-icing or ground crew error; (F) dispatch: dispatch paperwork event or error; (G) documentation: manual error or chart error; (H) other: crew scheduling event.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

It is based on three components, threats, errors and undesired aircraft states. Threats are the first line of defence, and are times or places where a potential error could be made quite easily. They can be classed as latent threats, environmental threats, or organisational threats, depending on how the threat has occurred in the first place. Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occurred to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations We would consider this scenario a threat - because actually, no errors have yet occurred, all procedures have been followed and it is not going to cause a problem at this stage. The problem is that if the pilot monitoring now has a different mental model to the pilot flying, an error could be induced sometime after, which could be due to a huge number of factors. For example, if the pilot monitoring were to set up the approach shortly after by changing some items on the automation, but does not realise that a particular mode is active, they could change the aircraft course, altitude or speed accidentally. That would be an error, quickly leading to an undesired aircraft state. Whilst we classify errors as procedural, aircraft handling and communication, threats can either be latent, environmental or organisational, but this examiner has also classified the communication threats (as if it were a communication error, but only at the level of threat) as such, which we do not fully agree with. The problem is that we don't agree with any of the other options, as we think neither pilot made an error, so we are choosing the best of a bad bunch. Unfortunately, it is not rare for EASA to make a question with bad options like this one, so we think the feedback could easily be fully correct.

Your attention to this detail is greatly appreciated. Thank you! The Threat and Error Management (TEM) model is a conceptual framework that assists in understanding, from an operational perspective, the inter-relationship between safety and human performance in dynamic and challenging operational contexts. The TEM model classifies errors based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Thus, in order to be classified as aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with the aircraft (e.g. through its controls, automation or systems). In order to be classified as procedural error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with a procedure (e.g. checklists; SOPs; etc). In order to be classified as communication error, the pilot or flight crew must be interacting with people (ATC; groundcrew; other crewmembers, etc). Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation In this case, the commander committed a handling error by allowing the speed to increase above the required, possibly by insertting an incorrect speed into the MCP. The co-pilot, on the other hand, whose job was to monitor the height and speed, committed a procedural error (SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs or even by omitting ot making incorrect callouts).",

The L-H interface, known as \"man <=> machine\" interface\", refers to the relationship between the human and the physical attributes of equipment, machines and facilities. Liveware-Software (L-S). The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain.

Errors are classified based upon the primary interaction of the pilot or flight crew at the moment the error is committed. Therefore they can be classed as aircraft handling errors, procedural errors or communication errors, depending on what has occured to let the error happen. These are three of the main error types. Undesired aircraft states occur due to errors being allowed to happen and potentially putting the aircraft in a state that it should not be in, undesired attitude, location, low on fuel, etc. These are a consequence, but if the threat and following error have not been picked up by the flight crew already, then the undesired aircraft state is where the flight crew should realise that there is a problem, and take action to return to safe operations. There are some counter-measures that can be put in place to aid Threat and Error Management, probably the largest of which is the set of systemic counter-measures that are put in place by all operators. These are parts of the system that have been created or develoed specificaly to aid TEM and safety procedure. They can be things like: Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS/TCAS) Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) TEM training (CRM training also) Briefings Checklists These all promote and help TEM as they provide the flight crew with more opportunities to notice threats, errors and undesired aircraft states, as well as good tools to mitigate any such errors, and get out of the undesired states.",

During typical flight operations, flight crews have to manage various contextual complexities. Threats can be grouped under two basic categories derived from the TEM model. Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time. Organizational threats, on the other hand, can be controlled (i.e., removed or, at least, minimised) at source by aviation organizations. Organizational threats are usually latent in nature. Table 1. Examples of threats (List not inclusive) Environmental Threats Organizational Threats Weather: thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, wind shear, cross/tailwind, very low/high temperatures. ATC: traffic congestion, TCAS RA/TA, ATC command, ATC error, ATC language difficulty, ATC non-standard phraseology, ATC runway change, ATIS communication, units of measurement (QFE/meters). Airport: contaminated/short runway; contaminated taxiway, lack of/confusing/faded signage/markings, birds, aids U/S, complex surface navigation procedures, airport constructions.

An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Individuals feel encouraged and supported to report any safety-related issues without fear of punishment or reprisal. The focus is on learning from mistakes and using reported data to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and implement improvements to prevent future incidents. Learning culture. An organization must demonstrate both the willingness and the capability to draw appropriate conclusions from its safety information system. Moreover, it should also show a strong determination to implement significant reforms based on those conclusions. Just culture. In a conducive atmosphere, unintentional errors and unsafe acts are not subjected to punishment. However, individuals who exhibit recklessness or willingly take unjustifiable risks remain liable for disciplinary action. Flexible culture. In this culture, organizations can adapt to high-tempo operations or specific types of danger, often transitioning from a traditional hierarchical structure to a more flexible and flattened mode.",

Open Culture: Open culture refers to an organizational environment characterized by transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. In an open culture, there is an emphasis on communication and information sharing, where employees feel empowered to express their opinions, ideas, and concerns freely without fear of reprisal. Decision-making processes are often participatory, and feedback is actively sought and welcomed. Open cultures foster trust among team members and promote innovation, as individuals feel encouraged to challenge the status quo and explore new ways of doing things. 2. Closed Culture: Closed culture describes an organizational environment characterized by secrecy, hierarchy, and limited communication. In a closed culture, information is often tightly controlled, and decisions are made by a select few individuals at the top of the hierarchy, without input from lower-level employees. There is a lack of transparency and trust, which can lead to a culture of suspicion and resentment among team members. Innovation and creativity are stifled in closed cultures, as individuals may feel discouraged from speaking up or taking risks.",

The L-S interface is the relationship between the human and the supporting systems found in the workplace, e.g. regulations, manuals, checklists, publications, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and computer software. It includes such issues as recency of experience, accuracy, format and presentation, vocabulary, clarity and symbology. Liveware-Liveware (L-L). The L-L interface is the relationship among persons in the work environment. Since flight crews, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers and other operational personnel function in groups, it is important to recognize that communication and inter-personal skills, as well as group dynamics play a role in determining human performance. Liveware-Environment (L-E). This interface involves the relationship between the human and both the internal and external environments. The internal workplace environment includes such physical considerations as temperature, ambient light, noise, vibration and air quality. The external environment includes operational aspects such as weather factors, aviation infrastructure and terrain. This interface also involves the relationship between the human internal environment and its external environment.",

            "explanation": "OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE Oxygen forms 21% of the total air in the atmosphere. The partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere is therefore 21% of the total atmospheric pressure (Dalton's law). This gives an oxygen partial pressure of 160 mmHg at MSL. The total atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude and so does the partial pressure of oxygen. In the human lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases further (14%) due to the presence of the breathing waste products (carbon dioxide and water vapor). The required oxygen partial pressure for the human lungs to work properly is 55 mmHg. A reduction of the oxygen partial pressure below that value can lead to hypoxia. An oxygen partial pressure of 55 mmHg occurs at 10 000 ft. This means that above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should be increased. Above 10 000 ft oxygen percentage should start increasing. At 33 700 ft the oxygen should become 100% of the cabin air in order to be equivalent to breathing air at MSL. At 40 000 ft breathing 100% oxygen is equivalent to breathing ambient air at 10 000 ft. Above 40 000 ft 100% oxygen under positive pressure should be provided. Based on exam feedback the correct answer is '32 000 ft'. Please provide any further feedback available in the comments.",

The organization collects and analyses relevant data, and actively disseminates safety information. Reporting culture. An organizational climate in which people are prepared to report their errors and near-misses. Learning culture. An organization must possess the willingness and the competence to draw the right conclusions from its safety information system and the will to implement major reforms. Just culture. An atmosphere where errors and unsafe acts will not be punished if the error was unintentional. However, those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks will still be subject to disciplinary action. Flexible culture. A culture in which an organisation is able to reconfigure themselves in the face of high tempo operations or certain kinds of danger – often shifting from conventional hierarchical mode to a flatter mode.",

Different crew members may interpret the information differently, and discussing it helps align their perceptions. Crew Resource Management (CRM): CRM principles emphasize effective teamwork and communication within the cockpit. By involving all members in the discussion. Situational Awareness: Discussing potential threats promotes situational awareness, which is vital for making informed decisions throughout the flight. Mitigating Risks: By openly discussing potential threats, the crew can identify and prioritize these risks. This collaborative approach allows for the development of strategies and contingency plans to mitigate these risks effectively. Empowering the Crew: Engaging all crew members in discussions fosters a culture where everyone's input is valued. It empowers co-pilots, including the young and less experienced one, to voice concerns, ask questions, and contribute to the safety of the flight.",

However, a student has confirmed on the comments section of question 813331 that it appeared in their HPL exam. If you do come across this question in HPL, please make sure that you appeal it. The pallet of freight being placed in the forward hold, instead of where it was supposed to be placed (the aft hold) means that the aircraft's CG is actually further forward than the pilots are aware of. The location of an aircraft's CG is an important factor for many things, both for stability and control as well as for the aircraft's performance. When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce. For every bit of lift the wing produces though, there is some induced drag that occurs, which means that further forward CG locations cause higher drag, and therefore lower climb performance, shorter aircraft range, and generally worse efficiency. It is possible that the forward CG would have an effect on yaw, due to the slightly longer moment arm of the fin and rudder, but the effect would be incredibly small, particularly when compared to the other effects it causes.",

We agree with the current feedback that visual warnings disrupt the crew's workflow. This is true because visual warnings draw the eye to them, which takes it off the task at hand, and means the brain now has to process whatever the warning is showing, rather than what it was doing before the warning occured. This is most often intentional on the part of the cockpit designer, as some warnings are important enough to need the pilots attention over the current task. Visual warnings are also useful as they can also stay on without causing too much annoyance, as an aural warning might. To cover the other options, we would not say that visual warnings are \"more ergonomic\" than aural warnings. This is mainly because aural warnings can be processed by the pilot alongside their current task without having to divert the gaze. We would say that visual warnings have a variable effect on situational awareness. They improve awareness of whatever they are indicating, but not as well as aural warnings, and can draw the pilot's attention from the other parts of situational awareness. Therefore, that answer is not fully correct. Aural warnings allow for simultaneous processing of information (somewhat - but not fully, there is still some distraction), but this is not the case for visual warnings.",

Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation",

Environmental threats occur due to the environment in which flight operations take place. Some environmental threats can be planned for and some will arise spontaneously, but they all have to be managed by flight crews in real time.

Fatigue is a major human factors hazard because it affects most aspects of a crewmember’s ability to do their job. It therefore has implications for safety. ICAO defines a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as: A data-driven means of continuously monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety risks, based upon scientific principles and knowledge as well as operational experience that aims to ensure relevant personnel are performing at adequate levels of alertness. An FRMS aims to ensure that flight and cabin crew members are sufficiently alert so they can operate to a satisfactory level of performance. It is a set of guidelines aimed at reducing fatigue-induced safety risks and considers additional factors such as the circadian rhythm, the importance of adequate sleep within the rest period, and the unique properties of the individual operation. FRMS is based on computer models which anticipate the expected performance capability of a person from his/her sleep/awake history. Such models must be continuously updated by analyses of data and reports. The quality of the FRMS depends on its ability to learn. The term used for this kind of safety culture is “learning culture”. It is also dependent on the willingness of aircrew to report fatigue-related issues and in a culture where crew members are encouraged to report safety risks. However, such safety cultured is named “just culture” and not “non-punitive culture”.",

Over the past several years, many studies have been conducted on the influence of national culture in the workplace. These studies focused on a number of dimensions, but primarily sought to answer whether people will first act in the interest of what their national culture expects of them, or first act in the interest of maintaining a safe work environment. In this case, it is pretty clear that national culture is taking precedence over safety culture.",

This model categorizes errors based on how the pilot or flight crew is involved when the error occurs. Errors are subdivided into aircraft handling, procedural and communication errors. To be considered an aircraft handling error, the pilot or flight crew must be actively engaged with the aircraft, such as its controls, automation, or systems. Procedural errors are classified when the pilot or flight crew make mistakes while following procedures, such as checklists or standard operating procedures (SOPs). Communication errors are categorized when the pilot or flight crew make mistakes during interactions with people, such as air traffic control (ATC), ground crew, or other crew members. Aircraft Handling errors Manual handling/flight controls: vertical/lateral and/or speed deviations, incorrect flaps/speedbrakes, thrust reverser or power settings. Automation: incorrect altitude, speed, heading, autothrottle settings, incorrect mode executed, or incorrect entries. Systems/radio/instruments: incorrect packs, incorrect anti-icing, incorrect altimeter, incorrect fuel switches settings, incorrect speed bug, incorrect radio frequency dialled. Ground navigation: attempting to turn down wrong taxiway/runway, taxi too fast, failure to hold short, missed taxiway/runway. Procedural errors SOPs: failure to cross-verify automation inputs. Checklists: wrong challenge and response; items missed, checklist performed late or at the wrong time. Callouts: omitted/incorrect callouts Briefings: omitted briefings; items missed. Documentation: wrong weight and balance, fuel information, ATIS, or clearance information recorded, misinterpreted items on paperwork; incorrect logbook entries, incorrect application of MEL procedures. Communication errors Crew to external: missed calls, misinterpretations of instructions, incorrect read-back, wrong clearance, taxiway, gate or runway communicated. Pilot to pilot: within crew miscommunication or misinterpretation The aircraft executes a wrong automation mode while the commander is occupied correcting the speed and rate of descent.

It involves recognizing threats, errors, and undesired aircraft states to prevent accidents or incidents. In the context of preventing a runway excursion after touchdown, it is imperative for flight crews to consistently maintain a stabilized approach during the final phases of landing. This entails strict adherence to predetermined criteria governing airspeed, descent rate, and runway alignment. In the event that an approach becomes destabilized, thereby elevating the risk of a runway excursion, it is incumbent upon pilots to promptly implement corrective measures to restore stability before the landing occurs. This ensures a safe and controlled touchdown and subsequent rollout on the runway. If the approach is not stable by 1 000 feet AGL or 500 feet AGL (depending on weather conditions), or if the approach becomes unstable below these altitudes, the pilot should initiate a missed approach/go around.",

After approximately 15 to 30 seconds of constant angular acceleration, such as what occurs during a steady turn, the vestibular system stabilizes to the angular velocity and the pilot may have the illusion that rotation has ceased. The leans/somatogyral illusion occur when an abrupt recovery or a rapid correction is made to a bank. If you make such a recovery, your semicircular canals sense a roll in the opposite direction. This may cause you to reenter the original attitude. When you return the aircraft to a wings-level condition, you will tend to lean in the direction of the incorrect bank until the semicircular canal fluids return to normal. Maintaining a level attitude for a minute or two genrally will stop the leans.",

Stroke — High blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the brain to clog more easily or even burst. Kidney Damage — The increased pressure in the blood vessels can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, which play a crucial role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.

Size constancy relates to the expectations a pilot has on final approach in regards to the size of the runway in front of him: deviations from the familiar runway size, especially in combination with a lack of other objects of known size such as tress or buildings nearby, can cause them to misjudge the remaining distance along the glide path.

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

            "explanation": "\"He/she may experience a black hole illusion, so he/she needs to rely on his/her instruments.\" Incorrect. The \"black hole\" effect often leads pilots to fly a lower final approach than intended. It's worth noting that the black hole effect typically occurs during nighttime landings in dark conditions devoid of starlight or moonlight. Given the clear, blue sky and absence of clouds in the scenario described, it's unlikely to be attributed to the black hole effect. \"He/she feels like being too high, which may result in a short landing.\" Correct. The scenario described in the question entails a pilot making an approach over water toward a runway perpendicular to the shoreline. With a clear blue sky, discerning between the water and the sky becomes challenging. The Featureless Terrain Illusion occurs when noticeable ground features are absent, such as during overwater approaches, in snow-covered areas, or over darkened terrains. This phenomenon can create the false impression that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. Consequently, a pilot might descend prematurely, potentially resulting in a landing short of the runway. Note: This question was recently updated following recent feedback.

Initially, the hearing loss caused by loud noises may be temporary, but continued exposure to sounds louder than 85 decibels (dB) will lead to permanent hearing impairment. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. One of the initial signs is difficulty in perceiving high-pitched tones, as these notes are typically detected by the more delicate cells that are most susceptible to damage. In order to avoid NIHL, the individual should avoid being exposed to loud noise for prolonged periods. Helicopter pilots and military jet pilots tend to suffer from NIHL.

It includes cosmic radiation which comes from the sun and stars, terrestrial radiation which comes from the Earth, and civilisation radiation which results from medically applied radiation, household radiation, etc. This adds up to about 3.9 to 4.0 mSv per year in Europe. As stated above, everyone, everywhere, is exposed to cosmic radiation. We are protected from cosmic radiation by Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere. However, at higher altitudes in an airplane and particularly when closer to the North and South poles, the protection is less. During a commercial flight, cosmic radiation is several times higher than on the ground. According to studies, 1 h of flight time at cruise altitude cause an additional amount of 0.01 mSv of cosmic radiation, which means that the annual exposure of flight crew members adds up to about the same amount of background radiation.",

Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, and have a low level of visual acuity, as many rods are connected to each optic nerve fibre (so the \"resolution\" of the vision is less). Rods are highly sensitive to light, hence their usefulness in low light conditions. Conversely, cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), having much lower light sensitivity, and are capable of colour vision. They have a much higher visual and spatial acuity. The central fovea of the eye is populated exclusively by cones, which is the focal point of our vision. As mentioned above, the fovea contains only cones, but the surrounding area of the retina contains mostly rods, with some cones, just more sparsely populated. This means that the answer must be, \"Cones are more sensitive to colours than rods.\", as rods have no ability to detect colour, whereas cones do.",

It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal sleep is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase. => During any normal night’s sleep, the pattern operates on an approximately 90 minutes cycle. Towards the end of the first 90 minutes od falling asleep, the first REM stage occurs, but this first REM experience lasts only 10 to 20 minutes before the person passes back into slow wave sleep. At the end of the second cycle of 90 min, the duration of REM sleep periods increases. During a 8 hour sleep period, an individual is likely to experience 4 to 5 REM sleep episodes.",

This should be considered by operators when determining a reasonable time period for the guidance of crew members. Most divers know air travel immediately following a scuba dive increases the amount of nitrogen in your bodily tissues and can lead to decompression sickness. Looking at the GM (guidance material) above, the effective minimum is 24 hours between SCUBA diving and performing a flight. This is not reduced by using oxygen-enriched air (air cannisters with more than 21% oxygen), although this type of diving can decrease the usual chance of decompression sickness due to lower nitrogen pressure.

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

However, two functions are not compensated: night vision and learning ability. In addition, physiological reactions necessary may cause some fatigue. The civil regulation recognizes the altitude of 8 000 ft as the maximum permissible in the commercial transport of passengers (FAR and CS-25 § 841). c - The incomplete compensation zone is between 3 500 m to 6 000 m (between 11 500 ft and 18 500 ft to 20 000 ft). It is characterized by the risk of psychiatric disorders, typical of acute hypoxia. d - The critical zone is located beyond 5 500 to 6 000 m (18 500 to 20 000 ft).

It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

            "explanation": "ALCOHOL Alcohol acts as a sedative, so it can help you feel more at ease. It may make you feel more socially confident at a party or help you forget your worries. However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

Chemoreceptors in the circulatory system monitor the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the bloodstream and report it to the respiratory centre in the brain stem. When a predefined limit is exceeded, a breathing stimulus is generated. A low partial pressure of oxygen also triggers breathing. However, the strongest stimulus is the CO2 level. Normally, an increased concentration of carbon dioxide is the strongest stimulus to breathe more deeply and more frequently. Conversely, when the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood is low, the brain decreases the frequency and depth of breaths. Human blood always contains a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), which regulates the blood pH. An increase in carbon dioxide turns the blood acid (pH is lower), a decrease in carbon dioxide makes it more alkaline (pH is higher).",

Effects of Direction on Recovery – East or West, which is best? Travelling Westwards: London – New York New York is 5 hours behind London, so noon occurs 5 hours later. This means that an aircrew will experience a 29 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours, which means that the crew will suffer from 4 hours jet lag. Travelling Eastwards: New York – London London is 5 hours ahead of New York so noon occurs 5 hours earlier. This means that an aircrew will experience a 19 hour day. However, our free-running body clock is 25 hours which means that the crew will suffer from 6 hours jet leg. => Jet Lag after travelling westwards is less than Eastwards. Travelling east causes more problems than travelling west. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so lengthening a day is less troublesome than shortening it. Each individual must work out his/her own methods for dealing with circadian dysrhythmia because jet lag varies substantially among individuals.

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

This causes the eyes to relax and seek a comfortable focal distance which may range from 10 to 30 feet away, for example. For the pilot, this means looking without seeing, which is dangerous. Searching out and focusing on distant points, such as the tip of the wing or the edge of a cloud, will help to prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.

If a Rapid Decompression occurs, unconsciousness will develop very quickly if no action is taken. This is one reason why passengers shall fit their own mask before helping others. The first action by the flight crew must be to don oxygen masks. Once crew communication is established, if cabin altitude is deemed uncontrollable, pilots should initiate an emergency descent to the lowest safe altitude or 10 000 ft whichever is higher. In most airliners, the procedure is that the pilot flying shall advise the cabin crew, on the PA system, of impending rapid descent, whilst the pilot monitoring will advise ATC and obtain the area altimeter setting.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.

Finally, our need for alertness grows, telling us that it’s time to wake up. Our circadian rhythm approximates a homeostasis in coordination with environmental cues like sunlight.

Insect bites should be avoided as much as possible by wearing long clothing, using mosquito nets and repellents. Furthermore, many problems can be avoided by observing a strict personal hygiene routine and taking a few basic precautions. These measures should be observed in all parts of the world. They are: Do not drink tap water, you should drink water from sealed bottles only. Remember that even cleaning teeth in contaminated water can be enough to cause illness. Avoid ice in drinks, unless you are certain that the ice is made from treated water. Peel or cook all fruit and vegetables. The skin may have been contaminated by someone with a communicable disease or also washed with tap water. Avoid salad stuffs and other raw foods which may have been washed in contaminated water. Ice-creams should be avoid as these are generally made from raw fruits and water. You should also avoid swimming in local rivers or lakes as the water may be contaminated.

It passes through a small shutter which can either be flawed or can become jammed causing a rise in pressure of the eye. There are two main kinds of Glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type. This type progresses more slowly and the patient may not notice that they have lost vision; Angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye and is often painful. It’s also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and may cause severe pain and even blindness. The cure can either be by eye drops or by an operation in which a hole is made in the shutter. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. This condition can be inherited or may result from the aging process.",

Thus a person with two eyes has a far greater ability to judge relative distances when objects are nearby than a person who only has one eye. This is called Stereoscopic vision (often known as binocular vision). Binocular vision is more efficient at short distances - when the eyes converge to point to an object.

That being said, it seems that EASA would like a broad knowledge of medications. The usual size range of droplets dispersed by a nasal spray is between 10-50 micrometers. A micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, whereas a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, 1000 times smaller. Any smaller than this and the droplets become nebulized, and pass on directly to the lungs (not effective), whereas larger particles form droplets and run straight out of the nose. The droplets need to attach directly to the mucous membranes of the nose to be effective. Given the possible answers, about 7 to 12 micrometers would be the closest by far, and could easily work as the droplet size range for a nasal spray. The other answers are either too large; up to half a millimeter (500 micrometers), or too small; a few nanometres, roughly one micrometer. Again, this question has rather limited feedback and is out of the normal learning objectives, any exam feedback on this question would be appreciated and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com.",

The ear is divided into three sections: the outer, middle and inner ear. OUTER EAR. Collects the vibrations of the air, which then travel through the ear canal (Meatus) leading to the eardrum. Sound waves will cause the eardrum to vibrate. MIDDLE EAR. The outer and middle ear are separated by the eardrum (tympanum). Three small bones, the Ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) are connected to the ear drum and transmit the vibrations across the middle ear to the inner ear. The last bone of the ossicles (the stapes) connects directly to the oval window. Here, a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear. The Eustachian Tube vents to the mouth and nose allowing pressure to equalise across the ear drum. INNER EAR. The diaphragm attached to the oval window causes the fluid (endolymph) in the Cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. Their movement will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound, allowing our brain to translate the tiny pressure waves into sound that we hear. The inner ear also houses the semicircular canals, and these are used for our sense of balance, and are not part of the hearing system. This question is quite complex, so we can go through the other options as well: A) Presbycusis (hearing loss with age) is due to gradual wear of the chain of ossicles. Presbycusis is the hearing loss due to age, but is less to do with the ossicles, and more in relation to the cochlea losing sensitivity in the hairs which stimulate the nerve endings. B) When standing upright, the utriculus senses linear acceleration along the z axis as well as gravity. The utriculus is one of the otoliths (the utriculus and the saccule), which detect accelerations on the body. The utriculus senses horizontal accelerations (so not gravity or z-axis [vertical] accelerations) and the saccule detects gravity and vertical accelerations. C) At the oval window, vibrating the chain of ossicles induces pressure waves in the endolymph. This is written a little backwards, but is just about grammatically correct. Nonetheless, it means that vibrations within the ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) are converted into pressure waves in the endolymph within the cochlea, which is exactly what happens. It is saying that this conversion happens through the oval window, which is also correct. D) The chain of ossicles is in the middle ear and connects the vibrations in the tympanic membrane to the sensors in the semicircular canals. The semicircular canals are balance organs, and do not sense sounds, that happens in the cochlea.",

For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.03.03.14: Describe the problems associated with Type 2 (mostly adult) diabetes: risk factors; insulin resistance; complications (vascular, neurological) and the consequences for the medical licence; pilots are not protected from Type 2 diabetes more than other people. This question requires more feedback to be able to pinpoint the answer the examiners have chosen. It is entirely possible that some of the options are different from the actual exam question, or that different authorities are using slightly different questions with different answers. Let's go through each possible option: A) \"Controlling one’s diet and regular exercise are the most effective treatments, as the type of diabetes cannot be treated with insulin.\" In reality, type II diabetes can be managed through various methods, including lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as medication. While controlling diet and exercise are indeed important components of managing type 2 diabetes and can sometimes be sufficient to control blood sugar levels, many individuals with type II diabetes may also require insulin therapy to effectively manage their condition. Insulin therapy is commonly used when other treatments are not sufficient to control blood sugar levels or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin on its own. B) \"Risk factors include low blood pressure, increasing age, obesity, a diet rich in simple carbohydrates, and a lack of physical exercise\" Low blood pressure is incorrect. A diet rich in simple carbohydrates is often associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while a diet that emphasises complex carbohydrates can help to manage blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing the condition. C) \"A pilot diagnosed with this type of diabetes must be considered unfit, for class 1 medical certification.\" This is not technically true, as the regulations state below that a pilot would usually be assessed as unfit with this condition, but if they are not taking insulin for it, and can demonstrate that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable, they may be able to gain the medical. There has been potentially ambiguous feedback that this answer could be correct, but given the law stated below, we believe it is not correct. D) \"It is usually diagnosed in adulthood, and a typical symptom is unexplained weight loss.\" This answer may be correct. Whether it is a typical symptom or not is difficult to say, we are not doctors, but it is a symptom. Symptoms are not mentioned in the learning objectives, but this does not make it incorrect. Usually diagnosed in adulthood is absolutely correct. Unfortunately, we currently have no feedback on this answer. EASA AIR CREW MED. B.025 Metabolic and Endocrine Systems (a) Applicants with metabolic, nutritional or endocrine dysfunction may be assessed as fit subject to demonstrated stability of the medical condition and satisfactory aero-medical evaluation. (b) Diabetes mellitus (1) Applicants with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit. (2) Applicants with diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin shall be assessed as unfit unless it can be demonstrated that blood sugar control has been achieved and is stable. (c) Aero-medical assessment (1) Applicants for a class 1 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be referred to the medical assessor of the licensing authority. (2) The fitness of applicants for a class 2 medical certificate requiring medication other than insulin for blood sugar control shall be assessed in consultation with the medical assessor of the licensing authority. We cannot be sure of the validity of any such feedback, and there are many places where the feedback can be miscommunicated or mistaken. As such, any further exam feedback would be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com",

HYPERVENTILATION Breathing too rapidly or too deeply can cause hyperventilation, a physiological disorder that develops when too much carbon dioxide (CO2) is eliminated from the body. Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level. When we undertake physical activity our body cells use more Oxygen and this in turn produces more CO2. This excess CO2 enters the blood and consequently our breathing increases in depth and rate to remove it.",

To adjust to the new time zone, the circadian system has to advance, or shift forward, or move earlier. This question is quite problematic because it lacks key information - the correct answer will depend on whether the crew is staying for 24 h or less or if they are staying for longer. In the case of short stays, to reduce the effects of jetlag, the crew should keep things as they are by seeking bright light in the evening and keeping the curtains closed in the morning. However, for longer stays, the crew should adapt to the new time zone as soons as possible. Flying to the East, the duration of daylight is shorter, therefore the perceived daylight is shorter. Since the day is shorter, you'll have to go to bed earlier. Consequently, one should avoid bright light in the evening and seek bright light as early as possible in the morning.

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular accelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, weakness (loss of muscular power), feeling and being sick, tiredness and confusion, stomach pain, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, heartbeat, cardiac arrest, seizures, blurred vision, disorientation, loss of consciousness, coma, respiratory failure and death",

The hormone called insulin is responsible for breaking down glucose (sugar) and insulin is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin at all (Type 1) or when the insulin produced does not work properly (Type 2). There are two main types of Diabetes: Type I. This happens when there is no insulin to break down sugar. It typically occurs in younger persons. The risk of developing this type of diabetes is usually related to one’s genes and ethnicity, which are factors that cannot be controlled Type II. This happens when the insulin produced by the pancreas does not work properly. It typically occurs in persons over the age of 40. The risk of developing this type of diabetes increases with a lack of regular exercise, weight gain and a poor diet amongst other factors such as genetics. Up to 80 per cent of cases of Type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by making simple changes in one’s lifestyle including adopting a healthy diet, undertaking regular exercise and controlling one’s weight.",

In this system the individual is given two points for every hour spent asleep and has one point deducted for every hour spent awake. This is only a rough measure, as individuals vary considerably in the amount of sleep they require. The maximum credit available is 16 points. You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. When a person is required to be awake longer than the credit situation allows, a sleep debit situation will develop. If possible, the following sleep cycle will then be longer than 8 hours to rebuild the full 16 hours of sleep credit. While a short sleep debit will usually not cause any remarkable effects in healthy persons, sleep debit can become cumulative and result in reduced vigilance and performance, with an increased susceptibility to sensory illusions. This problem is very common when forced to work days (or nights) in a row with little time in between that to be used for building up sleep credit. Jet lag/circadian disrhythmia - occurs when conducting transmeridian long-distance flights where shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. Most likely, this question does not refer to long-haul flights but rather short-haul operations, where the crew always returns to base and no shifts occur in the rhythm of night and day. The question possibly describes a situation of situational insomnia (inability to sleep due to disrupted work/rest patterns, or circadian dysrhythmia) rather than chronic insomnia (long-term pattern of difficulty sleeping).",

This is only a rough measure, as individuals vary considerably in the amount of sleep they require. The maximum credit available is 16 points. You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. The fewer points you have the readier you are to sleep. Normally the person will sleep when he/she has little or no credit and will sleep for about 8 hours, followed by a wakeful period of about sixteen hours when the sleep credit will be exhausted.

If you are hyperventilating, you might experience drowsiness, tingling sensation in the fingers and toes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, blurred vision and feelings of suffocation. In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level. Realistically, this is very easy, as both statements are effectively the same, so 1 is correct, 2 is correct.",

External Respiration: External respiration refers to the gas exchange between the alveoli and blood capillaries of the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into the blood during external respiration. Carbon dioxide diffuses out from the blood into the alveolar air during external respiration. The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate.

This may cause you to reenter the original attitude.

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

            "explanation": "SMOKING AND HYPOXIA Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

On the 25th of October 1999, a SunJet Aviation Learjet 35 crashed in South Dakota, after 4 hour ghost flight through US airspace. This happened because the flight crew was busy troubleshooting the cabin pressure system and never thought of ensuring oxygen supply. After the accident, a recommendation was issued and made a legal requirement that all decompression emergency checklists stated \"Don oxygen mask\" as the first item. Once the flight crew is safe against the symptoms of hypoxia, the subsequent steps differ with aircraft type and operator. Two important steps are: inform ATC; and initiate an emergency descent to a safe altitude, preferably to an altitude below 10 000 ft. In multicrew aircrafts, both actions will usually be about parallel - the pilot flying starts the descent and the pilot monitoring signals their descent. Informing ATC as soon as reasonably possible is useful for pilots because ATC can assist by clearing their way and offering vectors.",

When you breathe too fast or too deep and carbon dioxide levels drop too low, the pH of the blood rises and becomes too alkaline. This disturbance of the acid balance has a number of effects, the major one being that haemoglobin gives up its oxygen readily only in an acid medium. As a result, tissues suffer from lack of O2. Some causes of sudden hyperventilation include anxiety, fear, severe pain, fever, some medicines, intense exercise, and emotional stress. Note: The aim of pressure breathing is to create a higher pressure and thus better oxygen diffusion in your lungs; for example, by exhaling through pursed lips. The technique has to be trained, because it can lead unintentional, faster than required respirationm and excessive loss of carbon dioxide. Thus if not executed correctly, pressure breathing can cause hyperventilation.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Student feedback has confirmed the present correct answer to this question. Our interpretation suggests that the examiner is emphasizing safeguarding against insects and mosquito bites, rather than addressing endemic intestinal disorders and bacterial transmission in tropical climates and underdeveloped countries. Tropical climates introduce a range of challenges for pilots and travelers to account for. The high temperatures are just one facet of the equation. Additionally, many less economically developed countries are situated within this region. Within these economically disadvantaged nations, inadequate hygiene and sanitation pose significant issues. Pathogens are transmitted by insects that act as carriers, transporting them from one host to another. Mosquitoes and other biting insects extract blood from animals and humans alike. Attracted by exhaled carbon dioxide, body heat, and skin, mosquitoes pose an unwelcome reality for those journeying to tropical and other warm climates. Fortunately, a variety of straightforward measures can be adopted to minimize the likelihood of insect bites: Opt for fully covering attire, including long trousers, long-sleeve shirts, and socks. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. Steer clear of outdoor activities during dawn and dusk (early morning and evening). Eliminate sources of stagnant water in the vicinity, as mosquitoes tend to breed there. Employ insect nets and screens to prevent insects from entering. Utilize a fan or air-conditioner to maintain air circulation, thereby impeding their flight It is recommended to wear appropriate clothing - Long-sleeved shirts and long trousers are a must in malaria zones. Exposed skin should be protected with insect repellents; the head and neck must be protected from direct exposure to the sun.",

Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing even if the patient appears to have recovered.",

Diabetes, stress and alcohol are related to hypertension. Diabetes damages arteries and makes them targets for hardening, called atherosclerosis. That can cause high blood pressure. Your body produces a surge of hormones when you're in a stressful situation. These hormones temporarily increase your blood pressure by causing your heart to beat faster and your blood vessels to narrow. Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily raises your blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increases.",

The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly?

            "explanation": "The four statements include aviation examples for four forms of hypoxia: “1. Malfunction of the body cells to metabolize oxygen.” CORRECT. This statement refers to histoxic hypoxia - which happens at the cell level. This means that the cell expecting and needing the oxygen is impaired and cannot use the oxygen to support metabolism. Alcohol, narcotics, and cyanide are three primary factors that can cause histoxic hypoxia. “2. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere when flying at high altitudes without pressurization and supplemental oxygen.” CORRECT. This statement refers to hypoxic hypoxia - the most common form of hypoxia encountered in aviation and occurs at the lung level. Pilots may experience hypoxic hypoxia when flying at altitude in an unpressurized aircraft. With increasing altitude, the molecules of oxygen in ambient air get farther apart and exert less pressure per square inch. The percentage of oxygen does not change as we ascend; however, the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient air decreases as we go to altitude. In other words, with increasing altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen gets lower and the lungs cannot effectively transfer oxygen from the ambient air to the blood to be carried to all tissues in the body. \"3. A decreased saturation of oxygen in the blood due to carbon monoxide attached to the haemoglobin.\" CORRECT. This statement refers to Anaemic/Hypemic hypoxia - caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen but the most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected.

Vertigo develops when a person experiences a mismatch between spatial information from the eyes, vestibular system, and proprioceptors. Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Head movements should be minimised to allow the brain to readjust to the actual spatial situation without causing additional confusion. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control. Body feedback will be wrong and only by reference to the aircraft instruments can safe control of the aircraft be maintained.",

This can lead the pilot to believe they are too high and result in a lower approach, potentially causing the aircraft to land before reaching the runway. To counter this illusion, pilots should be aware that when approaching an upsloping runway, they may feel higher than their actual altitude. Therefore, it is advisable to plan for a longer landing on the runway to compensate for this perception. A DOWNSLOPING RUNWAY can create the illusion that the aircraft is lower than it actually is, leading to a higher approach. This can cause the pilot to misjudge their altitude as too low and result in a higher approach, potentially overshooting the runway. To counter this illusion, pilots should anticipate the sensation of being too low when flying towards a downsloping runway. They should plan for a shorter landing, aiming to touch down before reaching the end of the runway. During an approach to an upsloping runway, the illusion of being too high is created and the pilot tends to fly lower. To avoid this error, the pilot should keep a higher visual glideslope than normal (he/she should feel higher) in order to fly on the correct actual glideslope. However, a student received the following answer from the authority: \"If your approach angle is meant to be 3, for example, and the runway is already sloping up by 1, you will think you are higher than you actually are and increase the rate of descent and land short. This can be corrected by flying lower at a shallower angle.\"",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

Rods: They are found in the periphery of retina and they enable scotopic (low-light) vision. The rods can only create black and white images and are also responsible for peripheral vision. 2. Cones: The fovea, at the retina's center, contains only cones that enable photopic (bright-light) vision. The cones are responsible for direct vision and require bright light to function. They are used to detect colours. The cones are located at the center of the retina (fovea area). During daytime the light should focus there in order to receive clear images. Away from the fovea, the clarity of the images produced by the cones reduces rapidly. The cones do not provide peripheral vision capability. This means that in order to see a target clearly during daytime, the target has to be at the center of your field of vision. That is the reason why scanning of the sky is necessary. The recommended scanning technique is to divide the sky in sectors of 10 degrees each, and spend 1 second to scan each segment.",

It does this by controlling the size of the pupil - In low light, your pupils open up, or dilate, to let in more light. When it's bright, they get smaller, or constrict, to let in less light. After passing through the pupil, the light passes through a clear lens. Its shape is changed by the muscles (ciliary muscles) surrounding it which allow the final focusing onto the fovea - In order to focus clearly on a near object, the lens is thickened. To focus on a distant point, the lens is flattened. This focused light is directed onto the retina, a thin layer of light-sensitive nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye. Images are focused at its center (known as the macula) and converted into electrical impulses that are carried to the brain by the optic nerve, where they are translated into sight. The retina is composed of cones ans rods: CONES are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of colour vision and are responsible for high spatial acuity. The central fovea is populated exclusively by cones. RODS are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, being able to detect black and white only. The maximum density of rods is found about 10° from the fovea. Thus making them responsible for our peripheral vision. Rods are also sensitive to movement and the movement of an object to the side of us is quickly picked up.",

When taking off and flying with visual references, it is important to maintain a good view of the horizon, as this is how we set our attitude. In a snowstorm, the visibility can be massively reduced, but also, the human eyes struggle to look through the storm as well, as it is often very bright, and every snowflake is moving around, etc. White-out is more of a term used by helicopter pilots when landing or taking off in snow (or sometimes sand or dust), where they become encircled by the snow and lose visibility very quickly, but it can also be where the visibility drops in heavy snowfall. The only correct option here is that the pilot loses their horizon, and therefore does not know which way is up/down (sky/ground). This would be a major hazard, and is one of the reasons that VFR flight must never be made in IMC. The option about getting lost could be an issue during the flight, but not during take-off, and losing the horizon is a much worse scenario.",

Proprioception, for instance, can be misleading when flying in clouds, creating confusion about position and movement. Consequently, pilots must use cockpit and flight-deck instruments when flying in such conditions. In daylight and good weather, visual orientation dominates perception. However, in IFR conditions or at night, limited visual cues compel the body to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive inputs. These inputs can generate erroneous orientation cues, heightening the risk of spatial disorientation.

This causes the eyes to relax and seek a comfortable focal distance which may range from 10 to 30 feet. For the pilot, this means looking without seeing, which is dangerous. In other words, it is a condition in which the eyes, having nothing specific within the available visual field upon which to focus, focus automatically at a range of the order of a few metres ahead. Detection of objects outside this restricted field of view is delayed and if an object of interest does enter the restricted field of vision, the determination of its size or range would be problematic.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

The centre of the retina is called the fovea and the receptors in this area are all cones. Moving outwards, the cones become less dense and are gradually replaced by rods - in the periphery there are no cones. CONES. used for direct vision and are colour-sensitive; RODS. the maximum density of rods is found about 10º from the fovea - rods are responsible for our peripheral vision. The rods can only detect black and white but are much more sensitive at lower light levels. As light decreases, the sensing task is passed over from the cones to the rods. => In dim light it is easier to focus on an object if you look slightly away from it. As the fovea contains no rods, which would be required for vision is very low brightness levels, the centre part of the eye becomes blind to dim light. It is then necessary to look away from the visual target so that the peripherally located rods can perform their sensing task. To check the other options given: Peripheral Vision is vision far away from the centre, \"in the corner of your eye\", but is not changed significantly by the darkness adjustment process. Grey-out is a term used when a person is losing blood to their brain and eyes, during a sustained high positive G manouvre, their vision becomes grey, and forms a tunnel. Sensitivity is correct as that is what is changing to allow us to see in darker conditions, the sensitivity of our rods increase during this adjustment period to pick up low light levels, versus the cones which cannot see in the dark, so become less sensitive. Binocular cues are things within our visual range that allow us to judge depth perception, and have nothing to do with night vision adaptation.",

            "explanation": "Eustachian tubes are small tubes that run between the middle ears and the upper throat. They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher, the Valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (angular accelerations). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Because the eyes can focus only on this narrow viewing area, effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field.

Depth perception arises from a variety of depth cues. These are typically classified into binocular cues (based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes) and monocular cues (represented in just two dimensions and observed with just one eye). Binocular cues rely on the slight differences in the view seen by each eye to perceive objects. Therefore, binocular perception is only effective when the object is sufficiently close to cause noticeable differences in the viewing angle of both eyes. However, during flight, the distances outside the cockpit are generally vast, rendering binocular cues less useful. Compared to monocular cues, binocular cues operate at a subconscious level. Monocular cues include: Geometric perspective. Motion parallax. Retinal image size. Aerial perspective. An individual with one eye absolutely blind will not receive the binocular depth cues, but will receive the monocular depth cues (cues observed with one eye). Monocular cues will provide the individual with a partial understanding of depth perception.",

Ozone is a gas that is naturally present in our atmosphere. Each ozone molecule contains three atoms of oxygen and is denoted chemically as O3. Ozone is found primarily in two regions of the atmosphere. About 10% of atmospheric ozone is in the troposphere, the region closest to Earth (from the surface up to about 10–16 kilometres[FL320-FL520]). The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude. The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.” The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans, as is also detailed in the Meteorology learning objectives. Usually, for modern transport jets, the higher they climb, the higher the ozone exposure. Even though it is quoted as being hazardous to humans, in reality, the quantities at modern cruising altitudes are not enough to cause any real harm, especially as most aircraft are fitted with ozone filters that will remove the majority of it from the cabin air. This allows us to bring the ozone concentration that is breathed in down below the prescribed limits. The other options are wrong as it is nothing to do with clouds, it is not more concentrated at low levels, and solar flares actually remove ozone from the layer, instead of creating more.",

Hypoxia can be caused by several factors including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. A healthy person is normally able to compensate for altitudes up to approximately 10000 - 12000 ft. An insidious characteristic of hypoxia is that its early (and probably the most dangerous) symptom include euphoria (false sense of well being). This can prevent the pilot from recognizing a potentially hazardous situation because it puts him/her in such a state of mind that individual well being, as well as that of the passengers, is a low priority. You should remain alert for the other symptoms of hypoxia such as headache, increased response time, impaired judgement, drowsiness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes, numbness, blue fingernails and lips (cyanosis), visual disturbances, lack of concentration, fatigue and limp muscles. The speed and order of appearance of signs, and the severity of symptoms, produced by breathing air at altitude depend on the individual. Even if you learn the early symptoms of hypoxia, do not assume that you will be able to take corrective action whenever they occur. Because when the brain starts to feel the effects of hypoxia, the higher reasoning portion of the brain is the first affected. This means that judgment and cognitive skills diminish from the very start.",

Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. Vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision. \"3. Acceleration\" CORRECT. As g-forces increase, visual effects include loss of colour vision (\"grey-out\"), followed by tunnel vision (where peripheral vision is lost, retaining only the centre vision). If g-forces increase further, complete loss of vision will occur, while consciousness remains. These effects are due to a reduction of blood flow to the eyes. The reverse effect is experienced under negative g-forces, where excess blood moves towards the brain and eyes \"red-out\". \"4. Toxic influence (alcohol, some medication)\" CORRECT. Drug and alcohol use impact the central nervous system. It can affect the way the brain processes images or affect the eye muscles themselves. Excessive drinking can lead to blurred vision and even damage to the optic nerves.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

When breathing 100% oxygen, the partial pressure of oxygen is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at that altitude. The difference between pressurized and non-pressurized aircraft in terms of oxygen partial pressure and altitude stems from how cabin pressure is managed. Pressurized aircraft maintain a higher cabin pressure, simulating a lower altitude (6000 - 8000 ft) up to approximately 35 000 ft, which makes it easier to achieve the MSL oxygen partial pressure at high altitudes. In non-pressurized aircraft, supplemental oxygen becomes necessary at much lower altitudes because the cabin pressure follows the external atmospheric pressure, leading to a lower partial pressure of oxygen. Breathing 100% oxygen at 8000 ft corresponds to the partial pressure of oxygen at MSL. For a pressurized aircraft: 34 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL 38 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 8000 ft 40 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 10 000 ft 45 000 ft breathing 100% O2 = 20 000 ft For a non-pressurised aircraft: 8000 ft breathing 100% O2 = MSL",

Your body will also require more pressure to move this blood around. High blood pressure is also a common cause of heart attack, which are sadly more common for obese individuals. Obesity can lead to diabetes. Individuals with diabetes are said to be two to four times more likely to be at risk for heart disease. It can also lead to high levels of cholesterol. The main risk associated with high cholesterol is coronary heart disease. \"2. Chronic stress\" CORRECT. Your body’s response to stress is supposed to protect you. But, if it's constant, it can harm you. The hormone cortisol is released in response to stress. Studies suggest that the high levels of cortisol from long-term stress can increase blood cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar, and blood pressure. These are common risk factors for heart disease. This stress can also cause changes that promote the buildup of plaque deposits in the arteries. \"3. Low blood pressure\" INCORRECT. Coronary aretery disease are generally associated with high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop coronary artery disease, because high blood pressure puts added force against the artery walls. Over time, this extra pressure can damage the arteries, making them more vulnerable to the narrowing and plaque buildup. \"4. Family history\" CORRECT.

Using 2 eyes for sight is very beneficial, not only does it allow for removal of the blind spot of each eye (caused by the optical nerve), but it also provides us with binocular vision, which allows our brain to interpret depth perception at short to medium distances. Depth perception is the ability to see things in three dimensions (including length, width and depth), and to judge how far away an object is. Depth perception arises from a variety of depth cues. These are typically classified into binocular cues, based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes, and monocular cues, that can be represented in just two dimensions and observed with just one eye. Monocular cues include: relative size (distant objects subtend smaller visual angles than near objects); texture gradient; occlusion and obscuration; linear and aerial/atmospheric perspective; contrast differences; and motion parallax. Therefore, when someone loses their eyesight in a single eye (but the other remains serviceable), they will lose their binocular depth perception cues, but they will still have some depth perception cues, due to monocular cues.",

            "explanation": "This is a really lengthy question with lots of words to try and confuse you. We are currently unsure of the wording, so please let us know if you get this question in your exam and whatever you are able to remember about it, thank you! The question is referring to the coriolis illusion. This is what we feel when our semicircular canals all sense movement at once, which the brain cannot explain. It is quite a bit more complex than this, but for our purposes, it is what happens when a pilot bends down to pick up a pen during a turn. The pilot's vestibular senses have become accustomed to the turn, but when the pilot's head moves and rotates, the equilibrium in all the semicircular canals is disrupted immediately. This leads to dizziness, a tumbling sensation and significant disorientation, particularly if visual reference is lost. The best way to fix these symptoms is to minimise head movements and fixate on the external visual situation or the instruments to allow the brain to understand the situation. Let's go through each option: \"Without any outside visual references, the interaction between their individual senses becomes disturbed by nodding their head while the device is rotating.\" This is correct. \"the interaction between individual senses\" is referring to the different semicircular canals all getting simultaneous angular accelerations at once, which the brain cannot handle. It is important to notice also that this option mentions that nodding the head whilst the device is rotating causes this illusion, and this is because those rotations are occurring around different axes. Just one rotation would quickly get understood by the particular semicircular canal, but when equilibrium has been reached (device spinning), then a different rotation is introduced, all the canals experience new angular accelerations, and without visual reference, the brain gets immediately disorientated. \"The dizziness and disorientation is caused solely by the rotation of the device without external visual reference, the nodding of the head does not influence this effect.\" No. As mentioned above, the head nodding on a different axis to the device spinning causes the illusion, the spinning is not enough on its own. \"The process of interpreting vestibular sensations in the brain's cerebral cortex is adversely affected by the pilot nodding their head, leading to disorientation.\" The process of interpreting vestibular sensations does not occur in the cerebral cortex, and it is not the interpretation that is disrupted, it is the physical movements within the semicircular canals. \"The nodding of the head disturbs the equilibrium of all the sensory inputs. This can be compensated for by the brain for a certain time, after which, disorientation will begin.\" As far as we can tell, the brain cannot \"compensate\" for the coriolis illusion at all, the effects are immediate. We are also unsure about the wording of this option in the real exam, so it may be different than it is here.",

They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear, the part of the ear behind the eardrum. The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). During descent the danger is higher because the air in the middle ear is at a lower pressure than the cabin, closing the Eustachian tube and preventing pressure equalisation, the valsalva manoeuvre might have to be performed. If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears.",

Most commonly it arises from changes in the inner ear of a person as he or she ages, but presbycusis can also result from changes in the middle ear or from complex changes along the nerve pathways leading to the brain.

RODS are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate colour vision, being able to detect black and white only. The maximum density of rods is found about 10° from the fovea. Thus making them responsible for our peripheral vision. Rods are also sensitive to movement and the movement of an object to the side of us is quickly picked up. Rods and cones are the nerve endings of the optic nerve. Thus, as an extension of the brain. Vision is therefore the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL.

The sleeper is in a very light sleep. It is a transitional phase between waking and sleeping; if woken at this stage, the sleeper may claim that he/she has not even been asleep. In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

In manufacturing, cyanide is used to make plastics. Cyanide is a potentially deadly chemical which prevents the exchange of oxygen between blood and tissues, resulting in suffocation. \"Anti-icing fluids\" INCORRECT. Anti-icing fluid gives off fumes which, if allowed to enter the fuselage, can be harmful. But please note that this question asks about aircraft fires, hence anti-ice answer is not correct. \"Hydraulic fluids\" are considered fire resistant but can sustain combustion. When burning, hydraulic fluid will release roxic fluids. \"Fire extinguishers made of steel\" is clearly the least likely option.",

            ],
            "explanation": "ALCOHOL Alcohol is not digested in the body but is absorbed directly into the bloodstream, from the stomach and from the intestines. Once in the blood, it is transported throughout the body. The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour, though this can vary between individuals. One unit is equivalent to about half a pint of beer (0.2 liters), a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirits. On average, alcohol is eliminated from the blood at a rate of approximately 0.015% blood-alcohol concentration per hour. Drinking 1½ pints of beer or three shots of whiskey would raise the blood alcohol level to around 45-50 mg/100 ml, meaning it could take up to four hours for the alcohol to be fully metabolized. The rate of alcohol elimination can vary depending on factors like the type of alcohol consumed (fizzy drinks speed up absorption), body weight, food intake, and individual metabolic differences, with body weight being a particularly significant factor. Let's examine the options given: 'Male pilots can withstand better alcohol effect than female pilots due to an average higher body mass'. INCORRECT. Alcohol tolerance does not depend solely on body mass. Age, physical health, drinking habits and genetics are some other factors that could affect alcohol tolerance. 'Alcohol effects disappears completely when a pilot does not drink alcohol for more than 3 days'. INCORRECT. On average, the body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour. However, the effects of alcohol on the body may not completely disappear after metabolizing it. Factors like individual metabolism, hydration, and overall health play crucial roles in how long alcohol's effects linger. 'An average person of 75 kg will assimilate alcohol with a rate of 0.015% per hour, which is a 0.2 liter beer'. CORRECT. The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly one unit per hour, though this can vary between individuals. One unit is equivalent to about half a pint of beer (0.2 liters), a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirits. On average, alcohol is eliminated from the blood at a rate of approximately 0.015% blood-alcohol concentration per hour. 'No option is correct, everyone can drink as much alcohol as he/she can withstand'. INCORRECT. Alcohol affects judgment, coordination, and reaction times. Drinking large amounts of alcohol, even if someone feels they can \"withstand\" it, can lead to alcohol poisoning.",

This is most apparent in the face, where the skin can be seen to sag. Since the weight of the body may be increased many times while the power of the muscles remains unaltered, movements become progressively more difficult. If the head is lowered, it may not be possible to raise it again. A pressure gradient develops in the blood between the heart and the brain, resulting in reduced blood pressure at head level. This can reduce the supply of oxygen to the eye and brain, ultimately leading to G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC). The blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lower parts of the body rises with increasing G, and flow of blood back to the heart is reduced. The high blood pressure in parts of the body below heart level can be sufficient to rupture small capillaries in the feet and forearms, leaving a fine rash (‘G measles’). As the level of acceleration is increased, inadequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to the retina causes partial loss of vision ('grey-out'). It also induces a tunnelling of vision as the eye cells at the edge of the retina, being furthest from the blood supply, suffer first. Followed by total loss of vision ('black-out'). Ultimately, it can lead to unconsciousness. Recovery from unconsciousness is frequently associated with jerky and uncontrolled movements of the head and limbs.",

Among healthy adults, the average lung capacity is about 4.2 l of air (women) and 6 l (men). However, the volume of air inhaled and exhaled (tidal volume) with each normal breath is only about 500 ml. Beyond the normal tidal volume, the extra amount of air which can be inhaled (Inspiratory Reserve Volume) is about 1900 ml/3000 ml. The Expiratory Reserve Volume is the amount of air that can be still exhaled by forceful expiration after the end of the normal tidal expiration and it is about 700 ml/1100 ml. The air that is always left in the lungs and can never be exhaled, even after the most forceful expiration, is about 1100 ml/1200 ml. Gas exchange takes place in the alveolis in the lungs and the capillaries that envelop them. Inhaled oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries, and carbon dioxide, that was produced by cells as a waste product, moves from the blood in the capillaries to the air in the alveoli to be exhaled. Thus, exhaled air contains more CO2 than inspired air (which contains more O2). This gas exchange is based on the law of diffusion. Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of gases, without the use of any energy or effort by the body, where the gases will move from the area of high pressure into the area of lower pressure. Thus, rate of diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2).",

Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high.

But there are a few things to consider: Aircrews spend much of their flying time at cabin altitudes of 8 000 ft. At these altitudes, substantially less oxygen is available relative to sea level. Since the amount of oxygen passing through a contact lens is directly related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding air (the cornea does not have its own blood supply), the amount of oxygen available under a contact lens will also diminish at higher altitudes. In addition, low cabin humidities may dehydrate soft lenses, inducing a further decrease in oxygen available beneath these lenses by as much as 15 percent. Such reductions in oxygen availability may result in hypoxia with consequent corneal edema and other stresses to ocular physiology.",

            "explanation": "Blind Spot Visual information from the retina is transported to the brain through the optic nerve. This is the point at the back of the eye where all the nerve fibres meet and form the nerve. This section of the retina does not contain photosensitive cells. Light that falls on the retina in this spot cannot be processed into visual impressions, so objects that are projected onto this area cannot be seen. This blind spot is most problematic when vision from the other eye is partially or fully obscured, as that extra eye is usually what would fill in the blank section of vision, hence the reason we do not notice our blind spot in everyday life. If a pilot is looking in one direction with one eye obscured, there is a good chance that they would not see an aircraft on a constant relative bearing (stationary in the windshield) if it happens to lie within the blind spot of the working eye, meaning that the pilot may not be aware of the problem until it has come so close that its depiction is larger than the blind spot – which will most likely be too late to avoid a collision. This could be avoided by using a constant scan, to make sure the blind spot area is not always in the same place. Therefore, in this question, there needs to be both an obscured view (so both eyes cannot see the approaching aircraft), and the aircraft must be in a constant place in the windshield, for the worst case scenario to be realised. The pilot must also have fixed vision (not scanning), as scanning would likely reveal the oncoming aircraft. This leads us to the correct answer.",

You cannot store credit points above 16 in anticipation of a long period awake. The fewer points you have the readier you are to sleep.

(Sleep hours = half the time of being awake) If one has lost 4 h of sleep, he/she will need 4 h of sleep to balance. (Sleep hours missed = sleep hours needed)",

            "explanation": "SMOKING AND HYPOXIA Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

The otoliths consist of the utricles chambers that senses linear accelerations and the saccules chambers that sense gravity (vertical acceleration. Semicircular canals: The semicircular canals of the inner ear are three canals filled with fluid that are perpendicular to each other. Inside the canals there are fine hair-like cells which bend during angular accelerations. The superior canal senses acceleration in the pitch axis, the posterior canal measures acceleration in the roll axis and the horizontal canal measures acceleration in the roll axis. Vestibular Apparatus: Otoliths ⇒ Linear acceleration and gravity Semicircular canals ⇒ Angular acceleration (roll, pitch, yaw)",

Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing even if the patient appears to have recovered.",

Your senses are tricked, so they deliver conflicting information to the central nervous system. Vertigo does not develop in a sensory organ but in the CNS, which cannot make sense of the combination of sensory inputs. Under VMC, the horizon is a reference the pilot can trust. There is only one action that will overcome vertigo upon entering IFR conditions. The pilot must immediately transition to flight instruments to determine the aircraft’s attitude and respond accordingly to maintain aircraft control.

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels.

Hypertension adds to your heart's workload and damages your arteries and organs over time. Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure. Poor lifestyle habits, such as a lack of exercise, can lead to high blood pressure. Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. As a result, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. As a recommendation, exercise must be regular and sufficient to raise the resting pulse rate by 100% for at least 20 minutes, three times a week.",

These bubbles produce a variety of symptoms, which range from pain in the large joints of the body, such as elbows, shoulders, hips, wrists, knees and ankles, to seizures and unconsciousness. These symptoms tend to increase in severity depending on the rate and amount of pressure change and, if severe enough, can result in death. Bends. Bubbles in the joints which cause rheumatic-like pains. Movement or rubbing the affected parts only aggravates the pain but descent usually solves the problem. The most common symptom of DCS. Creeps. Nitrogen bubbles released under the skin causes the sufferer to feel that a small compact colony of ants are crawling over or under the skin. Chokes. Nitrogen bubbles are caught in the capillaries of the lungs, blocking the pulmonary blood flow causing serious shortness of breath. Staggers. The bubbles affect the blood supply to the brain and nervous system. If DCS symptoms occur in any crew member or passenger, the pilot should immediately commence a descent to a level at which the symptoms are relieved, and the aircraft should land as soon as possible. (This will require the crew to declare a mayday in most cases). The sufferer should be put onto a 100% oxygen supply and urgent medical assistance must be sought on landing. There is a very high risk of getting decompression sickness after scuba diving, where the ambient pressure is very high, and then soon after travelling on an aircraft where the pressure becomes much lower, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the body, causing the above symptoms.",

The most common causes of conductive deafness are temporary, as the blocking element can be removed. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex.

            "explanation": "Any medication can cause side effects, some of which may impair the safe performance of performing aviation safety related duties. Equally, symptoms of colds, sore throats, diarrhoea and other abdominal upsets may cause little or no problem whilst on the ground but may distract the pilot or cabin crew member and degrade their performance whilst on duty. The in-flight environment may also increase the severity of symptoms which may only be minor whilst on the ground. Therefore, one issue with medication and performing aviation safety related duties is the underlying condition and, in addition, the symptoms may be compounded by the side effects of the medication prescribed or bought over the counter for treatment. The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly? \"2. Flight conditions may modify the reactions of the body to a treatment.\" CORRECT. The lower partial pressure of oxygen, along with the low humidity in an aircraft cabin (increase in water loss), have effects on the body metabolism. Therefore, medication may, for instance, be metabolised slower and accumulate in the blood, causing more severe side effects than on the ground. \"3. The licence holder is prohibited from flying when taking any prescribed medicine.\" INCORRECT. Not all prescribed medicine is incompatible with flying. However, you should seek expert aero-medical advice, especially if you believe that such medication may impair the safe performance of performing aviation safety related duties.",

HEARING LOSS Hearing loss can be broadly separated into two categories: conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss results when there is any problem in delivering sound energy from the sound waves in the ear canal to your cochlea, the hearing part in the inner ear. The natural movement of sound through the external ear or middle ear becomes blocked or dampened in some way, and the full sound does not reach the cochlea. Common reasons for conductive hearing loss are blockages in the outer ear (earwax or other), damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane), damage to (or displacement of) the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), and any other damage or foreign objects that reduce or distort the sound that passes through to the cochlea. The most common causes of conductive deafness are blockages, which can be removed (or will be removed over time with infections), and are therefore temporary. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex. These could be noise induced hearing loss, presbycusis, etc. Note: Cerumen is another term for earwax.",

Water vapour is added to the cabin environment during respiration, but as the air is continually replaced this will have a limited effect in increasing the cabin humidity. It is paramount that a person compensates for this very low humidity by drinking sufficient fluids in flight to avoid dehydration - thrist is a late symptom of dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration may include headache, feeling dizzy or lightheaded and muscle cramps. Remember that even slight dehydration can cause a reduction in performance. It is also important to recall that caffeine and alcoholic beverages actually contribute to dehydration.

A pilot relying on these inputs is sometimes referred to as flying by the “seat-of-the-pants”. Under VMC, the proprioceptive (seat-of-the-pants) sense can be quite helpful. Without ever noticing, we use our proprioceptive sense in everyday life to finetune our movements. In VMC, this sense can give us valuable additional information that can help us finetune our motor actions. But proprioception can only be helpful in combination with vision. Under IMC, the pilot loses vital visual input and the seat-of-pants is no longer able to tell the cause of a sensed pressure and will not provide any valuable data. For instance, if the aircraft goes into a descent it will accelerate and this acceleration, via the otoliths, will inform the pilot that the aircraft is in a climb. The proprioceptors will also detect a climb. Therefore, this system becomes unreliable for lack of visual support and must not be used for spatial orientation. Pilots must rely on the aircraft instruments to avoid disorientation.",

As your heart pumps, it forces blood out through arteries that carry the blood throughout your body. There are two types of blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure refers to the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping; diastolic pressure is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between beats. Blood pressure (BP) is recorded with the systolic number first, followed by the diastolic number. For example, a normal blood pressure would be recorded as something under 120/80 mm Hg.",

If it is over 25, you are overweight, and over 30, you are obese. The normal range is between 18.5 to 25 for men and 19 to 24 for women. Being overweight is one of the common causes of back pain, especially in the lower back. However, this statement is referring to a \"normal weight\". \"2. different length of the lower extremities\" CORRECT. Those who suffer from functional leg length discrepancy are those who tend to suffer from lower back pain. The side that appears shorter often has a “lateral pelvic tilt and a shortening of the lateral flexor muscles.” This sideways pull increases compression on the facet joints for the short side and decreases the space between the vertebra which can lead to pinched nerves (sciatica). \"3. slipped intervertebral disc\" CORRECT. A slipped disc is when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out. It's painful if it presses on nerves. A 'slipped' (prolapsed) disc often causes sudden, severe lower back pain. \"4. muscular tension and fatigue of the back muscles.\" CORRECT. This statement is describing a muscular back pain. A person can treat muscle fatigue and reduce discomfort in the lower back with rest, hot or cold therapy, over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and naproxen and gentle exercises to stretch and loosen tight muscles.",

Symptoms of hypoxia typically develop slowly at lower altitudes but accelerate quickly at higher altitudes. In the altitude band of 10 000 ft to 12 000 ft, the compensatory reactions of the body are not powerful enough to ensure full operation and performance will be reduced to a point where it might interfere with the safety of the flight.

Our kinaesthetic perception relies on our somatosensory (whole body) system to detect touch and pressure, combined with our vestibular system (the inner ear) to detect movement. In most normal earthbound activities, when combined with sight and hearing, this can be fully relied on to help us perceive the world accurately. However, flying, and especially piloting presents situations and environments in which we cannot fully rely on (trust) our kinaesthetic perception; especially when visual and auditory data is also unavailable. Auditory illusions are false perceptions of a real sound or outside stimulus. These false perceptions are the equivalent of an optical illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or sounds that should not be possible given the circumstance on how they were created.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide. Carbon Monoxide is produced by incomplete combustion, so wherever there is fire, carbon monoxide will also be present, in some quantity or another. This is why it is particularly possible for Carbon Monoxide to enter the cockpits of light aircraft, which are located so close to aero piston engines, and heated using a heat exchanger with exhaust gasses.",

            "explanation": "HYPERVENTILATION Breathing too rapidly or too deeply can cause hyperventilation, a physiological disorder that develops when too much carbon dioxide (CO2) is eliminated from the body. Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. If you are hyperventilating, you might experience drowsiness, tingling sensation in the fingers and toes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, blurred vision and feelings of suffocation. In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

As a result, the recorded combination of 160/60 is classified as hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) is the force exerted by your blood against your arteries. As your heart pumps, it forces blood out through arteries that carry the blood throughout your body. There are two types of blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure refers to the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping; diastolic pressure is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between beats. Blood pressure (BP) is recorded with the systolic number first, followed by the diastolic number. For example, a normal blood pressure would be recorded as something under 120/80 mm Hg.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

This can occur due to circulatory problems (i.e. anaemia, inadequate blood flow to some body parts), inability of the cells to utilize oxygen (i.e. poisoning) or insufficient oxygen pressure (i.e. exposure to high altitudes). Hypoxia can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, confusion, dizziness, headache, tingling, muscular impairment and visual disturbances. HYPERVENTILATION Hyperventilation is breathing at an abnormally rapid rate, leading to an abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood & changing the body’s acid-base balance. Hyperventilation can be caused due to stress or panic, motion sickness, high temperatures or hypoxia. The symptoms of hyperventilation include nausea, dizziness, tingling, muscular spasms, visual disturbances and feelings of suffocation. GASTROENTERITIS Gastroenteritis occurs due to food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. It is a common cause of illness for pilots. Symptoms appear suddenly and can lead to incapacitation during flight. The symptoms include nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and dehydration. DISENTERY Disentery is an infection transmitted through contaminated food or water. Amoebic dysentery is caused by a parasite called entamoeba histolytica. The symptoms include abdominal pain accompanied by diarrhoea with blood and mucus. In case of severe infection, it can affect the liver and the lungs. Typically, dizziness in not one of the main symptoms of disentery. PHYSICAL EXERTION Physical exertion refers to physical activities or exercise. During normal physical activities, the individual does not suffer from dizziness.",

            "explanation": "“1. regular drinking alone” Correct. There is nothing wrong with the occasional drink by oneself, problems may arise when this becomes a regular habit. Drinking alone is frequently mentioned as one of the common signs of alcoholism. When you start to drink alone on a more frequent basis, solitary drinking can quickly turn into an alcohol dependency or addiction “2. gulping the first drink” Correct. One of the common signs of alcohol use disorder include gulping drinks down in order to feel good. “3. improved memory” Incorrect. Alcohol abuse and addiction can negatively affect a person’s memory. The more a person abuses alcohol, the more likely he or she is to experience memory loss and other cognitive issues. “4. morning shakes” Correct. Alcohol is a depressant, slowing down part of the brain and interfering with mood-regulating chemicals. This means that heavy drinking gets the brain used to a reduced level of stimulation. As alcohol leaves the body of a heavy drinker, the brain is flooded with more activity, the nervous system becomes hyperactive, and you may experience alcohol tremors or shakes. The shakes can happen as quickly as eight hours after your last drink. “5. faster reaction times” Incorrect. Studies have shown that increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is also associated with a decreased reaction time. A blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% is generally associated with a clear loss of reaction time and control. “6. anger if one's drinking habits are criticized” Correct. Signs of a possible drinking problem include having friends or relatives express concern, being annoyed when people criticize your drinking, feeling guilty about your drinking and thinking that you should cut down but finding yourself unable to do so, or needing a morning drink to steady your nerves or relieve a hangover.",

Thus going quickly from outside on a sunny day into a darkened room has the effect of vision being severely reduced until dark adaptation takes place. Dark Adaptation. On the other hand, if a person remains in darkness for a long time the reverse takes place and both the cones and rods gradually become super-sensitive to light so that even the minutest amount of light causes excitement of the receptors. It takes about 7 minutes for the cones and 30 minutes for the rods for our eyes to adapt to darkness.",

During significant hypoxic stress, alcohol is accompanied by greater levels of oxygen desaturation. Even a small amount of oxygen will result in increased physiological altitude. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide. To cope with this extra demand, your breathing has to increase. Thus reducing physical activity reduces the oxygen needs and, consequently, reduces the susceptibility to hypoxia.

The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. The severity of otic barotrauma depends upon the rate of climb or descent. It occurs mainly at lower levels where pressure changes are the greatest. Normally, crew members may equalize pressure during descent by swallowing or yawing or by tensing the muscles of the throat. If such methods do not work, the Valsalva manoeuvre may be performed (pinch the nostrils, close the mouth, and breath out hard).",

Landing will also be hard in this case, because he/she will possibly flare late and touchdown with a large vertical speed. Furthermore, when approaching a runway with an upslope, the pilot views it at an increased angle, causing him to assume that he/she is higher above the runway than he/she actually is. He/she might then increase his/her rate of descent and land short of the runway. As a result, the combination of a narrower runway with an upslope can easily make the pilot believe that he/she is actually high on approach.

Since the amount of oxygen passing through a contact lens is directly related to the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding air (the cornea does not have its own blood supply), the amount of oxygen available under a contact lens will also diminish at higher altitudes. In addition, low cabin humidities may dehydrate soft lenses, inducing a further decrease in oxygen available beneath these lenses by as much as 15 percent.

RADIATION We are all exposed to radiation (Galactic and Solar radiation) which can, it is believed, increase the risk of cancers and may affect fertility. Galactic Radiation. This type of radiation originates from outside the solar system and produces steady and reasonably predicable low intensity flux of high energy particles. The earth's magnetic field deflects most of these particles and, additionally, stratospheric absorption gives considerable protection in equatorial regions but this effect declines to zero as the polar regions are approached. The effects of Galactic radiation increase with altitude. Solar Radiation / Solar Flares. This type of radiation is emitted by The Sun, and is variable based on \"solar flares\", which are also called solar storms, and are random, creating more solar radiation. It is quite similar to Galactic radiation in where it is highest, how it is absorbed, etc. One of the two other types of radiation mentioned are man-made sources, which consist of thinks like Nuclear power, weaponry, household items (Granite countertops, strangely) and more. Of course these are going to be low effect at high altitude, so that is why we think EASA are not including them in the correct answer. The other is \"naturally occurring elements\", which are exactly as they sound, elements such as uranium or plutonium, just to name 2, that exist naturally in the ground. Of course, the effect of these is going to be very low at high altitudes too, hence the reason they are not in the correct answer. Galactic radiation and solar flares are mostly absorbed by the Earth's magnetic field and the upper atmosphere, but at high latitudes and at high altitudes, they can be present in high amounts that affect flight crew quite significantly over the course of a career.",

            "explanation": "Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. As we have established above, vision is very much dependent on the supply of oxygen. Thus any condition which impairs the supply of oxygen will have an impact on vision: Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. Vitamin A has been shown to be useful in helping with night vision Vitamin A is a precursor of rhodopsin, the photopigment found in rods within the retina of our eye that helps us to see at night. Therefore a diet which lacks vitamin A will diminish night vision. Furthermore, bright lights destroy the rhodopsin, you should avoid being blinded by bright lights to keep a good night vision.",

Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll (radial/angular acceleration). The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

However, if nitrogen comes out of solution in the form of small bubbles, it can lead to severe issues. This can be likened to the formation of bubbles in carbonated beverages when the bottle is opened and pressure decreases. If nitrogen bubbles form in the blood within the human body, it directly leads to a condition called Decompression Sickness (DCS). Exposure of the body to reduced pressure can result in DCS. When there is a sudden decrease in ambient pressure, some of the nitrogen comes, out of solution as bubbles. Ascending to cabin altitudes above 18,000 feet is commonly associated with DCS. In severe cases, individuals may experience collapse, and DCS may persist even after descending, potentially leading to death. Factors such as hypoxia, cold temperatures, age, and excess body mass/obesity increase the risk of DCS. DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS The bends: The main symptoms of DCS include joint pain known as \"the bends,\" primarily affecting the shoulders, wrists, knees, and ankles. The affected joints may worsen with movement or rubbing, but descending to lower altitudes usually resolves the issue. The creeps: The release of nitrogen bubbles under the skin causes a sensation known as \"the creeps,\" where the sufferer feels as though a compact colony of ants is crawling over or just beneath the skin. The chokes: In the respiratory system, DCS can lead to \"the chokes\" as nitrogen bubbles may block pulmonary blood flow by getting trapped in the lungs' capillaries. This results in severe shortness of breath accompanied by a burning, gnawing, and sometimes piercing pain. The staggers: The bubbles also impact the blood supply to the brain and the nervous system, leading to \"the staggers.\" This causes a loss of certain mental functions and impaired control of movement. In extreme cases, chronic paralysis or permanent mental disturbances may occur.",

HEARING LOSS Hearing loss can be broadly separated into two categories: conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss results when there is any problem in delivering sound energy from the sound waves in the ear canal to your cochlea, the hearing part in the inner ear. The natural movement of sound through the external ear or middle ear becomes blocked or dampened in some way, and the full sound does not reach the cochlea. Common reasons for conductive hearing loss are blockages in the outer ear (earwax or other), damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane), damage to (or displacement of) the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), and any other damage or foreign objects that reduce or distort the sound that passes through to the cochlea. The most common causes of conductive deafness are blockages, which can be removed (or will be removed over time with infections), and are therefore temporary. Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss where sound waves are perfectly transmitted to the cochlea, but due to some pathological condition in the cochlea or succeeding parts of the auditory pathway (e.g. damaged hair cells), they are not converted to an adequate signal that can reach the cortex. These could be noise induced hearing loss, presbycusis, etc.",

There is a small pit called the fovea where almost all the light sensing cells are cones. This is the area where most “looking” occurs (the center of the visual field where detail, color sensitivity, and resolution are highest). While the cones and their associated nerves are well suited to detecting fine detail and color in high light levels, the rods are better able to detect movement and provide vision in dim light. The rods are unable to discern color but are very sensitive at low light levels. The trouble with rods is that a large amount of light overwhelms them, and they take a long time to “reset” and adapt to the dark again. There are so many cones in the fovea that the very center of the visual field hardly has virtually no rods at all. So in low light, the middle of the visual field is not very sensitive, but farther from the fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide the major portion of night vision.",

Both are refractive errors, or abnormalities of the eye that affect its ability to focus light on the retina. The medical term for short-sightedness is myopia. This occurs when light entering the eye does not focus properly on the retina, the membrane that lines the back of the eyeball. The eyeball is longer than normal and the image forms in front of the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry. Close-up vision, on the other hand, is not affected. Long-sightedness is somewhat the opposite of short sightedness. It usually is caused by an eyeball that's too short, which causes light to come to a focus behind the retina instead of directly on it.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Nonetheless, the recent feedback indicated its presence in HPL, likely due to it's loose relation to visual processing and sight. The feedback was not too clear on the exact wording though, so please let us know if you see this in the exam, and whatever wording you can remember from the real question, thank you! Let's go through each option. \"Ground features that are located on nearby slopes within a valley will pass the aircraft quickly, and could be missed.\" This is correct. Flying down valleys at low level means that you are much closer to the ground (and particularly the slopes on either side) than most pilots will be accustomed to from standard flying. This feels a lot faster, due to the local terrain going past the aircraft at a visually faster rate. This is an illusion of course, as we are just closer to the terrain, we are not actually travelling any faster. Nonetheless, it leaves a lot less time for visual navigation features to be identified, so they could be missed. \"It is very hard to spot visual features on sloping ground.\" Not really; it obviously depends on the ground and the feature, but it is not inherently more difficult to spot features on sloping ground than flat ground. \"There are usually no suitable visual features for navigation in mountainous regions.\" Certainly not. Mountainous regions are often rich with features for visual navigation, both natural and man-made. The shape of the mountains themselves are often very useful for navigating around. \"Around midday, the direct sunlight will make seeing ground features very difficult.\" Incorrect, the direct sunlight should make things easier to see usually around midday. In the early morning or afternoon, the mountains may obscure The Sun from shining on some of the slopes, and this could be difficult for navigation, but not at midday.",

Many different factors can cause this state of oxygen deficiency. Hypoxia is actually divided into four types: hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, stagnant hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia. HYPEMIC HYPOXIA This type of hypoxia is caused by the reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen. To the pilot, this means that, even though there is an adequate supply of oxygen to breathe, the blood's capacity to carry the oxygen to the cells has been impaired. There are a variety of reasons for this to happen. For instance, anemia, hemorrhage, hemoglobin abnormalities, and carbon monoxide interfere with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen the blood can carry to the cells. The most common cause for hypemic hypoxia in aviation is when carbon monoxide is inhaled because of aircraft heater malfunctions, engine manifold leaks, or cockpit contamination with exhaust from other aircraft. Hemoglobin bonds with carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it bonds with oxygen.",

Symptoms can include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting. Some of the causes of gastroenteritis include viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxins, parasites, particular chemicals and some drugs. Gastroenteritis is the commonest cause of pilot incapacitation whilst on duty. A study of over 5000 airline pilots discovered that 29% had at least one episode of incapacitation due to uncontrolled bowel actions. Gastroenteritis is, therefore, a threat to flight safety. \"Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways of preventing infection\" Correct. Hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infections. You can spread certain \"germs\" (a general term for pathogens like viruses and bacteria) casually by touching another person. You can also catch germs when you touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then you touch your face (mouth, eyes, and nose). \"3. Liquid intake should be reduced when suffering from gastroenteritis.\" Incorrect. The body is likely to lose a lot of water from diarrhoea. Therefore, when suffering from gastroenteritis, it is important to drink sufficient amount of water.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time which can be classified as acoustic trauma. Cabin noise settles at around 80 to 85 dB during cruise, which is sufficient to cause NIHL. Note: Noise is not a direct cause to conductive hearing loss.",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

During flight, you can experience disorientation if your brain receives conflicting messages from your senses. Proprioceptors sense is the term used to describe an awareness of position obtained from the nerves in your skin, joints, and muscles. This sense is unreliable, however, because the brain cannot tell the difference between input caused by gravity and that of manoeuvring G-loads. In good weather and daylight, you obtain your orientation primarily through your vision. In IFR conditions or at night, there are fewer visual cues, and your body relies upon the vestibular and proprioceptors to supplement your vision. Because these senses can provide false cues about your orientation, the probability of disorientation occurring in IFR weather is quite high. You are more subject to disorientation if you use body signals to interpret flight attitude. To alleviate symptoms of disorientation, you must properly interpret and rely on the indications of the flight instruments.",

THE OUTER EAR The outer ear includes the portion of ear that we see: the pinna/auricle and the auditory canal. The pinna or auricle is a concave cartilaginous structure which collects and directs sound waves travelling in air into the auditory canal. The sound waves will cause the ear drum to vibrate. THE MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is composed of the ear drum which serves as a divider between the outer ear and the middle ear structures. Connected to the ear drum is a linkage of three small bones, the ossicles (the malleus, incus and stapes) which transmit the vibrations across the middle ear, (filled with air) to the inner ear which is filled with liquid. Attached to the oval window of the inner ear, where a diaphragm sets in motion the fluid of the cochlea of the inner ear, the last of the bones – stapes – are found. The eustachian tube acts as an air pressure equalizer and ventilates the middle ear. Normally the tube is closed but opens while chewing or swallowing. When the eustachian tube opens, the air pressure between the outer and middle ear is equalized. The transmission of sound through the eardrum is optimal when the air pressure is equalized between the outer and middle ear THE INNER EAR The inner ear is composed of the sensory organ for hearing—the cochlea, as well as for balance—the vestibular system. The systems are separate, yet both are encased in the same bony capsule and share the same fluid systems. The diaphragm attached to the stapes causes the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate. Inside the cochlea there is a fine membrane covered with tiny hair-like cells. The movement of these small cells will be dependent on the volume and pitch of the original sound. The amount and frequency of displacement is detected by the auditory nerve which leads directly to the cortex of the brain where the tiny electrical currents are decoded into sound patterns.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time which can be classified as acoustic trauma. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

The end of the eustachian tube acts as a flap valve which allows air to escape with relative ease (required in the ascent) but can restrict air entering the middle ear (required in the descent). If the eustachian tube is blocked, air cannot reach the middle ear, so the pressure there decreases. When air pressure is lower in the middle ear than in the ear canal, the eardrum bulges inward. The pressure difference can cause pain and can bruise or rupture the eardrum. This is called Barotrauma. The problem is increased if the person has a cold or any other condition which has caused the mucous membrane lining the eustachian tube to become inflamed and swell. Someone with a cold will probably not be able to equalise the pressures and is at increased risk of Barotrauma. Pilots learn at an early stage of their flying training not to fly with a cold. Symptoms of Barotrauma include ear discomfort or pain, hearing deterioration and, potentially, hearing loss and feeling of pressure in the ears. In this question the problem is Barotrauma of the middle ear and it asks for the technique how to overcome it and the only way to do so is to allow for reduction of the pressure gradient via the tympanic membrane. The only provided option to achieve this is to stop descent and, if this is not sufficient, climb again to reduce outside air pressure.",

These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear, such as the membrane and sensitive hair cells in the cochlea, and cause Noise-induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds at or below 70 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 dB can cause hearing loss. NIHL can be caused by a one-time exposure to an intense “impulse” sound (above 120 dB), such as an explosion, or by continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time. The early symptoms are an inability to hear high pitched notes as these notes are normally detected by the finer cells which suffer the greatest damage. NIHL is an occupational hazard for those of us in the aviation industry. In order to prevent NIHL, one is strongly encouraged to wear earplugs or other protective devices when involved in a loud activity. If you can’t reduce the noise or protect yourself from it, move away from it.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen, resulting in a stable compound, carboxyhaemoglobin. Consequently, it prevents the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic and thus increasing the smoker’s physiological altitude and making him/her more susceptible to hypoxia. At sea level, the chronic smoker has a physiological altitude of about 5 000 to 8 000 ft (5 to 8% of carbon monoxide in the bood). As a result, for instance, a typical cabin altitude of 8 000 ft, will put he/she at an altitude of approximately 13 000 ft. Smoking at 10 000 ft MSL produces effects equivalent to those experienced at 13 000 ft MSL without smoking. This is called self-induced hypoxia. At altitude, the effects of a given level of carboxyhaemoglobin will be markedly increased by any hypoxia which exists as a result of the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air. The immediate treatment of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning consists of restoration of a safe breathing supply, preferably 100% oxygen if available, and rest at room temperature.",

The utricle and saccule organs within the vestibule are responsible for the perception of gravity and linear acceleration. A gelatinous substance within the utricle and saccule is coated with a layer of tiny grains of limestone called otoliths. Movement of the vestibule causes the otoliths to shift, which in turn causes hair cells to send out nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes, each at 90º angle to the other two. This allows them to sense yaw, pitch and roll. The canals are filled with fluid, and each has a gelatinous structure called cupula. When the body changes position, the canals move but the fluid lags behind, causing the cupula to lean away from the movement. Movement of the cupula results in deflection of hair cells that stimulate the vestibular nerve. This nerve transmits impulses to the brain, which interprets the signals as motion about an axis.",

Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

The hormone called insulin is responsible for breaking down glucose (sugar) and insulin is produced by the pancreas. Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin at all (Type 1) or when the insulin produced does not work properly (Type 2). There are two main types of Diabetes: Type I. This happens when there is no insulin to break down sugar. It typically occurs in younger persons. The risk of developing this type of diabetes is usually related to one’s genes and ethnicity, which are factors that cannot be controlled Type II. This happens when the insulin produced by the pancreas does not work properly. It typically occurs in persons over the age of 40. The risk of developing this type of diabetes increases with a lack of regular exercise, weight gain and a poor diet amongst other factors such as genetics. Up to 80 per cent of cases of Type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by making simple changes in one’s lifestyle including adopting a healthy diet, undertaking regular exercise and controlling one’s weight.",

Onset rate: when an acceleration sets on gradually, the body is capable of partially compensate for its effect, by vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure. However, when acceleration sets on rapidly, the body mechanisms for compensation will not be as effective. Thus acceleration will have a greater effect.",

            "explanation": "CARBON MONOXIDE Smoking produces carbon monoxide which is inhaled. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gas. Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

The body’s circadian rhythms control the sleep-wake cycle. They play a role in sleep due to how the body and brain respond to darkness, which is when most humans feel tired and tend to sleep. As darkness sets in, the body’s biological clock instructs the cells to slow down. When the evening becomes dark, the hormone melatonin starts to rise and allows sleep to occur. Melatonin peaks around 2–4 A. M. and then reduces by morning, allowing wakefulness. There is also a direct relationship between our body temperature and sleep cycle. At the time of lowest body temperature, we find it hardest to stay awake. We will start to feel sleepy at a time when the temperature is falling and be at our most wide awake when the temperature is rising. Body temperature variations throughout the day follow a regular cycle. The highest temperature occurs around 1700 hours and the lowest at about 0500 hours, at which time we are least efficient and the desire for sleep is at its peak.",

However, these benefits are short term. When we drink alcohol it disrupts the balance of chemicals and processes in the brain. These effects wear off fast and the pleasant feelings fade. If you rely on alcohol to mask your anxiety problems, you may find you become reliant on it to relax, which may lead to alcohol addiction. A likely side-effect of this is that the more you drink the greater your tolerance for alcohol will be. Over time you may need to drink more alcohol to get the same feeling. In the long term this pattern of alcohol use may affect your mental health. When alcohol consumption gets out of control, you may find yourself on a dangerous path toward addiction. Alcoholism is described as a chronic continual drinking or periodic consumption of alcohol which is characterized by impaired control over drinking and frequent episodes of intoxication. Those who struggle with alcohol dependence lose the ability to make good choices and often find themselves facing a judge for a variety of reasons. From driving under the influence and stealing to get more alcohol to child neglect and domestic issues, the list can be a long and painful one. If you drink heavily for a long time, you might have problems when you stop or cut back how much alcohol you drink. This is called alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms happen because the brain and body are trying to return to a state of equilibrium, where they do not need alcohol to function. Unfortunately, the intensity and pain of these withdrawal symptoms can compel someone to start drinking again to escape the pain and soothe their emotional distress.",

            "explanation": "Spatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement of the airplane in space. The body uses three integrated systems working together to ascertain orientation and movement in space. • Vestibular system—organs found in the inner ear that sense position by the way we are balanced. • Somatosensory system—nerves in the skin, muscles, and joints, which, along with hearing, sense position based on gravity, feeling, and sound. • Visual system—eyes, which sense position based on what is seen. All this information comes together in the brain and, most of the time, the three streams of information agree, giving a clear idea of where and how the body is moving. Flying can sometimes cause these systems to supply conflicting information to the brain, which can lead to disorientation. During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), the eyes are the major orientation source and usually prevail over false sensations from other sensory systems. When these visual cues are removed, as they are in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), false sensations can cause a pilot to quickly become disoriented. Approaching over still water at night - with few external cues (other than runway lights) may lead to glidepath overestimation.",

Continue the approach and hope for the best (Incorrect): Continuing the approach without clear guidance or situational awareness is unsafe. \"Hoping for the best\" is not a professional or reliable strategy in aviation. It can lead to misalignment with the runway, potential collision with obstacles, or an unsafe landing. Ask ATC for vectors and prepare in case of a missed approach (Correct): This is the correct course of action. ATC can provide accurate guidance (heading instructions) to ensure you are correctly aligned with the runway. Preparing for a missed approach ensures you are ready to take corrective action if necessary. Try to visually locate the runway without contacting ATC (Incorrect): While it might be possible to locate the runway visually, relying solely on visual navigation when you are already confused can be risky. Not contacting ATC means missing out on their guidance and support, which is crucial in ensuring a safe approach. This could lead to further confusion or errors in judgment. Perform an immediate go-around without informing ATC: Performing a go-around is a viable option if you are unsure of your position, but it must be done while informing ATC. Not informing ATC can create a safety hazard, as ATC needs to know your intentions to manage air traffic and prevent conflicts with other aircraft. Communication with ATC ensures that they can provide instructions for a safe go-around and re-approach.",

Without a sufficient quantity of CO2, normal respiration is disturbed, producing symptoms that resemble hypoxia. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. When the pilot realizes that he has just escaped a mid-air collision, he experiences symptoms of initial stress reaction: \"fight or flight\" response. The perception of threat activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body to fight or flee but may be experienced as uncomfortable when you do not know why they are happening. During the \"Fight or Flight\" response, your heart beats faster. A faster heart beat feeds more blood to the muscles and enhances your ability to run away or fight. Breathing becomes quicker and shallower. Quicker breathing takes in more oxygen to power the muscles. This makes the body more able to fight or run away.",

In addition hyperventilation can produce a pale, clammy appearance and muscle spasms, in contrast to the cyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. If you lose too much CO2 from your body, you might lose consciousness as the respiratory system’s overriding mechanism takes control of your breathing. After you become unconscious, your breathing rate will be exceedingly low until the CO2 level in your blood increases enough to stimulate normal respiration. Hyperventilation can be triggered by tension, fear or anxiety. Slowing your breathing rate, talking loud or breathing into a paper bag normally restores the body’s proper carbon dioxide level.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 040.02.03.03.01: State the role of the Eustachian tube in equalising pressure between the middle ear and the environment. Ear pain during descent is most often caused by the difference in air pressure between the cabin and a person's middle ear. The middle ear is a closed off environment, which is sealed off by the eustachian tube. As the aircraft climbs and descends (but the worst direction is descent, due to the way the eustachian tube opens outwards), the ear has more or less pressure inside than the ambient air, which feels like a dull pain within the ear, and sound becomes a little muffled. The eustachian tube can be opened by making large movements with the jaw, or by the action of swallowing. This will then equalise the middle ear pressure with that of the ambient air, removing the pain. This often occurs naturally when talking or eating, but is easy to induce manually. Another way of equalising pressure is the Valsalva manoeuvre (pinching the nose and blowing out through it), but this can be a bit harsher. People suffering from a cold or ear infection may struggle to equalise their ears at all due to a blocked eustachian tube, so may feel some discomfort for a while. Usually, this should clear over a few minutes/hours, but in extreme cases, could cause damage the eardrum due to the difference in pressure. This is very rare indeed, and unlikely to occur, especially when pain only begins on the approach. The problem is also that the aircraft has to land anyway, so cannot stop the descent, and it is not bad enough in this scenario to require a mayday call and emergency ambulance, so this is all the cabin crew can do to help.

Inhaled carbon monoxide passes easily into the bloodstream where it enters the red blood cells and binds to the haemoglobin, thus preventing the carriage of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, so that the tissues become hypoxic. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more strongly than oxygen and, the resulting compound, carboxyhaemoglobin, is more stable than the equivalent compound with oxygen. In numerical terms, carbon monoxide’s affinity for haemoglobin is over 200 times as great as that of oxygen. This means that even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. The first symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache (or tightness across the forehead) nausea and dizziness. It is an important fact that the effects of carbon monoxide are cumulative and even a very low concentration of carbon monoxide in the inspired air will result in a progressive build-up of carboxyhaemoglobin to harmful levels. A breath of fresh air will not bring early relief and several days may be required to completely rid the body of carbon monoxide.",

In early sleep we pass through about 10 minutes of Stage 1 before moving to the deeper Stage 2. Stage 2. In early sleep we spend about 20 minutes in stage 2 before moving on to the deeper Stage 3 and 4. About 50% of a normal spent is spent in Stage 2. Stage 3 and 4. During Stage 3 and 4 sleep the brain is semi-active emitting long slow waves, it is commonly referred to as “Slow Wave” or Orthodox sleep. The eyes are still behind the eyelids and the muscles are relaxed. Slow wave sleep refreshes the body and is necessary for tissue restoration. After strenuous physical activity, the body will require more slow wave sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Superimposed on the above 4 stages is REM (or Paradoxical sleep). In this phase the brain is active. Rapid eye movement behind the eyelids are detected and muscles twitch. It is complex, bizarre and emotionally colored dreams take place. REM sleep refreshes the brain. It strengthens and organizes the memory. After a period of learning new tasks or procedures REM sleep will increase.",

The in-flight environment may also increase the severity of symptoms which may only be minor whilst on the ground. Therefore, one issue with medication and performing aviation safety related duties is the underlying condition and, in addition, the symptoms may be compounded by the side effects of the medication prescribed or bought over the counter for treatment. The pilot is responsible to make sure that self medication has no adverse effect on a his/her ability to perform his/her duties safely. Before taking any medication and acting as a pilot or cabin crew member, the following three basic questions should be satisfactorily answered: (1) Do I feel fit to fly? (2) Do I really need to take medication at all? (3) Have I given this particular medication a personal trial on the ground to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on my ability to fly? \"2. Conditions in flight may alter the body’s reaction to medication.\" CORRECT. The lower partial pressure of oxygen, along with the low humidity in an aircraft cabin (increase in water loss), have effects on the body metabolism. Therefore, medication may, for instance, be metabolised slower and accumulate in the blood, causing more severe side effects than on the ground. \"Flying under medication is prohibited by law.\" INCORRECT. Flying under medication, such as sedatives or antidepressants, may be completely prohibited by law but this is not a general rules and there are many medicines which can be taken by flight crew.",

            "explanation": "\"1. Hyperventilation\" CORRECT. Simply, hyperventilation is overbreathing. One of the symptoms of hyperventilation are visual disturbances - blurred, tunnelling and clouding vision. \"2. Hypoxia\" CORRECT. Hypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough oxygen.” Vision is the first of the senses to be affected by a lack of oxygen. This is especially true of night vision. Even at a relatively low altitude of approximately 5 000 feet, where no other effect of hypoxia can be detected, night vision is appreciable reduced. Color vision starts to deteriorate between 1 500 - 3 000 m (5 000 – 10 000 ft). Therefore, at night, because vision is particularly sensitive to diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental oxygen when flying above 6 000 feet MSL. For smokers, this altitude may be even lower. \"3. Hypertension\" If prolonged and severe enough, hypertension can cause visual disturbances. Compared to visual disturbances caused by hypoxia, fatigue or hyperventilation, the ones caused by hypertension are more of a long term character. It is possible that EASA meant visual disturbances of short term character, but we really don't know. If you encounter this question on your exam, we would advise you to contest it. \"4. Fatigue\" CORRECT. To be able to keep tracking a moving object, the eyes need to act in harmony with one another which means coordinated control of the muscles of the two eyes by the brain. In a fatigued person, this coordination sometimes fails and the result is that quite differing images are transmitted from each eye. Subsequently double vision occurs.",

            "explanation": "Note that this questions asks for the most common causes of gastrointestinal upset (and not symptoms). Diarrhoea and vomiting are symptoms of gastrointestinal upset. Bacterial gastroenteritis happens when bacteria cause an infection in your gut. The infection leads to inflammation in your stomach and intestines. While viruses cause many gastrointestinal infections, bacterial infections are also common. Some people call these infections food poisoning. Moreover, flying to a number of different countries may cause the pilot to eat food that he/she is not used to. For example, in some countries, it is common to consume very spicy food. For those who are not used to, the consumption of spicy foods can trigger upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as indigestion. Drinking alcohol is associated with acid rising up from your stomach into your throat (known as acid reflux), or causing heartburn. Some evidence suggests alcoholic drinks can make your stomach produce more acid than usual, which can gradually wear away your stomach lining and make it inflamed and painful (gastritis).

Non-verbal communication includes facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, gestures displayed through body language (kinesics) and the physical distance between the communicators (proxemics). These non-verbal signals can give clues and additional information and meaning over and above spoken (verbal) communication. Indeed, some estimates suggest that around 70 to 80% of communication is non-verbal!",
