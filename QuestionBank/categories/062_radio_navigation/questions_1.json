The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like reflection from afar, and they may refer to it as such. Ground waves and sky waves both exist below the frequencies of VHF (30 MHz). Some strong ionospheric attenuation effects can affect the lower end of the VHF band, but in general, VHF, UHF and upwards all rely on space waves to communicate, and hence are reliant on line-of-sight.",

            "explanation": "The Sky Waves are the radiowaves of frequency between 2 MHz to 30 MHz. In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

Refraction is when waves, whether physical or electromagnetic, are deflected going through a substance. The wave generally changes the angle of its general direction. Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Interference is the phenomenon where waves meet each other and combine additively or substractively to form composite waves. In a sense there are similarities between interference and diffraction in the fact that both phenomena from a given wave produce other waves (with in general different frequency or phase and/or amplitude etc.). The main difference is the mechanism, diffraction involves a wave and some obstacle or object which deflects the wave or bends it and intereference involves a wave which combine with other waves.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed at the end, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) so FM (Frequency Modulation) is usually more clear, but has its own disadvantages.",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it can only be figure 1 or 6 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for an ILS mode, where the frequency of the ILS is indicated at the bottom of the display. Figure 1 indicates ‘VOR’ and figure 6 indicates ‘ILS’ with its associated frequency on the right of the ND. Therefore, the correct ND is represented in figure 6.",

            "explanation": "Radio waves propagate as surface waves, sky waves or space waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. Surface wave propagation can be achieved in VLF, LF, MF and HF radio waves. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Space wave propagation is achieved at VHF frequencies and above. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Surface waves ⇒ VLF, LF, MF and HF Sky waves ⇒ HF Space waves ⇒ VHF and above",

If the turn is unbalanced, an aircraft either slips into, or skids out of the turn, thereby reducing the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds",

These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Many RADARs are so-called \"Pulse RADARs\", as they operate by transmitting a very short pulse of a particular frequency, then they wait for a much longer time to receive a potential reflection off an object in that direction. Any such reflections are called returns, and the time between the pulse and the return can be used to calculate the distance to the object, as these pulses travel at the speed of light. This means that the pulse returns carry time data, which is information that the RADAR can use. These RADARs usually scan from side to side, and do this process hundreds or thousands of times per second, which allows obect locations to be plotted on a display. This is a modern usage of pulse modulation.",

It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. VORs use this principle in Doppler VORs (DVORs) which are the modern versions of VOR beacons. The variphase signal of the VOR is transmitted by a ring of antennas in a circle, and the signal transfers to each consecutive antenna, so the transmission point of the signal effectively moves round in a circle. This allows an aircraft to receive a frequency modulated signal due to the Doppler effect, to compare phase difference with the amplitude modulated reference signal, and calculate the aircraft's radial. GNSS (including GPS) systems use the Doppler effect to measure an object's speed, as the pseudo-random noise (PRN) signals are on an exact frequency, and the receiver knows the velocities of each satellite, so is able to work out the relative movement of the receiver with very small Doppler changes in frequency. MTI (Moving Target Indication) is less common to hear about, but this system allows a RADAR to know which objects are moving towards or away from the station due to the Doppler effect of their reflected pulses. It can be used to only show moving targets and remove radar clutter. Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) use the Doppler effect to judge the relative movements of moisture particles (raindrops, hail, etc.) based on the frequency of the reflected returns. If this movement is large and erratic, the RADAR system can then show it as an area of turbulence, which is useful information for the pilot. DMEs use a system of time measurement to measure distance from a ground station, and the \"groundspeed\" function uses the rate of change of that distance, not the Doppler effect. ILSs use difference in depth of modulation as a method of working out how far off localiser/glideslope the aircraft is, not the Doppler effect. AWRs have a mapping mode, but this does not use any Doppler measurements, as the ground is supposed to stay still.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 375 kHz, which is 375 x103 Hz or 0.375 MHz. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 375x103 = 800 m",

Some of them are absorbed, some are refracted and some manage to escape to the next layer. At this higher layer usually the radio waves bent down to earth again.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.02.03.01: Name the common different types of directional antennas: loop antenna used in old automatic direction-finding (ADF) receivers; parabolic antenna used in weather radars; slotted planar array used in more modern weather radars. Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption. Note: The reduction in side lobes is the main improvement referred to in the question, but there is also an option which mentions the reduced beam width. Whilst the beam width is thinner for a modern flat plate antenna, the use of the word \"considerably\" does make that option more specific, and less likely to be correct. This is backed up with feedback showing that the \"reduced side lobe\" answer is considered correct by EASA.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 118.7 MHz, which is 118.7 x106 Hz or 118 700 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 118.7x106 = 2.53 m",

            "explanation": "HF propagation over long distances during day and night is by skywave propagation originated by the reflection and refraction of radio waves between Earth's surface and the ionosphere. HF Radio waves can be reflected by the ionosphere and the earth's surface and propagate long distance from the transmitter to the receiver with several hops. Path loss of sky wave propagation varies with different conditions of ionosphere and types of the earth's surfaces. The ionosphere is a consequence of radiation from the sun ionizing Earth's atmosphere, so it changes significantly with time of day and sunspot activity. The F layer is mostly responsible for the refraction of radio waves back to Earth, preventing them from escaping to space. The other layers interact in other ways. During the day, the D layer forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers. The D layer is present during the day and is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses ( for MF and LF power loss is so high that sky-wave propagation is not possible for them). Hf frequency can propagate like ground wave as well but their range is very small: as the wavefront of the ground wave travels along the Earth's surface it is attenuated. The degree of attenuation is dependent upon a variety of factors. Frequency of the radio signal is one of the major determining factor as losses rise with increasing frequency. As a result, it makes this form of propagation impracticable above the bottom end of the HF portion of the spectrum (3 MHz). Typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB more than one at 0.5 MHz dependent upon a variety of factors in the signal path including the distance. In view of this it can be seen why even high power HF radio broadcast stations may only be audible for a few miles from the transmitting site via the ground wave",

            "explanation": "Amplitude modulation is a process by which the wave signal is transmitted by modulating the amplitude of the signal. It is often called as AM and is commonly used in transmitting a piece of information through a radio carrier wave. Amplitude modulation is mostly used in the form of electronic communication. Currently, this technique is used in many areas of communication such as in portable two-way radios, citizens band radio, VHF aircraft radio and in modems for computers. Amplitude modulation is also used to mention the mediumwave AM radio broadcasting. In general, amplitude modulation definition is given as a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in some proportion with respect to the modulating data or the signal. As for the mechanism, when amplitude modulation is used there is a variation in the amplitude of the carrier. Here, the voltage or the power level of the information signal changes the amplitude of the carrier. In AM, the carrier does not vary in amplitude. However, the modulating data is in the form of signal components consisting of frequencies either higher or lower than that of the carrier. The signal components are known as sidebands and the sideband power is responsible for the variations in the overall amplitude of the signal. (refer to annex1) The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. (refer to annex 2) Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

In wireless systems, fading may either be due to multipath propagation, referred to as multipath-induced fading, weather (rain), or shadowing from obstacles affecting the wave propagation, sometimes referred to as shadow fading. Medium frequency is mainly used for for AM broadcasting. During daytime, only local stations can be received. Propagation in the night allows strong signals within a range of about 2000 km. Naturally, because of the long distance travel affecting the wave propagation, fading occurs most likely in the lower frequency bands.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.02: State that radio waves in LF, MF and HF propagate as surface/ground waves and sky waves. This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both ground waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth - also called surface waves) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere). This can actually cause some interference when the two meet, especially at night when the ionosphere is thinner.",

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) produce a classification system for each type of radio wave, describing in 3 characters how a radio wave is modulated. Modulation is the act of putting information onto a radio wave, and includes pulse modulation, frequency modulation or amplitude modulation. The first letter is how the wave is modulated, the second character is what type of information is modulated onto the wave (digital, analogue, etc.) and the third is the information output (morse code, voice, etc.). The 3 character abbreviation for an old style NDB ident is A1A (These have keyed morse code modulation, BFO mode must be used to here the ident.), and a newer NDB ident is A2A (which has amplitude modulated morse code, so you can listen to it in any mode). The NDB carrier wave is N0N; it is not modulated and carries no information.

The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal (or sinusoidal signal) is known as the \"data signal\" or the \"message signal\". A carrier wave is a pure wave of constant frequency, a bit like a sine wave. By itself it doesn’t carry much information that we can relate to (such as speech or data). To include speech information or data information, another wave needs to be imposed, called an input signal, on top of the carrier wave. This process of imposing an input signal onto a carrier wave is called modulation. In other words, modulation changes the shape of a carrier wave to somehow encode the speech or data information that we were interested in carrying. Modulation is like hiding a code inside the carrier wave. Recall that any wave has three basic properties: Amplitude – the height of the wave Frequency – a number of waves passing through in a given second Phase – where the phase is at any given moment.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.03.01: Define ‘space waves’: the electromagnetic waves travelling through the air directly from the transmitter to the receiver. As the aircraft in this scenario is communicating with the ground station via VHF radio, the radio signals will only propagate as space waves. Space waves are line-of-sight waves that go in straight lines only, and therefore cannot go around obstacles, including around the Earth's horizon. This means that there is a very well defined limit of how far VHF communications can be received from. It is calculated with the formula: Range (nm) = 1.23 x √(height of transmitter(ft)) + 1.23 x √(height of receiver(ft)) As soon as the aircraft is outside of this range, VHF communication will not be possible. Relays with other aircraft closer to land could be used, but the aircraft will usually change to HF radio and datalink communications instead. HF radio can travel as a sky wave, which requires ionospheric refraction to \"bounce\" the signal off the upper atmosphere, and as a short surface/ground wave (although this is not really used), so can allow transmissions that can go further than the line-of-sight limitations of VHF. VHF has a frequency too high to be affected much by ionospheric attenuation and refraction, and therefore will not be able to form a sky wave. Its frequency is also too high to propagate for any reasonable distances as a ground wave, as the attenuation due to obstacles, etc. is huge. Even HF radio struggles to propagate as ground waves for our uses, so VHF is ever worse. There is some diffraction of VHF radio waves around the Earth's surface, which extends range slightly, but it is not a huge effect. Note: The mention of dawn in the question is not necessary, VHF radio is not affected by ionospheric refraction which could create a sky wave, so dawn/dusk/night does not make a difference.",

Tropospheric refraction occurs because the refractive index of the atmosphere decreases as altitude increases, leading to a bending of waves back toward the earth. Conversely, ionospheric refraction occurs because of the electrical properties of plasmas that are formed in the ionosphere as a result of ionization of the atmosphere. Reflection off the ionosphere is also possible if the frequency is low enough. We will differentiate these two effects, and refer to the former as atmospheric refraction and the latter as ionospheric propagation. The atmosphere will also attenuate radio signals, due to absorption by air molecules, water molecules, and precipitation (rain) The most important thing to note is that refractivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to pressure and humidity. Hence, as we go higher into the atmosphere, the refractivity tends to drop somce the pressure is less, and the air is more dry. Temperature plays a role as well, and in reality temperature gradients can cause the refractivity profile to be non-monotonic.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed in the receiver, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) and it also produces two \"side bands\" of information, one wave at the top, on at the bottom, of which one can be removed to save on power and bandwidth, as is done with HF communications in aviation.",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption.",

            "explanation": "HF radio waves propagate as both surface waves and sky waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. IONISATION AND SKIP DISTANCE At a fixed frequency, if ionisation decreases, the critical angle increases. This causes an increase in skip distance. Ionosphere exists due to Sun radiation. During dusk and night, Sun radiation is less and ionisation decreases, causing skip distance to become larger. This means that, for a constant frequency, the first sky wave reflects further away during the night than during the day. The aircraft is following an East Track (090°) and the Sun has set. This means that dusk is experienced and the decrease in ionisation causes the sky waves to propagate with a larger skip distance. If the aircraft was receiving surface waves, the sunset would not affect their perception. Consequently, the aircraft was receiving sky waves and the ionospheric changes have affected their path. The aircraft has entered the skip zone between the skywave and the surface wave (dead space).",

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial. The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readingsi. This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

As mentioned in the above learning objective, \"phase\" is a way to measure the position within a wave cycle. For instance, the first quarter of a wave cycle (from equilibrium up to the first peak, for example) is a phase of 1/4, but as we measure phases in terms of angles, it is 90º (1/4 of 360º). This means that a whole wave cycle makes up 360º of phase, which would represent a full circle, which is correct as circles are closely linked to waves. Phase can either dictate a position within a wave, or a \"distance\" within a wave, for instance a peak and a trough are 180º different in phase. It can also, in the same way, compare the timings of two waves (of the same frequency), called phase difference. Phase difference can tell us that two similar waves are at different points during their wave cycles, so if two waves were 180º out of phase, one would be at a peak and the other would be at a trough at the same time. In this question though, we are talking about \"phase\" only, not phase difference, so it is the first of these, the position within a wave cycle, expressed as an angle from 0-360º",

The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation.

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it cannot be figure 1 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a MAP mode, where NO ILS or VOR frequency is indicated at the bottom. Figure 4 indicates ‘VOR’, and on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom. Figure 3, however, has no VOR/ILS indication and at the deviation scale corresponds only to the deviation from the current FMS flight plan route. Figure 3 ND is displayed in MAP mode.",

An antenna operates by converting electric power into radio waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation. When an alternating current (AC) flows through the antenna, it generates an oscillating electric field. This electric field, in turn, creates a corresponding magnetic field, resulting in the formation of electromagnetic waves. In other words, an electromagnetic wave is simply a constantly changing electric field and a constantly changing magnetic field travelling outwards from a source. Electric fields and magnetic fields are integrally linked, and happen perpendicular to each other. Take a simple dipole antenna as an example. When a current is applied in one direction, it causes electrons to flow towards one side of the antenna, generating an electromagnetic field that surrounds the antenna. If we then reverse the current direction, the electromagnetic field also reverses, creating a ripple effect that propagates outward from the antenna. This ripple is the initial formation of a radio wave. To generate a continuous radio wave, we repeatedly switch the direction of the current in the antenna. This continuous back-and-forth switching of the current creates a series of ripples that propagate through space at the speed of light. Within the antenna, the electrons move back and forth at a frequency determined by us, which corresponds to the frequency of the radio waves produced. This back-and-forth movement of current is known as alternating current (AC).",

            "explanation": "Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct). Higher frequencies receive less ionospheric attenuation, therefore refracting less, and not bending as sharply in the ionosphere. This means that higher frequency radio signals do not \"bounce\" off the ionosphere at steep angles, thus making the skip distance longer. See the second annex above. The height of the ionosphere also makes a difference, a higher ionosphere means that the signals will travel further before reaching the level where refraction begins, and will travel further on the way back down also. This means that a higher ionosphere contributes to a longer skip distance.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. Two sidebands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one sideband to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means to accept HF radio, our receiver has to be of the single-sideband (SSB) type. This question is a bit too ambiguous, as it does not mention that we are picking up a HF VOLMET broadcast in simple terms. Instead it hints at the HF part as it is a long-haul flight currently en route, and that it is a VOLMET as they are trying to pick up \"meteorological information\". The learning objective above is very clear on this though, and once that LO is known, it is obvious what the question writer is getting at.",

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) produce a classification system for each type of radio wave, describing in 3 characters how a radio wave is modulated. Modulation is the act of putting information onto a radio wave, and includes pulse modulation, frequency modulation or amplitude modulation. The first letter is how the wave is modulated, the second character is what type of information is modulated onto the wave (digital, analogue, etc.) and the third is the information output (morse code, voice, etc.).

The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is the capability of the high directivity of the radio waves. Parabolic antennas are mainly used for point-to-point communications which uses the so called ‘high-gain antennas’. They work as either transmitters, receivers, or both. As transmitters, they produce a signal from the central point, backwards into the reflector dish. The parabolic shape directs all those signals in one direction (the direction the dish is pointing). As receivers, they do the exact opposite, taking in signals into the dish from a certain angle, then reflecting those all onto the central point (located at the focal point of the parabola.",

Further feedback is therefore requested, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Long distance voice communications (outside the line-of-sight) in aviation are achieved by using HF radio. HF (High Frequency) radio waves travel as space waves, but are also low enough frequency to be suitably refracted in the ionosphere, and can return as sky waves. They do also travel as ground (surface) waves, but they do not have a long range in this propagation method, so are not usually used like this. In other words, they can do all 3 propagation types, but we use them as sky waves. In particular, we use HF radio via sky waves for long distance communication, but with this method comes some limitations and complexity. The biggest limitation is the fact that sky waves have both a maximum range and a minimum range. The minimum range is that of the \"first skip\". As sky waves effectively \"bounce\" off the ionosphere, but cannot bounce at too steep of an angle (think of skimming stones), there is a minimum distance at which each frequency first arrives back at ground level. (For those who are interested, it is closer for low frequencies, and further away for high frequencies). This is called the skip distance, and there is a large distance between the end of the ground waves and the start of the sky waves that we call \"dead space\" or the \"skip zone\", where no signal is received. This \"first skip\" distance increases massively at night, when ionisation from the Sun is removed, and the ionosphere becomes a lot less \"bouncy\" to our signals. Now to our scenario. Not only are we flying towards the ATC transmitter/receiver (and therefore getting closer to the \"dead space area\"), but the night effect is beginning and our region of dead space is getting further and further away from the ground station. This means that it is incredibly likely that \"10 minutes later\", we are now inside that first skip distance (but still way further away that space or ground waves), and are therefore in \"dead space\", sometimes called the \"skip zone\". For those who might like to see it: a quick explanation of each option: \"The aircraft is now inside the skip zone, between the ground wave and the sky wave, and therefore cannot receive the controller.\" As described above, not only is the \"first skip\" distance increasing, but also we are flying towards it, so it is incredibly likely that we are now inside the \"skip zone\", so this is correct. \"The sky wave and ground wave are fading each other out as they arrive out of phase.\" This can happen intermittently, but only when both the sky and ground waves are being received, which cannot happen in HF radio, due to the short range of the ground wave and long \"first skip\" of the sky wave. \"The ground wave has been reduced by the night effect and the aircraft is no longer within its range.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback; we do not really use the ground wave of HF radio (range is too short), and it is not really affected by the night effect. \"The aircraft's communication systems have all failed. It must immediately declare emergency and divert to the nearest suitable alternate.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback. This is unlikely to have happened (when you understand HF radio you know there is a much better explanation), and the rest is made purposefully ridiculous.",

            "explanation": "The Sky Waves are the radiowaves of frequency between 2 MHz to 30 MHz. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

Light is called unpolarized if the direction of this electric field fluctuates randomly in time. Many common light sources such as sunlight, halogen lighting, LED spotlights, and incandescent bulbs produce unpolarized light. If the direction of the electric field of light is well defined, it is called polarized light. The most common source of polarized light is a laser. Depending on how the electric field is oriented, we classify polarized light into three types of polarizations: Linear polarization: the electric field of light is confined to a single plane along the direction of propagation Circular polarization: the electric field of light consists of two linear components that are perpendicular to each other, equal in amplitude, but have a phase difference of π/2. The resulting electric field rotates in a circle around the direction of propagation and, depending on the rotation direction, is called left- or right-hand circularly polarized light. Elliptical polarization: the electric field of light describes an ellipse. This results from the combination of two linear components with differing amplitudes and/or a phase difference that is not π/2. This is the most general description of polarized light, and circular and linear polarized light can be viewed as special cases of elliptically polarized light.",

            "explanation": "As the name implies, Phase Modulation, PM uses variations in phase for carrying the modulation. Phase modulation works by modulating the phase of the signal, i.e. changing the rate at which the point moves around the circle. This changes the phase of the signal from what it would have been if no modulation was applied. In other words the speed of rotation around the circle is modulated about the mean value. To achieve this it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal for a short time. In other words when phase modulation is applied to a signal there are frequency changes and vice versa. Phase and frequency are inseparably linked as phase is the integral of frequency. Note: For the ranging codes and navigation messages to travel from the satellite to the receiver, they must be modulated onto a carrier frequency, by varying the phase of the signal ( phase modulation). As soon as a data signal will be modulated onto the carrier wave, the phase of the carrier wave is reversed by 180°. The receiver will detect this reversal and is able to reconstruct the data.",

These waves propagation can be classified depending upon the frequencies as: Ground waves propagation Skywave propagation Free space propagation Ground wave propagation is a type of radio propagation which is also known as a surface wave. These waves propagate over the earth’s surface in low and medium frequencies. These are mainly used for transmission between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere. These are made up of the number of constituent waves. The reason why it is known as a ground wave is that it is the sum of the waves that are reflected by the earth’s surface or any hills. The waves follow the curvature of the earth enabling them to cover beyond the horizon. Beyond the horizon, the waves get blocked by the curvature of the earth and the signals are produced by the diffracted surface wave. Advantages of Ground Wave Propagation These waves have the tendency to bend around the corners or obstructions during propagation which makes them more efficient and also these are not affected by the change in atmospheric conditions. Disadvantages of Ground Wave Propagation High-frequency waves cannot be transmitted as the energy losses are more because of the absorption of energy in the earth’s atmosphere. These are used to cover short ranges and also involves attenuation of waves as they interact with the eddy currents produced by the surface of the earth.",

The Doppler effect is where waves have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart (see the above annex, it occurs for EM waves and sound waves). It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. The Doppler effect occurs everywhere from astronomy (Redshift) to the sound of an ambulance passing us in the street. In aviation, we make use of the effect in modern Doppler VORs, GNSS systems and radars, for MTI (moving target indication) and turbulence detection. The best way to answer these questions is by thinking of a loud car (an ambulance with sirens on, a car honking its horn, etc.) going past you. The frequency (pitch) of the sound starts high, but decreases as the vehicle passes, and stays low whilst the vehicle is moving away. Therefore the frequency is increased when moving together, and reduced when moving apart.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.02: State that radio waves in LF, MF and HF propagate as surface/ground waves and sky waves. This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both surface waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere).",

Surface wave propagation exists at frequencies from about 20 kHz to about 50 MHz (from the upper end of VLF to the lower end of VHF). Surface waves are created due to diffraction. The portion of the wave in contact with the surface of the earth is retarded, which results in bending of the wave around the surface of the earth. The range of the surface waves is limited due to surface attenuation (the wave induces a voltage in the Earth, which takes energy away from it). Sky wave propagation exists at frequencies between 2 MHz to 30 MHz (from the upper end of MF to the whole HF range). Sky waves are radio waves that reach the ionosphere (an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere) and are reflected back toward the Earth. Since sky waves are not limited by the curvature of the Earth, sky wave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. For every frequency capable to create sky waves, there is an angle between the vertical and the radio wave known as critical angle ( above which total internal refraction occurs and the wave returns to the surface (first returning sky wave). At angles below critical, radio waves pass straight through ionosphere and outer space (they do not return on the surface of the earth). The distance from the transmitter to the point where the first returning sky wave appears at the surface is known as the skip distance. From the point where the surface wave is totally attenuated to the point where the first returning sky wave appears there will be no detectable signal. This area is known as dead space.",

There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 121.95 MHz, which is 121.95 x106 Hz or 121 950 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only.

Please send us any further feedback if you do see this question, as we would certainly like to see if they change the options, or if they accept the appeal. We believe this question has already been appealed at least once, so hopefully it will soon be gone completely. NDBs (Non-Directional Beacons) emit their signals in the MF and LF frequency bands, which allows them to propagate as sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere) and surface waves (sticking to the ground). Surface waves stick to the surface of the Earth, in a strange fight between reflection, diffraction, and refraction with the charged surface of the Earth. They can propagate very far in the right conditions, and mostly maintain their direction over the Earth, other than when going from land to sea, where they shift direction as part of the \"coastal effect\". We can go through each option now to try and work out which could be most correct: \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the sky wave.\" This would give us a better chance of receiving a sky wave, as the angles would be shallower, so more chance of the waves \"bouncing\" off the ionosphere due to total internal refraction. However, the bouncing off the ionosphere introduces large changes of lateral direction, and we would not receive an accurate bearing, but we would receive a stronger bearing. We would argue that this is useless, as we use NDBs for navigation, so wildly inaccurate bearings are just as bad as no bearing at all. \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the ground wave.\" Ground waves run along the surface of the Earth, and hold their direction much better than sky waves, so this is how we usually pick up long range NDB bearings, however we do not believe that climbing higher will aid us to do this. \"Increase your distance from the NDB to better capture the ground wave.\" Ground waves have limited distance, the closer you are to the source, the better the reception, therefore this is wrong. \"Fly towards the NDB to better capture the sky wave.\" before the \"first skip\" distance of the sky wave, no sky wave will be present, and remember, we do not want to get a sky wave anyway, as it often has fading or is in the wrong direction, giving us a bad bearing. As you can see, there is no good answer here, and we believe that the assumption that you have to make to answer it is misleading.",

Nevertheless, a student recently reported encountering it in their RNAV exam. If you come across this question in your RNAV exam, it is advisable to report it. A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation. APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a PLAN mode. This mode is easily identifiable thanks to the True North orientation symbol at the bottom of the ND and the fact that you cannot see weather radar indications on this mode. Only Figure 2 displays the MAP mode.",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct).",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Airborne weather radar is typically Xband, pulse modulated and operating in the 8-12 Ghz range with a wavelenght approx. 3 cm (remember well: 3 GHz -300GHz correspond ro a wavelenght of 10cm-1mm). The shape of the radar beam is very important in the design of a radar. For purposes of airborne weather radar, a narrow beam is the most desirable because it concentrates more energy on the target, which means more energy will come back in the echo. Flat Plate antennas are better than dish antennas and larger antennas are better than smaller antennas for concentrating the beam. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a radar will determine its maximum range. The PRF must be long enough to allow the echo pulses to return from the maximum range target. The longer the required range, the lower the PRF Scanning speed comes into play with the PRF since a high scanning speed and low PRF would cause targets to be missed. At least one pulse should be transmitted per a beam width of scan. Pulse width will determine the minimum range of the radar and also the resolution size of the target. If a target is close and the echo is reflected back to the radar while the transmitter pulse is still being transmitted, then obviously that target will be missed. Most radars I have worked with had a pulse width of less than 4 microseconds so this isn’t a problem. Also, many radars will shorten their pulse width in map mode allowing a higher degree of resolution for ground targets such as shorelines or islands.",

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcast. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Refer to annex 1 Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. (annex2) Refer to annex 2 Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. A problem can occur called the night effect, which is most prominent during sunrise and sunset, where the changing sunlight modifies the ionisation of the ionosphere, and causes the sky waves to \"bounce off\" the ionosphere at sharper angles, greatly increasing the skip distance. This means that some radio waves that can travel as both ground waves and sky waves (such as the MF frequencies used in NDBs) can begin to interfere with each other. This interference is called \"fading\", and is because the two signals may; be out of phase from each other, have different polarities, or be arriving from different directions (particularly problematic for NDBs).",

            "explanation": "VHF (VERY HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION VHF communication channels is the standard means of voice communication in aviation. The VHF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 117.975 and 137 MHz. VHF communication is transmitted in the form of direct (space) waves. VHF radio waves propagation requires line-of-sight. This means that if there is mountainous terrain or obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, transmission will be interrupted. VHF propagation range is also limited by the height of the transmitter and the receiver, and the transmission power of the aircraft and the ground station. The theoretical maximum range of VHF propagation is given by the formula Range = 1.25(√HT + √HR), where HT is the height of the transmitter in feet, HR is the height of the receiver in feet and Range is in nautical miles. HF (HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION The HF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 2850 and 22 000 KHz. Voice communications via the HF frequency channels are used in areas where voice communication via the VHF channels becomes impractical. This happens when flying on North Atlantic Tracks (NAT) or across vast water bodies. HF radio frequencies enable communication over longer distances. HF transmitters use higher power outputs than VHF transmitters, increasing the range of their transmission. HF radio waves are propagated as sky waves, rising into the upper atmosphere and encountering ionosphere (an ionized layer of the atmosphere due to radiation from the Sun). Within the ionosphere, these waves refract sufficiently to return to Earth. This propagation path allows for an increase in the range of transmission of the HF radio waves when compared with the direct waves of VHF propagation path. Long distances over water do not allow for the presence of VHF ground transmitters, which means that the aircraft might be outside the maximum theoritical range of VHF communication. This is why HF is used instead.",

The most extreme case of \"slant range error\" occurs when the aircraft passes directly over the station; instead of reading zero, the DME shows the altitude of the airplane above the station (in nautical miles). Slant range error also affects groundspeed and time-to-station displays when you're close to the station. Displayed DME groundspeed drops below actual groundspeed as you approach the station and then climbs back to normal after you pass it. Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station. The DME range (slant range) can be calculated using the following formula: Slant Range = 1.23 (√H1 + √H2 ) H1 = altitude of the aircraft (ft) H2 = elevation of the DME station (ft) In our case: FL210 ft correspond at 21000ft Slant Range = 1.23 (√21000 + √0 ) Slant Range = 1.23 x 144.9 Slant Range = 178.2 NM With the aircraft at a distance of 220 NM we can say that at FL 210 it is beyond the maximum theoretical range or below the line of sight minimum altitude for this distance.",

The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like reflection from afar, and they may refer to it as such. Ground waves and sky waves both exist below the frequencies of VHF (30 MHz). Some strong ionospheric attenuation effects can affect the lower end of the VHF band, but in general, VHF, UHF and upwards all rely on space waves to communicate, and hence are reliant on line-of-sight.",

In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication. Thus the range of communication can be increased by increasing the heights of transmitting and receiving antennas. The space wave propagation is utilized in television communication, radar communication etc.",

The CPDLC is a FANS application that consists of transmitting datalink formatted messages between the pilot (the aircraft) and the ATC controller or the Company (the ground). A message sent by the aircraft to the ground is called a downlink message, the opposite is called an uplink message. Datalink messages may concern various requests such as route modifications, speed changes, voice contact requests (ex: transfer of ATC center), emergency messages (MAYDAY), crossing constraints, pre-departure clearances, ATIS, oceanic clearances, etc. Datalink messages can be sent using different media such as HF datalink, VHF datalink, or SATCOM. The SATCOM has the fastest rate of transmission, while the HF datalink has the slowest. The SATCOM is particularly good as there is no line-of-sight limitation and no variable quality of signals disturbed by ionospheric conditions, however, this media is not installed on all airplanes. The ground routing of the ATC datalink communications is performed by service providers (SITA, ARINC) that can be interconnected to provide continuity of the transmissions. The ACARS allows air/ground datalink communications for Airline Operational and Air Traffic Communications (AOC and ATC). It stands for Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System and is included in the aircraft Management Unit (or MU or CMU). ACARS messages are transmitted from the ground to the aircraft and vice-versa using several radio communication media such as VHF, HF, SATCOM. In the early days of the ACARS, it was using only VHF for transmission, but nowadays advanced technology allows the ACARS to chose itself the transmitting method depending on the current coverage and flown airspace.",

Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Interference is the phenomenon where waves meet each other and combine additively or substractively to form composite waves. In a sense there are similarities between interference and diffraction in the fact that both phenomena from a given wave produce other waves (with in general different frequency or phase and/or amplitude etc.).

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed at the end, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) so FM (Frequency Modulation) is usually more clear, but has its own disadvantages.",

            "explanation": "A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation. APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? Knowing this, it can only be figure 1 or 6 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for an ILS mode, where the frequency of the ILS is indicated at the bottom of the display. Figure 1 indicates ‘VOR’ and figure 6 indicates ‘ILS’ with its associated frequency on the right of the ND. Therefore, the correct ND is represented in figure 6.",

            "explanation": "Radio waves propagate as surface waves, sky waves or space waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. Surface wave propagation can be achieved in VLF, LF, MF and HF radio waves. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Sky wave propagation is possible in HF frequency band. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. Space wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves in a straight line. Space wave propagation requires line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Space wave propagation is achieved at VHF frequencies and above. The maximum theoretical range (in nm) of a space wave is 1.23 x √H1 + 1.23 x √H2 where H1 is the height in feet of the transmitter above mean sea level and H2 is the height in feet of the receiver above mean sea level. Surface waves ⇒ VLF, LF, MF and HF Sky waves ⇒ HF Space waves ⇒ VHF and above",

Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds",

Monopole antenna: This antenna has a more complicated design. A monopole antenna, as seen in figure 2, consists of a single conductor, usually attached to the ground. Because of the use of only one conductor, the monopole antenna has twice the gain of a similar dipole antenna. Loop antenna: Loop antenna, as the name suggests, suggest of a loop of wire. Loop antennas, as seen in figure 3, correspond directly with the magnetic field of the radio wave, which means they are insensitive to electrical noise. Quadrupole antenna: As the name suggests, this antenna consists of 4 parts. This is the most complex form of antenna and therefore not much used.

These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually, as shown above. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. These signals are carried along by the carrier wave, and then decoded in a receiver unit back to their original state, giving voice messages in the case of VHF. If a transmitter was faulty, it may not be able to encode the voice message information onto the carrier wave, and so may be able to send the carrier wave only, with no modulation. This would sound like clicks, or crackles down the radio, similar to what can be heard when a pilot presses the Push To Talk (PTT) button but says nothing. This carrier wave can be used to send signals in morse code if necessary, effectively going back to the days of pulse modulation.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Many RADARs are so-called \"Pulse RADARs\", as they operate by transmitting a very short pulse of a particular frequency, then they wait for a much longer time to receive a potential reflection off an object in that direction. Any such reflections are called returns, and the time between the pulse and the return can be used to calculate the distance to the object, as these pulses travel at the speed of light. This means that the pulse returns carry time data, which is information that the RADAR can use. These RADARs usually scan from side to side, and do this process hundreds or thousands of times per second, which allows obect locations to be plotted on a display. This is a modern usage of pulse modulation.",

It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. VORs use this principle in Doppler VORs (DVORs) which are the modern versions of VOR beacons. The variphase signal of the VOR is transmitted by a ring of antennas in a circle, and the signal transfers to each consecutive antenna, so the transmission point of the signal effectively moves round in a circle. This allows an aircraft to receive a frequency modulated signal due to the Doppler effect, to compare phase difference with the amplitude modulated reference signal, and calculate the aircraft's radial. GNSS (including GPS) systems use the Doppler effect to measure an object's speed, as the pseudo-random noise (PRN) signals are on an exact frequency, and the receiver knows the velocities of each satellite, so is able to work out the relative movement of the receiver with very small Doppler changes in frequency. MTI (Moving Target Indication) is less common to hear about, but this system allows a RADAR to know which objects are moving towards or away from the station due to the Doppler effect of their reflected pulses. It can be used to only show moving targets and remove radar clutter. Airborne Weather Radars (AWRs) use the Doppler effect to judge the relative movements of moisture particles (raindrops, hail, etc.) based on the frequency of the reflected returns. If this movement is large and erratic, the RADAR system can then show it as an area of turbulence, which is useful information for the pilot. DMEs use a system of time measurement to measure distance from a ground station, and the \"groundspeed\" function uses the rate of change of that distance, not the Doppler effect. ILSs use difference in depth of modulation as a method of working out how far off localiser/glideslope the aircraft is, not the Doppler effect. AWRs have a mapping mode, but this does not use any Doppler measurements, as the ground is supposed to stay still.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 375 kHz, which is 375 x103 Hz or 0.375 MHz. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 375x103 = 800 m",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.02.03.01: Name the common different types of directional antennas: loop antenna used in old automatic direction-finding (ADF) receivers; parabolic antenna used in weather radars; slotted planar array used in more modern weather radars. Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption. Note: The reduction in side lobes is the main improvement referred to in the question, but there is also an option which mentions the reduced beam width. Whilst the beam width is thinner for a modern flat plate antenna, the use of the word \"considerably\" does make that option more specific, and less likely to be correct. This is backed up with feedback showing that the \"reduced side lobe\" answer is considered correct by EASA.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 118.7 MHz, which is 118.7 x106 Hz or 118 700 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 118.7x106 = 2.53 m",

            "explanation": "HF propagation over long distances during day and night is by skywave propagation originated by the reflection and refraction of radio waves between Earth's surface and the ionosphere. HF Radio waves can be reflected by the ionosphere and the earth's surface and propagate long distance from the transmitter to the receiver with several hops. Path loss of sky wave propagation varies with different conditions of ionosphere and types of the earth's surfaces. The ionosphere is a consequence of radiation from the sun ionizing Earth's atmosphere, so it changes significantly with time of day and sunspot activity. The F layer is mostly responsible for the refraction of radio waves back to Earth, preventing them from escaping to space. The other layers interact in other ways. During the day, the D layer forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers. The D layer is present during the day and is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses ( for MF and LF power loss is so high that sky-wave propagation is not possible for them). Hf frequency can propagate like ground wave as well but their range is very small: as the wavefront of the ground wave travels along the Earth's surface it is attenuated. The degree of attenuation is dependent upon a variety of factors. Frequency of the radio signal is one of the major determining factor as losses rise with increasing frequency. As a result, it makes this form of propagation impracticable above the bottom end of the HF portion of the spectrum (3 MHz). Typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB more than one at 0.5 MHz dependent upon a variety of factors in the signal path including the distance. In view of this it can be seen why even high power HF radio broadcast stations may only be audible for a few miles from the transmitting site via the ground wave",

            "explanation": "Amplitude modulation is a process by which the wave signal is transmitted by modulating the amplitude of the signal. It is often called as AM and is commonly used in transmitting a piece of information through a radio carrier wave. Amplitude modulation is mostly used in the form of electronic communication. Currently, this technique is used in many areas of communication such as in portable two-way radios, citizens band radio, VHF aircraft radio and in modems for computers. Amplitude modulation is also used to mention the mediumwave AM radio broadcasting. In general, amplitude modulation definition is given as a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in some proportion with respect to the modulating data or the signal. As for the mechanism, when amplitude modulation is used there is a variation in the amplitude of the carrier. Here, the voltage or the power level of the information signal changes the amplitude of the carrier. In AM, the carrier does not vary in amplitude. However, the modulating data is in the form of signal components consisting of frequencies either higher or lower than that of the carrier. The signal components are known as sidebands and the sideband power is responsible for the variations in the overall amplitude of the signal. (refer to annex1) The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. (refer to annex 2) Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both ground waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth - also called surface waves) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere). This can actually cause some interference when the two meet, especially at night when the ionosphere is thinner.",

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) produce a classification system for each type of radio wave, describing in 3 characters how a radio wave is modulated. Modulation is the act of putting information onto a radio wave, and includes pulse modulation, frequency modulation or amplitude modulation. The first letter is how the wave is modulated, the second character is what type of information is modulated onto the wave (digital, analogue, etc.) and the third is the information output (morse code, voice, etc.). The 3 character abbreviation for an old style NDB ident is A1A (These have keyed morse code modulation, BFO mode must be used to here the ident.), and a newer NDB ident is A2A (which has amplitude modulated morse code, so you can listen to it in any mode). The NDB carrier wave is N0N; it is not modulated and carries no information. The learning objectives also state that we must know the classification for VHF communication waves, which is A3E as per the above LO. This is the limit of the learning objectives on these classifications. You do not need to find and memorise the table.",

Mixing of low frequency signal with high frequency carrier signal is called modulation. The sinusoidal signal that is used in the modulation is known as the carrier signal, or simply \"the carrier\". The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal (or sinusoidal signal) is known as the \"data signal\" or the \"message signal\". A carrier wave is a pure wave of constant frequency, a bit like a sine wave. By itself it doesn’t carry much information that we can relate to (such as speech or data). To include speech information or data information, another wave needs to be imposed, called an input signal, on top of the carrier wave. This process of imposing an input signal onto a carrier wave is called modulation. In other words, modulation changes the shape of a carrier wave to somehow encode the speech or data information that we were interested in carrying. Modulation is like hiding a code inside the carrier wave. Recall that any wave has three basic properties: Amplitude – the height of the wave Frequency – a number of waves passing through in a given second Phase – where the phase is at any given moment.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.03.01: Define ‘space waves’: the electromagnetic waves travelling through the air directly from the transmitter to the receiver. As the aircraft in this scenario is communicating with the ground station via VHF radio, the radio signals will only propagate as space waves. Space waves are line-of-sight waves that go in straight lines only, and therefore cannot go around obstacles, including around the Earth's horizon. This means that there is a very well defined limit of how far VHF communications can be received from. It is calculated with the formula: Range (nm) = 1.23 x √(height of transmitter(ft)) + 1.23 x √(height of receiver(ft)) As soon as the aircraft is outside of this range, VHF communication will not be possible. Relays with other aircraft closer to land could be used, but the aircraft will usually change to HF radio and datalink communications instead. HF radio can travel as a sky wave, which requires ionospheric refraction to \"bounce\" the signal off the upper atmosphere, and as a short surface/ground wave (although this is not really used), so can allow transmissions that can go further than the line-of-sight limitations of VHF. VHF has a frequency too high to be affected much by ionospheric attenuation and refraction, and therefore will not be able to form a sky wave. Its frequency is also too high to propagate for any reasonable distances as a ground wave, as the attenuation due to obstacles, etc. is huge. Even HF radio struggles to propagate as ground waves for our uses, so VHF is ever worse. There is some diffraction of VHF radio waves around the Earth's surface, which extends range slightly, but it is not a huge effect. Note: The mention of dawn in the question is not necessary, VHF radio is not affected by ionospheric refraction which could create a sky wave, so dawn/dusk/night does not make a difference.",

Tropospheric refraction occurs because the refractive index of the atmosphere decreases as altitude increases, leading to a bending of waves back toward the earth. Conversely, ionospheric refraction occurs because of the electrical properties of plasmas that are formed in the ionosphere as a result of ionization of the atmosphere. Reflection off the ionosphere is also possible if the frequency is low enough. We will differentiate these two effects, and refer to the former as atmospheric refraction and the latter as ionospheric propagation. The atmosphere will also attenuate radio signals, due to absorption by air molecules, water molecules, and precipitation (rain) The most important thing to note is that refractivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to pressure and humidity. Hence, as we go higher into the atmosphere, the refractivity tends to drop somce the pressure is less, and the air is more dry. Temperature plays a role as well, and in reality temperature gradients can cause the refractivity profile to be non-monotonic.",

In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulses of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude Modulation (AM) is shown in the annex above, which is the easiest to get an understanding of how modulation works. We \"overlay\" an information wave on top of the carrier wave, so the information is carried without needing another transmission, and then the carrier wave is just removed in the receiver, but the information remains intact. AM is quite sensitive to noise (hisses and crackles) and it also produces two \"side bands\" of information, one wave at the top, on at the bottom, of which one can be removed to save on power and bandwidth, as is done with HF communications in aviation.",

Radars such as AWRs (Airborne Weather Radars) have to be able to send pulses of electromagnetic radiation in one direction all at once. This is more difficult than it sounds, due to the way that these waves are produced. Parabolic Antenna The older method of directing this energy was by using a parabolic reflector dish, which is a shape that reflects all radiation from the focal point in the middle outwards in the same direction, and vice versa, any radiation from that direction is reflected onto the focal point in the middle. This allows for a transmitter/receiver device to be placed in the focal point, facing backwards towards the dish, and for its transmissions to go forwards, ahead of the aircraft, and receive the reflected pulses indicating the presence of weather. One of the biggest problems with the parabolic antenna is the side lobes. The formation of this \"main beam\" of radiation does cause some unwanted extra radiation, called side lobes, which send some of the energy in a different direction than intended, and can cause some spurious and incorrect responses on the radar screen. Slotted Planar Array / Flat Plate Antenna / Phased Array These types of radars use a more efficient modern technique, by having a flat plate with numerous waveguide-size slots cut into it, it can produce a similar beam to the parabolic antenna with much smaller sidelobes. The lesser side lobes means that there are less spurious returns and that there is less wasted energy, meaning that less energy is needed for the same radar scan. The main beam (main lobe) of a slotted planar array can also be made thinner than the parabolic antenna beam, which would use even less energy, allowing for increased range, or just lower energy consumption.",

            "explanation": "HF radio waves propagate as both surface waves and sky waves. Surface wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves along the Earth's surface. Surface wave propagation involves waves that follow the curvature of the Earth due to a process known as diffraction. As these waves encounter the Earth's surface, they can bend around obstacles and continue propagating beyond the line of sight covering longer distances and reach areas that are obstructed from direct line-of-sight communication. During sky wave propagation, signals are transmitted upwards and then refracted back to Earth by the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon allows radio signals to travel beyond the horizon and across continents. Not all HF radio waves return as sky waves. There is a critical angle of transmission above which the waves are reflected back and not absorbed, which changes with frequency and ionisation levels. IONISATION AND SKIP DISTANCE At a fixed frequency, if ionisation decreases, the critical angle increases. This causes an increase in skip distance. Ionosphere exists due to Sun radiation. During dusk and night, Sun radiation is less and ionisation decreases, causing skip distance to become larger. This means that, for a constant frequency, the first sky wave reflects further away during the night than during the day. The aircraft is following an East Track (090°) and the Sun has set. This means that dusk is experienced and the decrease in ionisation causes the sky waves to propagate with a larger skip distance. If the aircraft was receiving surface waves, the sunset would not affect their perception. Consequently, the aircraft was receiving sky waves and the ionospheric changes have affected their path. The aircraft has entered the skip zone between the skywave and the surface wave (dead space).",

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial. The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readingsi. This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

As mentioned in the above learning objective, \"phase\" is a way to measure the position within a wave cycle. For instance, the first quarter of a wave cycle (from equilibrium up to the first peak, for example) is a phase of 1/4, but as we measure phases in terms of angles, it is 90º (1/4 of 360º). This means that a whole wave cycle makes up 360º of phase, which would represent a full circle, which is correct as circles are closely linked to waves. Phase can either dictate a position within a wave, or a \"distance\" within a wave, for instance a peak and a trough are 180º different in phase. It can also, in the same way, compare the timings of two waves (of the same frequency), called phase difference. Phase difference can tell us that two similar waves are at different points during their wave cycles, so if two waves were 180º out of phase, one would be at a peak and the other would be at a trough at the same time. In this question though, we are talking about \"phase\" only, not phase difference, so it is the first of these, the position within a wave cycle, expressed as an angle from 0-360º",

Knowing this, it cannot be figure 1 (full rose mode). Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode?

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.01.02.01.01: Define ‘antenna’: an antenna or aerial is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa. An antenna operates by converting electric power into radio waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation. When an alternating current (AC) flows through the antenna, it generates an oscillating electric field. This electric field, in turn, creates a corresponding magnetic field, resulting in the formation of electromagnetic waves. In other words, an electromagnetic wave is simply a constantly changing electric field and a constantly changing magnetic field travelling outwards from a source. Electric fields and magnetic fields are integrally linked, and happen perpendicular to each other. Take a simple dipole antenna as an example. When a current is applied in one direction, it causes electrons to flow towards one side of the antenna, generating an electromagnetic field that surrounds the antenna. If we then reverse the current direction, the electromagnetic field also reverses, creating a ripple effect that propagates outward from the antenna. This ripple is the initial formation of a radio wave. To generate a continuous radio wave, we repeatedly switch the direction of the current in the antenna. This continuous back-and-forth switching of the current creates a series of ripples that propagate through space at the speed of light. Within the antenna, the electrons move back and forth at a frequency determined by us, which corresponds to the frequency of the radio waves produced. This back-and-forth movement of current is known as alternating current (AC).",

            "explanation": "Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct). Higher frequencies receive less ionospheric attenuation, therefore refracting less, and not bending as sharply in the ionosphere. This means that higher frequency radio signals do not \"bounce\" off the ionosphere at steep angles, thus making the skip distance longer. See the second annex above. The height of the ionosphere also makes a difference, a higher ionosphere means that the signals will travel further before reaching the level where refraction begins, and will travel further on the way back down also. This means that a higher ionosphere contributes to a longer skip distance.",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one sideband, and the wave under the troughs is the other sideband. Two sidebands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one sideband to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means to accept HF radio, our receiver has to be of the single-sideband (SSB) type. This question is a bit too ambiguous, as it does not mention that we are picking up a HF VOLMET broadcast in simple terms. Instead it hints at the HF part as it is a long-haul flight currently en route, and that it is a VOLMET as they are trying to pick up \"meteorological information\". The learning objective above is very clear on this though, and once that LO is known, it is obvious what the question writer is getting at.",

A parabolic antenna is an antenna that consists out of a parabolic reflector to direct radio waves. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is the capability of the high directivity of the radio waves. Parabolic antennas are mainly used for point-to-point communications which uses the so called ‘high-gain antennas’. They work as either transmitters, receivers, or both. As transmitters, they produce a signal from the central point, backwards into the reflector dish. The parabolic shape directs all those signals in one direction (the direction the dish is pointing). As receivers, they do the exact opposite, taking in signals into the dish from a certain angle, then reflecting those all onto the central point (located at the focal point of the parabola.",

Further feedback is therefore requested, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Long distance voice communications (outside the line-of-sight) in aviation are achieved by using HF radio. HF (High Frequency) radio waves travel as space waves, but are also low enough frequency to be suitably refracted in the ionosphere, and can return as sky waves. They do also travel as ground (surface) waves, but they do not have a long range in this propagation method, so are not usually used like this. In other words, they can do all 3 propagation types, but we use them as sky waves. In particular, we use HF radio via sky waves for long distance communication, but with this method comes some limitations and complexity. The biggest limitation is the fact that sky waves have both a maximum range and a minimum range. The minimum range is that of the \"first skip\". As sky waves effectively \"bounce\" off the ionosphere, but cannot bounce at too steep of an angle (think of skimming stones), there is a minimum distance at which each frequency first arrives back at ground level. (For those who are interested, it is closer for low frequencies, and further away for high frequencies). This is called the skip distance, and there is a large distance between the end of the ground waves and the start of the sky waves that we call \"dead space\" or the \"skip zone\", where no signal is received. This \"first skip\" distance increases massively at night, when ionisation from the Sun is removed, and the ionosphere becomes a lot less \"bouncy\" to our signals. Now to our scenario. Not only are we flying towards the ATC transmitter/receiver (and therefore getting closer to the \"dead space area\"), but the night effect is beginning and our region of dead space is getting further and further away from the ground station. This means that it is incredibly likely that \"10 minutes later\", we are now inside that first skip distance (but still way further away that space or ground waves), and are therefore in \"dead space\", sometimes called the \"skip zone\". For those who might like to see it: a quick explanation of each option: \"The aircraft is now inside the skip zone, between the ground wave and the sky wave, and therefore cannot receive the controller.\" As described above, not only is the \"first skip\" distance increasing, but also we are flying towards it, so it is incredibly likely that we are now inside the \"skip zone\", so this is correct. \"The sky wave and ground wave are fading each other out as they arrive out of phase.\" This can happen intermittently, but only when both the sky and ground waves are being received, which cannot happen in HF radio, due to the short range of the ground wave and long \"first skip\" of the sky wave. \"The ground wave has been reduced by the night effect and the aircraft is no longer within its range.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback; we do not really use the ground wave of HF radio (range is too short), and it is not really affected by the night effect. \"The aircraft's communication systems have all failed. It must immediately declare emergency and divert to the nearest suitable alternate.\" Created by us to fill in the incomplete feedback. This is unlikely to have happened (when you understand HF radio you know there is a much better explanation), and the rest is made purposefully ridiculous.",

            "explanation": "The Sky Waves are the radiowaves of frequency between 2 MHz to 30 MHz. These radio waves can propagate through atmosphere and are reflected back by the ionosphere of earth’s atmosphere. Since these waves go from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna while traveling through sky, hence their propagation is known as sky wave propagation. Take a look at the annex, the path b represents the sky wave propagation. The sky waves are of practical importance at medium and high frequencies (i.e. at medium waves and short waves) for very long distance radio communication. The sky wave propagation is also known as ionosphere propagation, since the sky waves reach the receiver after reflection from the ionosphere. In a single reflection from the ionosphere, the radio waves cover a distance not more than 4000 km. With the help of sky wave propagation, a very long distance round the globe communication is possible. The Space Waves are the radio waves of very high frequency, between 30 MHz to 300 MHz or more (VHF). The space waves can travel through atmosphere from transmitter antenna to receiver antenna either directly or after reflection from ground in the earth’s troposphere region. That is why the space wave propagation is also called as tropospherical propagation. Let’s have a look at the annex once again, path c represents space wave propagation. The space wave propagation is utilized in very high frequency (VHF) bands (between 30 MHz to 300 MHz), ultra high frequency (UHF) bands and microwaves. This is because, at such high frequencies, the sky wave and ground wave propagations, both fail. The space wave propagation is also called as line of sight propagation. This propagation is limited (i) to the line of sight distance and (ii) by the curvature of the earth. The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other, which is also called range of communication.

Light is called unpolarized if the direction of this electric field fluctuates randomly in time. Many common light sources such as sunlight, halogen lighting, LED spotlights, and incandescent bulbs produce unpolarized light. If the direction of the electric field of light is well defined, it is called polarized light. The most common source of polarized light is a laser. Depending on how the electric field is oriented, we classify polarized light into three types of polarizations: Linear polarization: the electric field of light is confined to a single plane along the direction of propagation Circular polarization: the electric field of light consists of two linear components that are perpendicular to each other, equal in amplitude, but have a phase difference of π/2. The resulting electric field rotates in a circle around the direction of propagation and, depending on the rotation direction, is called left- or right-hand circularly polarized light. Elliptical polarization: the electric field of light describes an ellipse. This results from the combination of two linear components with differing amplitudes and/or a phase difference that is not π/2. This is the most general description of polarized light, and circular and linear polarized light can be viewed as special cases of elliptically polarized light.",

Phase modulation works by modulating the phase of the signal, i.e. changing the rate at which the point moves around the circle. This changes the phase of the signal from what it would have been if no modulation was applied. In other words the speed of rotation around the circle is modulated about the mean value. To achieve this it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal for a short time. In other words when phase modulation is applied to a signal there are frequency changes and vice versa. Phase and frequency are inseparably linked as phase is the integral of frequency. Note: For the ranging codes and navigation messages to travel from the satellite to the receiver, they must be modulated onto a carrier frequency, by varying the phase of the signal ( phase modulation). As soon as a data signal will be modulated onto the carrier wave, the phase of the carrier wave is reversed by 180°. The receiver will detect this reversal and is able to reconstruct the data.",

These waves propagation can be classified depending upon the frequencies as: Ground waves propagation Skywave propagation Free space propagation Ground wave propagation is a type of radio propagation which is also known as a surface wave. These waves propagate over the earth’s surface in low and medium frequencies. These are mainly used for transmission between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere. These are made up of the number of constituent waves. The reason why it is known as a ground wave is that it is the sum of the waves that are reflected by the earth’s surface or any hills. The waves follow the curvature of the earth enabling them to cover beyond the horizon. Beyond the horizon, the waves get blocked by the curvature of the earth and the signals are produced by the diffracted surface wave. Advantages of Ground Wave Propagation These waves have the tendency to bend around the corners or obstructions during propagation which makes them more efficient and also these are not affected by the change in atmospheric conditions. Disadvantages of Ground Wave Propagation High-frequency waves cannot be transmitted as the energy losses are more because of the absorption of energy in the earth’s atmosphere. These are used to cover short ranges and also involves attenuation of waves as they interact with the eddy currents produced by the surface of the earth.",

The Doppler effect is where waves have a slightly higher detected frequency when the transmitter and receiver are coming together, but a lower frequency when moving apart (see the above annex, it occurs for EM waves and sound waves). It is a measurable difference, as we often know the precise frequency that we should be picking up, and so small variations from that can tell us if a transmitter or a reflector is moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. The Doppler effect occurs everywhere from astronomy (Redshift) to the sound of an ambulance passing us in the street. In aviation, we make use of the effect in modern Doppler VORs, GNSS systems and radars, for MTI (moving target indication) and turbulence detection. The best way to answer these questions is by thinking of a loud car (an ambulance with sirens on, a car honking its horn, etc.) going past you. The frequency (pitch) of the sound starts high, but decreases as the vehicle passes, and stays low whilst the vehicle is moving away. Therefore the frequency is increased when moving together, and reduced when moving apart.",

Learning Objective 062.01.03.04.02: State that radio waves in LF, MF and HF propagate as surface/ground waves and sky waves. This question contains a mixture of two different learning objectives, one is to know which frequency range of radio waves use a single side band (HF), and the second is to know how HF waves propagate. When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that HF transmissions are single side band (SSB). Also to note, HF radio waves are between 3 - 30 MHz (the range just below familiar VHF), and they travel as both surface waves (clinging on to the surface of the earth) and sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere).",

Surface wave propagation exists at frequencies from about 20 kHz to about 50 MHz (from the upper end of VLF to the lower end of VHF). Surface waves are created due to diffraction. The portion of the wave in contact with the surface of the earth is retarded, which results in bending of the wave around the surface of the earth. The range of the surface waves is limited due to surface attenuation (the wave induces a voltage in the Earth, which takes energy away from it). Sky wave propagation exists at frequencies between 2 MHz to 30 MHz (from the upper end of MF to the whole HF range). Sky waves are radio waves that reach the ionosphere (an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere) and are reflected back toward the Earth. Since sky waves are not limited by the curvature of the Earth, sky wave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. For every frequency capable to create sky waves, there is an angle between the vertical and the radio wave known as critical angle ( above which total internal refraction occurs and the wave returns to the surface (first returning sky wave). At angles below critical, radio waves pass straight through ionosphere and outer space (they do not return on the surface of the earth). The distance from the transmitter to the point where the first returning sky wave appears at the surface is known as the skip distance. From the point where the surface wave is totally attenuated to the point where the first returning sky wave appears there will be no detectable signal. This area is known as dead space.",

They are transverse waves, meaning that the electric and magnetic fields involved travel from side to side (or up and down) whilst the wave goes \"forwards\". There are a few components of these waves that you are required to know. Two of the most important are wavelength and frequency. We have already mentioned that the wave travels at the speed of light, but that does not tell us how long the wave is. The wavelength is the distance from one part of a wave cycle to the same part of the next wave cycle. For instance, from one trough to the next, or from one peak to the next. We can use this information to tell us how many times a wave peak (or trough) will pass us every second, which is the frequency of the wave. This can also be described as the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) The relationship between these values is by the formula: c = f x λ c = the speed of light (m/s) f = frequency (Hz) λ (Lambda) = wavelength (m) The speed of light (c) is 300 000 000 m/s, so 3x108 m/s. The frequency is 121.95 MHz, which is 121.95 x106 Hz or 121 950 000 MHz in long form. Remember to use metric units, Metres, Hertz and Metres per Second only. We can rearrange the formula to be: λ = c / f and then plug in the information to give: λ = 3x108 / 121.95x106 = 2.46 m",

When we want to send information via radio waves, we have to modulate the carrier wave somehow, this is the process of adding information to it. There are a few ways to do this. In the early days of radio, it was done by sending pulse of the carrier wave as morse code, pulse modulation. These days we can modulate the amplitude of the carrier wave, to carry our information, or we can modulate the frequency slightly, to carry information also. Amplitude modulation is easier to do and far easier to represent visually. The peaks and troughs of our carrier wave are modified to create our information wave over the top of each peak, and the same information wave under each trough. The wave over the peaks is one side band, and the wave under the troughs is the other side band. Two side bands are created, but when we send HF radio signals, we remove one side band to reduce the required power of the transmitter, and the required bandwidth. This means that, for our uses, HF transmissions are single side band (SSB).",

We believe this question has already been appealed at least once, so hopefully it will soon be gone completely. NDBs (Non-Directional Beacons) emit their signals in the MF and LF frequency bands, which allows them to propagate as sky waves (bouncing off the ionosphere) and surface waves (sticking to the ground). Surface waves stick to the surface of the Earth, in a strange fight between reflection, diffraction, and refraction with the charged surface of the Earth. They can propagate very far in the right conditions, and mostly maintain their direction over the Earth, other than when going from land to sea, where they shift direction as part of the \"coastal effect\". We can go through each option now to try and work out which could be most correct: \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the sky wave.\" This would give us a better chance of receiving a sky wave, as the angles would be shallower, so more chance of the waves \"bouncing\" off the ionosphere due to total internal refraction. However, the bouncing off the ionosphere introduces large changes of lateral direction, and we would not receive an accurate bearing, but we would receive a stronger bearing. We would argue that this is useless, as we use NDBs for navigation, so wildly inaccurate bearings are just as bad as no bearing at all. \"Climb to increase your chance of capturing the ground wave.\" Ground waves run along the surface of the Earth, and hold their direction much better than sky waves, so this is how we usually pick up long range NDB bearings, however we do not believe that climbing higher will aid us to do this. \"Increase your distance from the NDB to better capture the ground wave.\" Ground waves have limited distance, the closer you are to the source, the better the reception, therefore this is wrong. \"Fly towards the NDB to better capture the sky wave.\" before the \"first skip\" distance of the sky wave, no sky wave will be present, and remember, we do not want to get a sky wave anyway, as it often has fading or is in the wrong direction, giving us a bad bearing. As you can see, there is no good answer here, and we believe that the assumption that you have to make to answer it is misleading.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This question has been excluded from the RNAV database and relocated to subject 022 (022.13.03.01.02). Nevertheless, a student recently reported encountering it in their RNAV exam. If you come across this question in your RNAV exam, it is advisable to report it. A navigation Display (ND) provides a mode selectable flight progress display. The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation. APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a PLAN mode. This mode is easily identifiable thanks to the True North orientation symbol at the bottom of the ND and the fact that you cannot see weather radar indications on this mode. Only Figure 2 displays the MAP mode.",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only, so you can only receive a signal if you are within Line-of-Sight (LOS). Another propagation path is via ground waves, these are used by NDBs in order to transmit their simple signals long distances following the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves (surface waves) follow the contours of the surface, making their ranges drastically reduced by mountainous terrain, and extended over seas. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. The \"skip distance\" is the distance away from the transmitter where the first sky wave returns to the surface after bouncing off the ionosphere. This can create a dead zone of reception for some frequencies which travel as both ground and sky waves, as, for example the ground waves might stop at 100 nm, but the sky waves only begin at 200 nm (these numbers are not even close to correct).",

Modern weather radars are mostly doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation. Airborne weather radar is typically Xband, pulse modulated and operating in the 8-12 Ghz range with a wavelenght approx. 3 cm (remember well: 3 GHz -300GHz correspond ro a wavelenght of 10cm-1mm). The shape of the radar beam is very important in the design of a radar. For purposes of airborne weather radar, a narrow beam is the most desirable because it concentrates more energy on the target, which means more energy will come back in the echo. Flat Plate antennas are better than dish antennas and larger antennas are better than smaller antennas for concentrating the beam. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a radar will determine its maximum range. The PRF must be long enough to allow the echo pulses to return from the maximum range target. The longer the required range, the lower the PRF Scanning speed comes into play with the PRF since a high scanning speed and low PRF would cause targets to be missed. At least one pulse should be transmitted per a beam width of scan. Pulse width will determine the minimum range of the radar and also the resolution size of the target. If a target is close and the echo is reflected back to the radar while the transmitter pulse is still being transmitted, then obviously that target will be missed. Most radars I have worked with had a pulse width of less than 4 microseconds so this isn’t a problem. Also, many radars will shorten their pulse width in map mode allowing a higher degree of resolution for ground targets such as shorelines or islands.",

The loop antenna is a system which rotates and measures when a current output (due to the incoming NDB signals) occurs. Due to the vertical polarisation of NDB signals and the antenna rotation, there are 2 null points in the system (points of zero current), where the antenna is completely perpendicular to the incoming signals, giving us 2 potential relative bearings. The sense aerial then tells us which of the two points the NDB signal is coming from, and then this direction is outputted to an ADF indicator in the cockpit.",

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcast. Why Do We Need Modulation? Practically speaking, modulation is required for; High range transmission Quality of transmission To avoid the overlapping of signals. Difference Between AM And FM Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are used to transmit data using the method of modifying a carrier signal. The AM technique is totally different from frequency modulation and phase modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in the first case and in the second one the phase is varied respectively. Refer to annex 1 Amplitude Modulation Amplitude modulation is a modulation technique where the amplitude of a carrier varies depending on the information signal. AM radio broadcast signals use lower carrier frequencies, this helps them to travel long distances. Sometimes AM signals can be able to bounce off the ionosphere. The distance travelled by the AM is much larger than the FM. (annex2) Refer to annex 2 Frequency Modulation In this module, the frequency of the carrier wave is modified according to the signal that carries information. The radio signals have large bandwidth than AM radio signals, which helps to offer much better sound quality. Frequency modulation also enables to transmit stereo signals. Summary Amplitude Modulation (AM) Frequency Modulation (FM) The radio wave is called a carrier wave and the frequency and phase remain the same The radio wave is called a carrier wave, but the amplitude and phase remain the same Has poor sound quality, but can transmit longer distance Has higher bandwidth with better sound quality The frequency range of AM radio varies from 535 to 1705 kHz The frequency range of FM is 88 to 108 MHz in the higher spectrum More susceptible to noise Less susceptible to noise",

Radio waves can propagate in many different ways. The most common is as a \"space wave\". This is what most people think of when it comes to radio transmission, as this is line of sight, meaning that the radio waves travel in straight lines only. Another propagation path is via ground waves, which \"cling\" to the surface and follow the contours of the Earth. The third method of propagation is via sky waves, which are space waves that interact with the charged particles in the ionosphere. When these waves reach the ionosphere, the subsequent ionospheric attenuation refracts the waves, changing their course, until the waves are heading downwards again. This is often referred to as \"reflection\" by EASA, so do not be confused; it is refraction that occurs, it just looks like the reflection from afar, and they use the terms almost interchangeably. A problem can occur called the night effect, which is most prominent during sunrise and sunset, where the changing sunlight modifies the ionisation of the ionosphere, and causes the sky waves to \"bounce off\" the ionosphere at sharper angles, greatly increasing the skip distance. This means that some radio waves that can travel as both ground waves and sky waves (such as the MF frequencies used in NDBs) can begin to interfere with each other. This interference is called \"fading\", and is because the two signals may; be out of phase from each other, have different polarities, or be arriving from different directions (particularly problematic for NDBs).",

            "explanation": "VHF (VERY HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION VHF communication channels is the standard means of voice communication in aviation. The VHF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 117.975 and 137 MHz. VHF communication is transmitted in the form of direct (space) waves. VHF radio waves propagation requires line-of-sight. This means that if there is mountainous terrain or obstacles between the transmitter and the receiver, transmission will be interrupted. VHF propagation range is also limited by the height of the transmitter and the receiver, and the transmission power of the aircraft and the ground station. The theoretical maximum range of VHF propagation is given by the formula Range = 1.25(√HT + √HR), where HT is the height of the transmitter in feet, HR is the height of the receiver in feet and Range is in nautical miles. HF (HIGH FREQUENCY) COMMUNICATION The HF communication frequencies used in aviation are between 2850 and 22 000 KHz. Voice communications via the HF frequency channels are used in areas where voice communication via the VHF channels becomes impractical. This happens when flying on North Atlantic Tracks (NAT) or across vast water bodies. HF radio frequencies enable communication over longer distances. HF transmitters use higher power outputs than VHF transmitters, increasing the range of their transmission. HF radio waves are propagated as sky waves, rising into the upper atmosphere and encountering ionosphere (an ionized layer of the atmosphere due to radiation from the Sun). Within the ionosphere, these waves refract sufficiently to return to Earth. This propagation path allows for an increase in the range of transmission of the HF radio waves when compared with the direct waves of VHF propagation path. Long distances over water do not allow for the presence of VHF ground transmitters, which means that the aircraft might be outside the maximum theoritical range of VHF communication. This is why HF is used instead.",

The most extreme case of \"slant range error\" occurs when the aircraft passes directly over the station; instead of reading zero, the DME shows the altitude of the airplane above the station (in nautical miles). Slant range error also affects groundspeed and time-to-station displays when you're close to the station. Displayed DME groundspeed drops below actual groundspeed as you approach the station and then climbs back to normal after you pass it. Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station. The DME range (slant range) can be calculated using the following formula: Slant Range = 1.23 (√H1 + √H2 ) H1 = altitude of the aircraft (ft) H2 = elevation of the DME station (ft) In our case: FL210 ft correspond at 21000ft Slant Range = 1.23 (√21000 + √0 ) Slant Range = 1.23 x 144.9 Slant Range = 178.2 NM With the aircraft at a distance of 220 NM we can say that at FL 210 it is beyond the maximum theoretical range or below the line of sight minimum altitude for this distance.",

The Earth’s surface over which the ground wave travels also has an impact on the range of an NDB. Multipath propagation phenomenon results in radio signals reaching the receiving antenna by two or more paths. This can result in a false indication of the ADF needle that points to the source of the reflection and not the NDB in use.

DVOR: Doppler VOR is an evolution of CVOR, providing improved signal quality and accuracy by reducing scalloping error. The reference signal of DVOR is amplitude-modulated and the variable signal is frequency-modulated, exactly the opposite of CVOR. TVOR: Terminal VORs, as the name suggests, are located in terminal areas of aerodromes. These are power-limited to 50 W with a range of 25 NM. They often form part of departure and arrival structures. Therefore, these are normally positioned along the runway centreline. VOT: The VOT, or sometimes abbreviated as VORT, is a test VOR facility sometimesprovided at aerodromesand is not used for navigation. Pilots on the ground can tune in to this facility and check the receiver accuracy of the aircraft.",

DMEs can also provide groundspeed and time-to-station readouts by differentiation. The DME will measure the distance in a straight line to the ground beacon (the slant range), not the distance from a point on the ground vertically below the aircraft (ground range). The difference is generally insignificant, except that when directly over a beacon when the distance shown will be height above the beacon. DME operates in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band and the 252 available channels are contained between 960 and 1215 MHz. It utilises a double pulse in both the interrogator and the transponder. All pulses are the same duration, that is, 3.5 micro-seconds. Discrimination between channels is accomplished by both frequency separation and pulse spacing. Channels are numbered from 1 to 126 and each channel number is further divided into two channels designated ‘X’ and ‘Y’. Each numbered pair of channels is separated from the adjoining pair by 1 MHz. The ‘X’ channels are separated from the ‘Y’ channels by varying the pulse separation time. The pulse separation spacing is the same for all ‘X’ channels, being 12 micro-seconds for both the interrogator and the transponder. In the case of ‘Y’ channels the pulse spacing is 36 micro-seconds for the interrogator and 30 micro-seconds for the transponder.",

The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white )",

The effect can be minimised by: Flying higher - a higher altitude minimises this coastal refraction effect. Using NDBs close to the coast - this reduces the effect of the error to the pilot, even though the waves bend just as much.

You can twist your paper to look in this direction for easiest understanding, you will want to be looking backwards down the 020 radial you drew earlier. As we have half scale \"fly right\" indication, which means 5º fly right to get onto the course, we can draw our aircraft as being 5º left of the selected inbound course, meaning that we are on radial 025. At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 210º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle on 025º, which is Figure D.

It aimed to address the limitations of ILS and offer enhanced flexibility to its users. MLS ILS Its range is signifigantly greater than ILS. The coverage area for the approach direction as being within a sector of +/- 40° of the centre line out to a range of 20-30 NM from the threshold (according to ICAO Annex 10) The standard coverage area of the LOC and GP with angular sector limits in degrees and distance limits from the transmitter: LOC coverage area is 10° on either side of the centre line to a distance of 25 NM from the runway, and 35° on either side of the centre line to a distance of 17 NM from the runway; GP coverage area is 8° on either side of the centre line to a distance of minimum 10 NM from the runway. It operates in the SHF band 5 031 – 5 090.7 MHz, vertically polarised. This allows it to be positioned in hilly terrain without requiring the site to be leveled. Issues such as course deviation errors (bending) of the localizer and glide path, caused by aircraft, vehicles, and structures, are mitigated as the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted, thereby avoiding reflections. The localiser operates in the VHF band between 108 and 111.975 MHz. This part of the frequency band is shared with VOR: the LOC frequencies are odd decimals (e.g., 108.1 108.15; 108.3 108.35; 108.5 108.55 -111.95 MHz). The glide path operates in the UHF band between 329.15 and 335 MHz. The glide path frequency is paired with the localiser and selection of the frequency is automatic. The LOC and GP transmissions are frequency paired in accordance with the list published at ICAO.

            "explanation": "The Difference in Depth Modulation (DDM) is a principle used by the ILS to define a position in an airspace. The deviation detection of the aircraft from the desired track is based on two different overlapping lobes. These lobes are radiated by both the localiser and the glide path antennas. These consist of a 90 Hz lobe and a 150 Hz lobe. The equipment of an aircraft approaching for landing measures the difference in DDM of the two lobes and deflectes the localizer needle accordingly. For the localiser, stronger signals from the 90 Hz lobe means a displacement to the left. Whereas stronger signals from the 150 Hz lobe means a right displacement in relation to the centreline. When both the signals received are at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the centreline and the localiser needle will indicate zero. The Difference in Depth of Modulation (DDM) will vary proportionally and linearly with the angular displacement of the aircraft from the extended runway centerlinel. Assume that you are on the centreline, if you move away from the centrelline, however, still in the range of the localizer the DDM will increase. DDM = AM (90 hz) - AM (150 hz) / 100",

Now the VOR thinks that we want to fly that exact radial, but inbound to the beacon (we can therefore call it the \"048º TO\" course), so it is going to give us fly right/fly left indications from our current position (remember, it does not know our heading, it assumes we are heading in the correct direction). Therefore, a fly right indication means that we are to the left of that inbound track, so we are South-East of the \"048º TO\" course, which is the 228º radial.

The critical area is protected because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal-in-space; b) the ILS sensitive area is an area where the parking and/or movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.

            "explanation": "Very High Frequency Direction Finding (VDF) provides a means of determining the aircraft bearing from a ground station. VDF stations are capable of measuring the direction of arrival of radio transmissions from aircraft. Today, the service (for civil aviation) operates on frequencies from 118 to 137 MHz in the VHF band. These frequencies are identical with the working frequencies of the aircraft communication radio. One of the benefits of modern navigation and radio systems is that a pilot has the option of asking a suitably equipped ground station for his relative bearing to or from that particular ground station. This means that the pilot can determine his position (by using another VDF readout or NDB station) and heading more accurately should he become disorientated. Some aerodromes are equipped with radio aerials which can sense the direction of VHF-COM signals (i.e. normal voice signals) received from an aeroplane so the controller can then advise the pilot of his bearing relative to the aerodrome. An advantage of VDF is that no specific airborne equipment is required other than a VHF-COM, i.e. a normal VHF communications radio. A typical VDF air/ground exchange would be a pilot requesting ATC to provide his QDM (magnetic bearing to the ground station), followed by the controller advising it. By steering the QDM, the pilot is able to home to the ground station, i.e. head towards it. Consequently, ground stations that are equipped to provide VDF are designated by the term Homer. Whereas no special equipment is required in the aeroplane for VDF other than a VHF-COM radio, it does require a special installation at the ground station. Being a VHF transmission, the range is generally line of sight. The range will primarily depend on the height of the transmitter and the receiver. Some factors that will affect the expected range are: Intervening terrain that can screen the transmitter/receiver path Atmospheric refraction. An increased refractive index (resultant from the inversions of temperature and/or humidity) can cause super refraction and increased ranges. Transmitter power",

Learning Objective 062.02.02.05.02: State that static radiation energy from a cumulonimbus cloud may interfere with the radio wave and influence the ADF bearing indication. Thunderstorms can have very powerful discharges of static electricity across much of the electromagnetic spectrum including in Low Frequency (LF) and Medium Frequency (MF). These discharges cause the most severe errors in ADF receivers. A static discharge in a Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) can be heard as a loud crackle on the audio and the needle will move rapidly to the source of the CB. If there are several active thunderstorms in the area the needle might point to them for a longer period. As thunderstorms are incredibly powerful, the electromagnetic waves they give off can easily overpower that of an NDB, especially if it is only a low-power locator beacon.",

            "explanation": "To complete this question fully, you will need knowledge from many subjects. Thankfully, however, the answers have been made very far apart, which means that we can make some approximations along the way and still get the correct answer. This question has given us two locations with coordinates. With these types of questions, you must look for which coordinates are the same. In this case, the 036º15'S latitude is the same for both. Looking at the coordinates again, and remembering that 178ºE is actually to the West of 178ºW (as the 180ºE/W meridian lies close in between, where the E/W longitudes reverse, and start counting down the opposite hemisphere), the aircraft is directly West of the beacon*. The question asks for the direction the aircraft must fly for the DME groundspeed readout to read correctly. As the DME groundspeed readout uses \"rate of change of DME distance\" as the method for calculating groundspeed, then the only way for it to read correctly is by flying directly towards or directly away from the DME. Towards/Away from the VOR matters as well though, as the slant range becomes closer to the ground range the further we get from beacon, therefore it gets more accurate whilst flying away from the VOR. As the aircraft is directly True West from the beacon, then the aircraft would be flying on is whatever radial is True West of the VOR, so we must simply work out what magnetic radial corresponds to True West at the beacon. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 249º 21ºE (+) 270º We need to use the variation at the VOR as that is where the radial directions were decided, and emitted. Therefore, the aircraft must fly along radial 249º. *This is not strictly true, as VOR radials and DME pulses follow great circle tracks, and these include convergency due to the Earth's shape. The actual true radial outbound from the VOR would be 269º, making the final answer 248º in reality, but the answers give plenty of margin, and the question is much simpler without convergency.",

When on the approach, the sudden appearanc of both flags must mean a fault of some kind (not just being out of range), so this must be down to one of the faults listed in the learning objective above. The easiest fault to remember is correct in this case, as the sudden absence of a carrier wave is certainly going to remove LOC and GP indications and will therefore show warning flags. The other answers are wrong because: The difference in depth of modulation (DDM) is the way an ILS tells you where you are in relation to the localiser centreline or the glide path, and a DDM of zero means being exactly on the LOC or GP. \"Excessive LOC or GP deviations\" is vague, but even when at more than full scale deflection (but within the coverage area), the indicators still show the direction we are off track/glidepath. Loss of ident transmission would not show flags on its own, but there might be a common error which causes both flags to show and the ident to stop transmitting, such as a total power loss, etc.",

A pilot can make sure to be aligned with the correct approach path by maintaining the same QDM with the ADF, and can manage vertical guidance using their altimeter, with a minimum descent height/altitude. In terms of lateral errors permitted, flying an NDB approach, you must maintain a QDM/QDR that is ± 5° of the designated approach path.

If a further descent is specified after the inbound turn, this descent shall not be started until the aircraft is established on the inbound track. An aircraft is considered established when it is: A) within half full scale deflection for the ILS and VOR; or B) within ±5° of the required bearing for the NDB.",

The heading does not matter here, as we are using a CDI (course deviation indicator), which has no heading input at all. If you need to imagine a heading, imagine that you are heading whatever the OBS course is set to, as that is how to find the most intuitive use of the CDI. We must work out which of the course lines we are closest to, and it is obvious that we are closer to the 150º radial, which we have called 330 TO. This means that the \"TO\" indication will be showing on our CDI. Now the CDI thinks we want to fly the 330 TO track towards the VOR, so at the moment we are right of track, therefore, the CDI will show a \"fly left\" indication. As we are more than 10º off the track radial, then the CDI will show full deflection \"fly left\".",

            "explanation": "Navigational NDBs have an unmodulated carrier wave (ICAO classification N0N). Station identification is transmitted at roughly ten second intervals. Older systems interrupt the carrier wave (Keying) to send an unmodulated (but also inaudible) morse code ident (classified as A1A). User will have also erratic indications while the signal is interrupted in this type of beacon. To make the unmodulated parts of the A1A signal audible, ADF equipment incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BF0) that produces a signal slightly removed from the received frequency that is then mixed with it. The mixing of the two frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, tahat is the difference of the two. In aircraft whit old ADF receivers the BFO mode is activated and annunciated when the “BFO” button is depressed, and permits the carrier wave and the associated Morse code identifier broadcast on the carrier wave to be heard. In modern FMS equipped aircraft whit modern ADF receiver, the BFO is automatically activated. Summary: selecting the BFO on makes the N0N carrier wave audible and allows the A1A type of ident to be heard. Note: BFO is not needed for an A2A signal which is already modulated to an audible frequency.",

However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. During the day, the D-layer of the ionosphere absorbs signals in the LF and MF bands. At night, the D-layer disappears, allowing the sky wave to interfere with the surface wave. This interference occurs due to the different paths taken by the sky wave and surface wave, as well as the induction of currents in the horizontal elements of the loop aerial. The contamination effect, which is observed as fading of the audio signal and the needle 'hunting', is most pronounced around dawn and dusk when the ionosphere is transitioning. At shorter distances (30 to 80 miles), the sky waves combine with the ground wave signal without any dead space. Since the sky waves travel a different path, they have a different phase compared to the ground wave. As a result, the aerial null signal is suppressed or displaced in a random manner, leading to wandering of the needle on the RMI or RBI. This effect is called fading and is most variable during twilight at dawn and dusk.",

Remember, the deflection needle tells where the aircraft is relative to the selected course.

When within the coverage area of the ILS, and receiving the ident, that means that the carrier wave for the correct LOC is definitely being received, but showing flags for both LOC and GS is not what you would expect in normal operation. When flags are shown, it is due to any of the items listed in the LO above, or possibly due to the received signal being below a certain strength. This narrows down the possible failures to a modulation problem. Also, the other possible answers are wrong as: selected course does not affect ILS signals or indication. Any more than full scale deflection (within the coverage area) shows exactly that, full scale deflection. An aircraft ahead of yours might cause a momentary change in the ILS indication due to signal reflection, but this woud be a tiny blip indeed.",

Older systems interrupt the carrier wave (Keying) to send an unmodulated (but also inaudible) morse code ident (classified as A1A). User will have also erratic indications while the signal is interrupted in this type of beacon. To make the unmodulated parts of the A1A signal audible, ADF equipment incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BF0) that produces a signal slightly removed from the received frequency that is then mixed with it. The mixing of the two frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, tahat is the difference of the two. Summary: selecting the BFO on makes the N0N carrier wave audible and allows the A1A type of ident to be heard. Note: BFO is not needed for an A2A signal which is already modulated to an audible frequency.",

Our aircraft may be facing in any direction, but our RMI will not be able to tell us that. The ADF needle in the middle of the RMI is still working however, so will point directly towards the NDB we have tuned, but the number that it points to will not be the correct QDM, as it usually would be. Instead, we now have a fixed card ADF with a 90º offset. Mathematically, the offset means that the indication is 90º more than the relative bearing (take an indication of straight forwards, for example, which would show 090º, but the relative bearing is actually 000º). Therefore, mathematically, we can just do the indication minus 90º to give the relative bearing. 225 - 90 = 135º. Alternatively, you could draw out the compass rose and ADF needle, then count round the numbers from straight ahead (000º relative bearing - false 090º indication of course) until you have the relative bearing of the ADF needle. It would look like the above annex (green arrow only).",

As can be seen in the annex, the first time a full autoland can be completed (no decision height) is CAT III, meaning that this is the correct answer. Both CAT II and CAT III require a radio altimeter, and both have RVR requirements (except CAT IIIC, but this is only one section of CAT III minima), so all the other answers are incorrect. Please note that this annex uses the old system. We believe that EASA may be in the process of transitioning to the new system of minima.

The most extreme case of \"slant range error\" occurs when the aircraft passes directly over the station; instead of reading zero, the DME shows the altitude of the airplane above the station (in nautical miles). Slant range error also affects groundspeed and time-to-station displays when you're close to the station. Displayed DME groundspeed drops below actual groundspeed as you approach the station and then climbs back to normal after you pass it. Displayed DME time-to-station may not count all the way down to zero as you fly over the station.

These include ground station error, site effect error, error due to vertical polarisation effects and airborne equipment error. The algebraic sum of all these errors is known as the aggregate error. Ground station error. This is a systematic error associated with the transmitter, aerial and earth systems and power supply that is with the actual ground equipment. Error on a particular bearing is very small, and is plotted accurately on commissioning. It is similar to quadrantal error in an airborne ADF system. Ground station error, in practice, is usually less than ± 2°. Site effect error. There are, superimposed on the ground station error, site effects which are due to topographical features near the ground station. These site effects modify the ground station errors. The combined effect of these errors are determined at various altitudes at the time of commissioning and the overall error must be less than ± 3°. Terrain effects caused by the VOR radials being distorted by signals reflected from rough terrain may be experienced under certain circumstances. These effects are evidenced in the form of slow or quick oscillations of the deviation indicator. The VOR track is said to band or scallop depending on the rate of oscillation. Bends on VOR radials normally do not exceed 2° from the average alignment of the track and the scalloping amplitude must be less than ± 2°. Vertical polarization (altitude effects). If vertical polarisation effects are presented they are detected in manoeuvres which tilt the aircraft aerial, that is in a turn by an aircraft. When in a banked attitude, the receiving antenna on the aircraft, instead of sampling only the horizontally polarised VOR signals, may pick up large sloping obstructions. Under these circumstances, the deviation indicator is seen to move abnormally in either direction, thus giving rise to incorrect guidance information. Airborn equipment error. As the name implies, airborne equipment error is the error attributable to the various components of the VOR equipment in the aircraft. In well designed and built equipment it is generally less than ± 2°. Aggregate error. The algebraic sum of all the errors mentioned above is known as the aggregate error. It should be appreciated that procurement of precise figures on aggregate error, even on a probability basis, is extremely difficult if not impossible. However, the purpose in explaining the presence of these errors is to illustrate that the VOR is not a precision aid. It will be found that, in practice, aggregate errors greater than ± 5° are seldom encountered. It should be appreciated, too, that factors for aggregate error and for pilot error are used in the determination of standards used for aircraft separation purposes.",

The 2 ILS localiser lobes and the 2 glideslope lobes can cover a wide area, especially when further from the airfield. This is known as the ILS coverage area. Any obstacles within this area can reflect the ILS signals, potentially sending a different amount of one frequency to your ILS receiver than it should. This is called multipath interference and can cause an ILS display to show untrue fluctuations, in both the horizontal and the vertical. This can be especially dangerous when connected to autopilot, which could pitch or roll excessively due to the ILS fluctuations.",

Type B instrument approach operations are categorized as: 1) Category I (CAT I): a decision height not lower than 60 m (200 ft) and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual range not less than 550 m; 2) Category II (CAT II): a decision height lower than 60 m (200 ft) but not lower than 30 m (100 ft) and a runway visual range not less than 300 m; 3) Category III (CAT III): a decision height lower than 30 m (100 ft) or no decision height and a runway visual range less than 300 m or no runway visual range limitations; This is new from 2018, and categorises instrument approaches into type A or type B depending on their decision height (or minimum descent height) being above or below 250ft. As the approach in question is an ILS, which has both horizontal and vertical guidance, it is therefore a 3-dimensional (3D) approach, and its decision height is below 250 ft, so it is \"type B\".

Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. The sky wave propagation develops at night and extends the range of LF/MF frequencies. The sky wave is the result of reflection in the ionosphere, the upper layers of the atmosphere, at an altitude between 100 and 300 km. NDB range is increased, but VOR and DME range are less impacted. While range is increased by the sky wave, perturbations appear, changing the relative bearing of the NBD signal, decreasing accuracy.

            "explanation": "The principles of operation of Microwaves Landing Systems (MLS) are actually quite simple to understand. There are 2 main (and 1 extra) transmitters providing information to the aircraft. The first one provides information about how far an aircraft is horizontally from the correct inbound course, called azimuth guidance (similar to ILS localiser). The second one provides similar information about how far the aircraft is from the correct glide path, called elevation guidance. There is a third transmitter that is used to allow curved and segmented MLS procedures to take place also, called the DME/P, which is a more precise version of a standard DME. With this in use also, the aircraft can have the knowledge of its 3-dimensional position for much more complex (not straight-in) approaches. The azimuth and elevation transmitters work in the same way, they emit a beam that \"scans\" the sky, side-to-side (to and fro) for the azimuth guidance, up-and-down for the elevation beam. The aircraft then detects how much time passed inbetween the beams being detected, (between the \"to\" and the \"fro\" beam, for instance), and can very accurately detect its angular distance from the inbound course/glide path. The azimuth beam does not constantly scan to-fro-to-fro., but has a break whilst the elevation beam does it's own scan, and they alternate with each other. (with data being passed also through the frequency at set intervals).",

CAT II and CAT III operations require high accuracy standards. The aircraft flying CAT II or CAT III approaches follow the ILS LOC and GP signals, and based on these signals they are flown down to a low height above the touchdown, or even all the way to the touchdown, depending on the category. Since on precision approaches CAT II and III the system is capable of bringing the aircraft too low or even on touchdown, measures need to be taken to ensure that their signals will not be affected by interference of any kind. ILS localizer and glide slope signals are radio waves, and can therefore be affected by interference. The most common type of interference for ILS signals are multi-path interference and beam-bends. These can happen for a multitude of reasons, but primarily, due to the reflections of the radio waves off buildings, terrain, vehicles, etc. An aircraft waiting too close to the runway may affect the quality of the ILS signals, making it harder for the landing aircraft to maintain its course and height accurately. Therefore, a separate holding position is required to ensure that the signals are not affected by other aircraft movements. This is the reason that, during LVOs (Low Visibility Operations) - CAT II/III approaches, at many airports, aircraft are required to use different holding points, further from the runway, in order to remain outside the ILS-sensitive area (also known as the LSA - Localiser Sensitive Area).",

            "explanation": "The modulation type of all ILS transmitters is the good old amplitude modulation (AM). The carrier oscillation in the localizer frequency range is 108.00 MHz to 111.975 MHz modulated with a 90Hz and a 150Hz tone signal. The ILS works by sending 2 beams up from the landing runway, one telling the pilots if they or high or low and the other telling them if they are left or right of the runway centreline. The ILS receiver on the aircraft measures the difference in depth of modulation (DDPM) between the signals For most ILS’s the pilots should be lined up with the runway centreline and on a 3 degree glide path, but on some ILS’s, like London City have a steeper approach of 5.5 degrees. This two modulated signals are produced from a horizontally polarized antenna complex beyond the far end of the approach runway. They create an expanding field that is 21⁄2° wide (about 1,500 feet) 5 miles from the runway. The field tapers to runway width near the landing threshold. The left side of the approach area is filled with a VHF carrier wave modulated with a 90 Hz signal. The right side of the approach contains a 150 MHz modulated signal. The aircraft’s VOR receiver is tuned to the localizer VHF frequency that can be found on published approach plates and aeronautical charts. The circuitry specific to standard VOR reception is inactive while the receiver uses localizer circuitry and components common to both. The signals received are passed through filters and rectified into DC to drive the course deviation indicator. If the aircraft receives a 150 Hz signal, the CDI of the VOR/ILS display deflects to the left. This indicates that the runway is to the left. The pilot must correct course with a turn to the left. This centers course deviation indicator on the display and centers the aircraft with the centerline of the runway. If the 90 Hz signal is received by the VOR receiver, the CDI deflects to the right. The pilot must turn toward the right to center the CDI and the aircraft with the runway center line. (annex1) Like the localizer, the glideslope transmits two signals, one modulated at 90 Hz and the other modulated at 150 Hz. The aircraft’s glideslope receiver deciphers the signals similar to the method of the localizer receiver. It drives a vertical course deviation indicator known as the glideslope indicator. The glideslope indicator operates identically to the localizer CDI only 90° to it. The VOR/ILS localizer CDI and the glideslope are displayed together on whichever kind of instrumentation is in the aircraft (annex2)",

In this mode, the pulse repetition rate can be increased up to 150 ppps (ppps = pulse pairs per second) to speed up the search process, much more than in track mode. DME and TACAN ground stations always send out a certain number of pulses per second (squitter pulses and replies to requests of planes).

After tuning the frequency of a DME (Distance Measuring Equipment), or any radio nav-aid for that matter, the signal must be identified, before it can be used for navigation. This can be done by correctly identifying the morse code signal produced by the nav-aid. A VOR for instance produces a morse code identifier at least every 20 seconds which has a pitch frequency of 1 020 Hz (as does an ILS localiser). A DME has a higher pitched tone of 1 350 Hz for its morse code identifier, and produces one at least every 40 seconds. Often you will see a co-located VOR/DME or ILS/DME, and they usually have 10 second intervals between identification codes, with the first 3 being the VOR/ILS and the 4th being the DME (at a higher pitch), then repeat. Hence, in that case, the DME identifiers are once every 40 seconds, and the VOR/ILSs are three times per 40 second cycle.",

The TO/FROM indicator shows a 'TO' indication, and the deflection of the CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) is 6º to the left. The 'TO' indication shows that if the aircraft follows the course of 184º, the aircraft will fly towards the AMS VOR. Since the aircraft will be directed towards the VOR, the desired course will be the reciprocal of the desired radial (radials are FROM the VOR). The desired course is 184º, so the desired radial is 184º - 180º = 004º. The aircraft is 6º away from its desired course, which means that it is 6 radials away from the desired radial. The CDI deflection is to the left, which means that the desired course is to the left. The desired radial is the reciprocal of the desired course, so left deflection also means that the desired radial is to the right. So the aircraft is currently on the radial 004º - 6º = - 002º. Since there are no negative radials, we will add 360º to the result and the radial will be - 002º + 360º = 358º. So the aircraft is currently on radial 358º.",

However, there are few MLS installations in use at present and they are likely to co-exist with ILS for a long time. MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features: There are 200 channels available worldwide. The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glideslopes from.9° to 20° can be selected. The usable range is 20-30 nm from the MLS site; 20nm in the UK. There is no problem with back-course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a range of 10 nm and a height of 10,000 ft. It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090 MHZ. This enables it to be sited in hilly areas without having to level the site. Course deviation errors (bending) of the localiser and glidepath caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections",

We previously assumed that deviation should not be applied, but it appears that some authorities are assuming it to be applied, so now we are applying it. We think that this is an error which could be appealed, but we have not heard of a successful appeal of this question yet. To work out the answer, we need to identify which of the needles is pointing at the NDB in question. In the bottom left of the instrument, the yellow needle is pointing at \"ADF\", and the green needle at \"NAV\", so the yellow needle is the one we wish to use. The head of the yellow ADF needle is pointing directly at the NDB, so that is our QDM, the magnetic bearing towards the beacon. We find the reciprocal of that number (or look at the tail of the needle) to find the QDR, the magnetic bearing (well technically the compass bearing if we are applying deviation - see the note above) from the beacon to our aircraft. We now need to adjust that for the deviation and variation using the following phrases: Deviation West, Compass Best Variation East, Magnetic Least Or using the following table. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 192° 2°E (+2°) 194° 5°E (+5°) 199°",

It is a series of standard dipole antennas in a circle, each receiving the incoming wave in slightly different phase. The system (or operator) can then calculate which direction the signal is coming from. Skilled radio operators can also use the older style equipment to give a classification of how accurate the bearing was, Class A, class B, etc. This can give the ground radio operator an idea of the location of some aircraft when RADAR is not available, however, that is not a very common usage as far as we can tell.",

A Broadcast VOR is usually a terminal aid with a voice broadcast giving out the airfield weather (ATIS) superimposed on the carrier wave. A Test VOR (VOT) is a very low power beacon sited at airfields. It puts out a constant phase difference of zero in all directions. This allows aircraft to test the accuracy of their equipment on the ground. The VOR test function is selected with a course of 000° set.

As seen in the figure the aircraft is homing to the VOR station on heading 360. However this is the heading needed to fly directly to the station without taking into account the experienced drift. The direction of drift depends on the direction of the wind. To correct for the drift angle, a wind correction angle is needed. The wind correction is always against the wind, so left wind, left wind correction angle. Right wind, right wind correction angle. As general rule: When the aircraft experiences right drift, meaning a wind from the left, the track will be heading + drift angle When the aircraft experiences left drift, meaning a wind from the right, the track will be heading – drift angle If heading 360 is selected but the track indicates heading 010, the aircraft will not reach the station.

VORs and ILSs often use the same displays in the cockpit, with the lateral display of the CDI (course deviation indicator) useful for displaying VOR or Localiser deviation, and the vertical display showing glide path deviation. They do not, however, have the same level of accuracy, as a localiser has to be much more accurate than a VOR (4 times more accurate). Therefore, on a standard 5 dot CDI, VORs have a deviation indicated by 2 degrees per dot, so full scale deflection is 10° deviation from the selected bearing. ILS Localisers (LOC) on the other hand have just 0.5 degrees per dot deviation, so full scale deflection is 2.5° deviation from the localiser centreline. Therefore, in this scenario, where we are on exactly full scale VOR deflection, we are 10° off the correct inbound course, which is more than full scale deflection on the Localiser CDI, which will show as full scale deflection (as we are still within the ILS coverage area due to the fact that we are on approach).",

            "explanation": "The needle of an ADF always points towards the NDB that it is tuned into. Relative bearings are measured from the aircraft heading (to the NDB). When tracking towards a NDB, the relative bearing equals to 360 degrees minus wind correction angle. When tracking away from a NDB, the relative bearing equals to 180 degrees minus wind correction angle. Note the wind correction angle is added to track to give headings. It can be seen that the head or tail of the needle need not be pointing straight up when there’s wind to correct for. Hence “Once the aircraft is established on the depicted track the head or tail of the needle will point straight up on the instrument regardless of wind conditions.” is not the correct option. Even if there’s no wind, the head of the needle will be pointing at 180 degrees (relative to the top of the instrument) when tracking outbound of NDB. Thus “The head of the needle will be pointing at 3600 when the aircraft is established on the inbound or outbound track.” is incorrect. From the diagram it is clear that relative bearing only equals to the magnitude of the wind correction angle when tracking inbound and the wind correction angle is negative. Therefore, “The relative bearing will be equal to the wind correction angle required to maintain the depicted track towards or away from the NDB.” is incorrect as well. The only option left is “The head or tail of the needle may point slightly left or right of the top of the instrument when maintaining the appropriate QDM or QDR.” which is correct when crosswind is light. When crosswind is strong, the head or tail of the needle may point significantly from the left or right of the instrument though when maintaining the appropriate QDM or QDR. However, it is the most sensible answer choice present in this question.",

Surface waves are the preferred method of propagation, as they retain their direction and polarisation better.

There are 2 different nav-aids which operate in the VHF-NAV band, which spans from 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz. VORs and ILSs (specifically the ILS localisers). The VHF-NAV frequency band is split into frequencies with 50 kHz spacing, so 108.000 MHz, 108.050 MHz, 108.100 MHz, etc. ILS localiser frequencies are less common, and have smaller range, so less chance of 2 nearby frequencies interfering. They therefore require less available frequencies, and only use the band from 108 - 112 MHz.

            "explanation": "The Difference in Depth Modulation (DDM) is a principle used by the ILS to define a position in an airspace. The deviation detection of the aircraft from the desired track is based on two different overlapping lobes. These lobes are radiated by both the localiser and the glide path antennas. These consist of a 90 Hz lobe and a 150 Hz lobe. For the glide path: When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 90 Hz lobe than the 150 Hz lobe, it means that the aircraft is above the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When the airborne receiver receives a stronger signal from the 150 Hz lobe than the 90 Hz lobe, the aircraft will be below the ‘ideal’ glideslope. When both the signals received are at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the ‘ideal’ glideslope and the glideslope needle will indicate zero. For the localiser, the same method is used: stronger signals from the 90 Hz lobe means a displacement to the left. Whereas stronger signals from the 150 Hz lobe means a right displacement in relation to the centreline. When both the signals received are at the same strength it means the aircraft will be on the centreline and the localiser needle will indicate zero. Assume that you are on the centreline, if you move away from the centrelline, however, still in the range of the localizer the DDM will increase. DDM = AM (90 hz) - AM (150 hz) / 100 Therefore, once you go off centreline, either the 90 or 150 increases, causing DDM to increase (negative is also assumed to be an increase).",

It will even be put on the localiser track if there is to be a visual circle to land later in the approach, as that procedure is done visually, the more important aide memoir would still be the localiser track, not the runway track.

Warning flags indicate that the required signals cannot be correctly or sufficiently received. You will get a LOC flag when no signal is received, or when there is no modulation in the signal. If the incorrect ILS frequency is selected, then it is most likely that no signals on that frequency are being received, so the flag will be seen and may go out if the correct frequency is selected, so 1 is correct. If the signal is not strong enough, then flags will also show, so when the signal becomes stronger, the flags will go out, so 2 is also correct. When you get within the coverage area, the modulation will start to be detected by the receiver, whereas it is not assured outside of the coverage area, so the flags will also go out, so 3 is correct. The flags should not occur when the aircraft gets more than half-scale deflection as that is still well within the coverage area. Half-scale deflection is when the aircraft leaves the protected area and must go around.",

            "explanation": "VOR ground stations transmit two separate signals, one is the reference signal, and the other is the variphase signal. The principle of operation of Conventional VORs (CVORs) is that the reference signal is omnidirectional, so all positions receive the signal equally, but the variphase signal is transmitted by a spinning antenna, so it appears at each position (radial) at a different time in comparison to the reference signal. Radio waves like this are not pulses though, they are continuous sine waves, therefore the difference we measure between the reference signal and the variphase signal is a phase difference, simply put, a timing difference, that can be measured to give the receiver their VOR radial. The two signals are easy to compare against each other as they are the same frequency, but differently modulated so both can be picked up separately. In a CVOR, the reference signal is FM (Frequency Modulated) and the variphase signal is AM (Amplitude Modulated). In a DVOR, the reference signal is AM, and the variphase signal is FM. DVOR stands for Doppler VOR, and they are much bigger ground units (with larger antennas), that use the opposite modulation to CVORs, and their variphase signal comes from a single omnidirectional signal that is sent to a ring of different antennas - see annex above - one at a time, travelling round the circle, to create a virtual \"travelling antenna\". This causes a doppler frequency shift of the signal, depending on the aircraft's VOR radial. This can then be compared to the AM reference signal in the same airborne receivers as for CVORs to provide a radial, which is then used in standard VOR displays. Because the aircraft does not know which type it is using, DVORs are slightly modified (signal spins the opposite direction), so it acts the same as a CVOR to a receiver. DVORs are more common these days, as they are less prone to site errors due to multipath errors and interference. This is because their variphase signal is FM, which is much less prone to interference from other signals that bounce off surfaces nearby to the line-of-sight signal. Amplitude Modulation, on the other hand, has some strong interference effects from interference and reflected radio waves. As the variphase signal is the one which counts in this respect (for reasons well above the syllabus), DVORs are less prone to site and multipath errors. Note: In the past a question like this has been seen that mention larger, more powerful signals as the reason DVORs are better. This is not true, as bigger antennas will help a little bit, but that is not the primary reason they are less prone to errors than CVORs.",

Knowing that the ground distance to the station is 5 nm, the slant range (DME indication) can be calculated by using the following: FL300 = 30.000 ft = 4.9 nm = 5 nm. The slant range can be used by using the following the pythagoras theorem: Slant range = √((Ground distance)²+(Aircraft height)2) Slant range = √((5 nm)²+(5 nm)²) = 7 nm.",

However, there are few MLS installations in use at present and they are likely to co-exist with ILS for a long time. MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features: There are 200 channels available worldwide. The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glideslopes from.9° to 20° can be selected. The usable range is 20 nm from the MLS site. There is no problem with back-course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a range of 10 nm and a height of 10,000 ft. It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090 MHZ. This enables it to be sited in hilly areas without having to level the site. Course deviation errors (bending) of the localiser and glidepath caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections",

            "explanation": "062.01.01.03.04: State that the following abbreviations (classifications according to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations) are used for aviation applications: N0N: carrier without modulation as used by non-directional radio beacons (NDBs); A1A: carrier with keyed Morse code modulation as used by NDBs; A2A: carrier with amplitude modulated Morse code as used by NDBs; A3E: carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for communication (VHF-COM). To identify a modulated NDB station, the carrier wave is modulated in amplitude (A2A) with a tone of 400 or 1 020 Hz, which provides the Morse code for identification. To listen to the identification of an unmodulated NON-A1A NDB, the pilot must activate a system known as the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) by switching it ON. The BFO remains active as long as the beacon is in use for navigation. This allows the pilot to identify the NDB station. Let's analyze each option separately: \"In case of A3 modulation, use the VHF-COM function.\" Incorrect. The onboard ADF equipment does not have a VHF-COM function. Additionally, A3 modulation is utilized in VHF communications, not in NDB navigation. \"In case of N0N modulation, use the BFO function.\" Incorrect. While all NDB stations transmit N0N carrier waves, the BFO is only necessary when the wave type includes A1A modulation. Therefore, for N0N A2A transmissions, which are still a type of N0N wave, the BFO is not required. \"In case of A2 modulation, use the ADF function.\" Correct. The ADF function represents the standard operational mode of ADF equipment. When selected, it enables the pilot to hear the identification signals of N0N A2A transmissions. \"In case of A1 modulation, use the ANT function.\" Incorrect. In most light aircraft equipped with ADF equipment, the antenna (ANT) function is activated when the ADF button is in the OUT position. This function is used to test the ADF equipment and improve the audio reception of identifications from NDB stations that transmit N0N A2A signals. While the ANT function is selected, the ADF needle will be deactivated and will rotate 90º from its current indication.",

This allows aircraft to test the accuracy of their equipment on the ground.

(DR --> Direction Reciprocal) In this case, we are using a Relative Bearing Indicator (RBI), which simply uses a fixed card (pointed North-up) and an ADF pointer on top, giving a bearing towards the NDB relative to the direction the aircraft is pointing. It is easier in this configuration to imagine the ADF pointer on top of the nearby Direction Indicator (DI), to effectively make it into an RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator), which is a more complex instrument that covers both functions. The RBI can also be used mathematically by adding the relative bearings to the current magnetic heading, to find the QDM of the aircraft. The QDM of the aircraft is represented by the head of the needle (when using an RMI, or by imagining the RBI on top of the DI in this question), and the QDR is the reciprocal, so the tail of the needle. For example, currently the DI is at a heading of 120°, and the RBI is showing 90° to the left of the nose, (Relative Bearing 270°), so the QDM is 030° (see one of the annexes above for a visual representation). This makes the tail of the needle, and therefore QDR, currently 210°. Now lets try each possible answer (all degrees are in magnetic): Maintaining a heading of 120° would not bring us any closer to having a QDM of 240° (Radial 060°). Maintaining a heading of 120° would also not bring us any closer to having a QDR of 240° (Radial 240°). Turning onto a heading of 210° would mean we stay on our radial, and therefore maintain our current QDM and QDR, and our QDM is currently 210°, not 030° Turning onto a heading of 030° would also mean that we stay on our radial, and therefore maintain our current QDM and QDR, our QDM is 030°, so this answer is correct!",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The current correct option is technically wrong. Kindly consult ICAO Annex 10 (3.5.4.7.2.5). Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a type of secondary radar system that provides slant range using the pulse technique. The aircraft’s interrogator transmits a stream of psuedo-random omni-directional pulse pairs on the carrier frequency of the ground transponder. The ground transponder then receives these, waits 50 microseconds, and repeats those pulse pairs outwards at a frequency 63 MHz above the interrogation frequency. The airborne system identifies its own unique stream of pulse pairs and measures the time of arrival electronically, between the start of the interrogation and the reception of the ground transponder's replies. As there is only one interrogation frequency and one reply frequency for each DME ground station, they can only service a certain number of pulses per second, and it ends up meaning that the DME becomes saturated with around 100 aircraft using it, and it will then prioritise the pulses with the strongest signal. Aircraft attempting to search for a DME emit 150 pulses per second, but after 15000 pulses, reduce that to 60 pulses per second, and later on to 24 pulses per second when fully \"locked on\". As the DME can only handle 2700 pulses per second reliably, this ends up being approximately 100 aircraft, some searching, some locked on. Once locked on, if the aircraft \"loses\" the DME replies at any time, then the equipment will go into memory mode, which maintains the DME range changing at the same rate for up to 8-10 seconds, before dropping out completely into search mode. This is useful for when the ident sounds every 40 seconds, as no pulses are sent during that time. It is also useful for momentary interruptions such as this question.",

The CDI indicates which direction the aircraft should fly to get on the desired track, and the amount of deviation. We call these \"fly left\" and \"fly right\" indications, depending on which way the indicator goes. You can have 2 dot displays (where full deflection either direction is only 2 dots), but more common on training aircraft is a 5 dot display, so you can see the deflection more accurately. On either display, VORs have a full scale deflection of 10º, meaning that each dot (on a 5-dot display) is a 2º deviation. ILS Localisers, on the other hand, are much more accurate, with a full scale deflection of only 2.5º, meaning that each dot (on a 5-dot display) is worth only 0.5º of deviation. This is 4 x more accurate than VORs In this question, the indicator is deflected 2 dots to the right. We call this a \"fly right\" indication, and it means that our aircraft is 2 dots (2 x 0.5º = 1º) left of the localiser course.",

Coastal Refraction affects NDB/ADF equipment due to the type of carrier wave that NDBs transmit. They transmit between 190 and 1750 kHz, which is partly in the LF band and partly in the MF band. These waves travel as surface waves, which are massively affected by the surface they are travelling over. Water is much smoother to travel over than land, so the waves are able to travel a bit faster. This creates a change in speed when NDB carrier waves go from land to sea, which can cause a process called refraction, meaning that the beam bends away from the perpendicular (called the normal) and therefore creates the image shown in the annex. This means that the carrier wave arrives at our aircraft from a slightly different direction than it should, and our ADF therefore reads incorrectly. The best way to stop this is to place NDBs very close to the coast (thereby reducing the error), or to take ADF readings when the signal crosses the coast at a right angle (perpendicular). The closer to the perpendicular, the less refraction will occur, and so is less affected by the coastal effect.",

There are 2 different nav-aids which operate in the VHF-NAV band, which spans from 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz. VORs and ILSs (specifically the ILS localisers). The VHF-NAV frequency band is split into frequencies with 50 kHz spacing, so 108.000 MHz, 108.050 MHz, 108.100 MHz, etc. ILS localiser frequencies are less common, and have smaller range, so less chance of 2 nearby frequencies interfering. They therefore require less available frequencies, and only use the band from 108 - 112 MHz.

This may have been a different question; as yet we do not know, so please let us know what you see in the exam, if either of these do come up. The problems here are numerous. Firstly, this question is different depending on whether you are taking ICAO information or EASA Air Ops information (we usually tend towards EASA air ops as the exams are EASA exams and air ops are written into law). That leads to us having the information below, where only CAT IIIB has \"no DH\", and CAT IIIA does not (fail passive and fail operational make the minimums very complicated indeed, but this is the basics). The even bigger problem is that this information is now outdated, as in November 2022, EASA Air Ops changed, and got rid of CAT IIIA, B and C in favour of a simpler system.

            "explanation": "First, we must calculate our true heading, then we can use our relative bearing to calculate our true bearing from the NDB (sometimes called a QTE). To calculate our true heading, we can use the saying \"Cadbury's Dairy Milk Very Tasty\" which is popular within British aviation schools. Also an option is \"TV Makes Dumb Children\" which is a reversal of the other saying. There is a universal method which can be used that applies to both directions. Compass - Deviation - Magnetic - Variation - True. To get our compass heading into a magnetic heading, we apply the deviation using the rhyme: Deviation West, Compass Best Deviation East, Compass Least We must also know that a positive value is Easterly, and a negative value is Westerly (it can be given in either format), so in this case our compass heading is 2º more than our magnetic heading, so our magnetic heading is 348º - 2º = 346º. Now to get true heading, we apply variation to our magnetic value using the rhyme: Variation West, Magnetic Best Variation East, Magnetic Least We now know that our magnetic heading is 22º more than our true heading, so true heading = 346º - 22º = 324º. With this in mind, we can apply the relative bearing to our true heading, which is simply a case of adding the two together. true heading + relative bearing = 324º + 317º = 641º (which isn't possible, so subtract 360º) ---> 281º 281º is therefore the true bearing from the aircraft to the NDB. We want to find the opposite direction to this, so we shall simply add or subtract 180º, giving us 101º true bearing from the NDB to the aircraft.

They are a bit off the learning objectives for RNAV but have been reported many times in RNAV exams. In a procedural approach, often an aircraft will need to perform a reversal manoeuvre, in order to get from an outbound track to an inbound track. There are many different ways this can be done, and the chosen method will be dictated clearly on the approach plate. Some of the available methods are the 45-180 procedure turn, the racetrack pattern, base turns, and the 80-260 procedure turn. The one in question has started with a 45° turn, so must be the 45-180 procedure turn. See the annexes above for the specific manoeuvre and the other main reversal procedures. ICAO Doc 8168 3.2.2 Reversal procedure 3.2.2.3 a) 45°/180° procedure turn ( starts at a facility or fix and consists of: 1) a straight leg with track guidance. This straight leg may be timed or may be limited by a radial or distance measuring equipment (DME) distance; 2) a 45° turn; 3) a straight leg without track guidance. This straight leg is timed. It is: i) 1 minute from the start of the turn for Category A and B aircraft; and ii) 1 minute 15 seconds from the start of the turn for Category C, D and E aircraft; and 4) a 180° turn in the opposite direction to intercept the inbound track.",

The VHF-NAV frequency band is split into frequencies with 50 kHz spacing, so 108.000 MHz, 108.050 MHz, 108.100 MHz, etc. ILS localiser frequencies are less common, and have smaller range, so less chance of 2 nearby frequencies interfering. They therefore require less available frequencies, and only use the band from 108 - 112 MHz. Within this range, they only use the odd numbered decimals (and odd +50kHz), so ILSs would be allocated onto frequencies such as: 108.500 MHz, 108.55 MHz, 111.900 MHz, 111.950 MHz, etc. but VORs would be allocated the even decimals, and the evens plus 50 kHz, such as: 108.600 MHz, 108.65 MHz, 110.200MHz, and; all frequencies between 112 MHz and 117.95 MHz, so 112.200 MHz, 113.250 MHz, 115.300 MHz, etc. Let's check each of the frequencies from the question: \"118.10 MHz\" - Incorrect, as this would be an ILS localiser frequency. \"113.00 MHz\" - Correct. \"118.00 MHz\" - Incorrect, as the VHF-NAV frequencies stop at 117.95 MHz, and do not go any higher. \"121.00 MHz\" - Incorrect, as this is too high a frequency, and is well within the VHF-COM band. For this question, the fact that it is a DVOR (doppler VOR) makes no difference from a normal VOR.",

This can give them: QDM - Magnetic bearing from the aircraft to the station. QDR - Magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft. QUJ - True bearing from the aircraft to the station. QTE - True bearing from the station to the aircraft. With 2 suitable bearings from different ground stations, there is enough information to calculate a location of an aircraft, whether that is the pilot drawing on a chart and finding the location, or the controllers on the ground using their system. More bearings provide a more accurate location, and the best bearings are where the lines cross at close to 90º. This means that the two VDF ground stations are required, that are not too close together. These days, a computer system with access to multiple VDF aerials can perform a process called auto-triangulation to find the exact location that a particular transmission was broadcast from. This is most notably used by Distress and Diversion (121.5 MHz).",

            "explanation": "The aircraft transmits a stream of pairs of pulses to the ground station (the two pulses in each pair are separated by 12 micro seconds). After a short delay of 50 microseconds the ground station, called transponder, retransmits them. The time delay between sending and receiving the pulses is converted to a range readout. The aeroplane must distinguish between its own pulses returning and those of other aircraft,so the pulse trains are made unique to each aeroplane by using a random or \"jittered\" PRF. Therefore the time interval between the paired pulses is random and the chance of two pulse trains being identical is effectively nil. The Reply Signal, on being received at the aircraft, is checked by the Echo Protection Circuit (EPC) to ensure the PRF received is the same as that transmitted, to eliminate the possibility that it is a reply to another interrogating aircraft.",

You can twist your paper to look in this direction for the easiest understanding, you will want to be looking along the 060º radial away from the VOR. As we have half scale \"fly left\" indication, which means 5º fly left to get onto the course, we can draw our aircraft as being 5º right of the selected outbound course, meaning that we are on radial 065. At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 010º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle on 065º, which is Figure A. Variation is not a factor as the CDI, RMI and VOR radials are all in magnetic.",

Since ADF receivers do not have a \"flag\" to warn the pilot when erroneous bearing information is being displayed, the pilot should continuously monitor the NDB's identification. When the NDB itself fails, the pilot might notice a searching needle on their display - much like when it is out of range of the receiver. This is not a very reliable failure indication, so the pilot should continuously monitor the NDB's morse code identifier, which would stop transmitting in the event of an NDB failure, and would be a much more timely method of noticing a failure. This is obviously not a nice thing to do, as it is often a very annoying identifier noise, another reason NDBs are such a bad navigational aid in modern times.",

And one lobe at 150 Hz which indicates that the aircraft is below the glidepath. The centre is typically set to a 3° glidepath. This is not a perfect system, and the glidepath can suffer from the presence of \"false glidepaths\" above the correct one. These are due to both the weak sidelobes of the original 150 Hz and 90 Hz lobes, but also due to the reflection of the lower signals off the ground, or nearby obstacles. This is the same as the multipath interference of the localiser, but is often much more powerful. These false glidepaths can be reverse sensing (see annex above) and usually exist at odd multiples of the original glidepath, and are the reason why we procedurally will intercept the glidepath from below, to avoid encountering a false glidepath. In this question, we are \"high above the glide path\", which could mean that we would be picking up false glide path signals. This would cause the autopilot to try and follow these signals (as we have put it in approach mode (APP)). This can lead to some very strange flying, particularly due to the reverse sensing nature of some of the false glide paths, and this scenario has actually happened to aircraft in the past.",

ILS signals have to be extremely accurate during CAT II and CAT III operations, as aircraft are being automatically flown down all the way to touchdown, by reference to only the ILS LOC and GP signals. This means that they have to be exact, and cannot be affected by interference of any kind. ILS localisers and glide paths are radio waves like any other, and can therefore be affected by interference. The most common type of interference for ILSs is that of multi-path interference and beam-bends. These can happen for a multitude of reasons, but primarily, due to the reflections of the radio waves off buildings, terrain, vehicles, etc. This is particularly true for aircraft; they are huge, shiny, round metal objects that can cause a lot of interference to ILS signals. This is the reason that, during LVOs (Low Visibility Operations) - CAT II/III approaches, at many airports, aircraft are required to use different holding points, further from the runway, in order to remain outside the ILS-sensitive area (also known as the LSA - Localiser Sensitive Area).",

The airway in question has a VOR on each end, and each provides an accuracy of better than 5.5º. That accuracy has to be able to keep us within the 10 nm wide airway, so allows 5 nm on either side of the centre. Now we have a trigonometry problem with a 5 nm allowable error, a 5.5º angle, and we wish to know the distance to this mid point (which is where we switch over from the first VOR to the second one). Luckily, we do not have to use proper trigonometry, and instead can use the 1-in-60 rule, a very useful rule of thumb for small angles. 1-in-60 rule: Track Error Angle = (Distance off track/Distance along track) x 60 Rearranged to find the distance along track, it is: Distance along track = (Distance off track/track error angle) x 60 Therefore: Half distance = (5 / 5.5) x 60 = 54.5 nm Thus, total distance is 54.5 x 2 = 109 nm, closest answer 105 nm.

When the ground wave crosses a shoreline and moves out to sea, it bends towards the coast. Coastal Refraction: Changes In Conductivity From Land To Sea Electrical differences between land and sea affect radio waves. As low frequency waves cross the shoreline, they move abruptly from an area of low conductivity (land) to an area of high conductivity (water). That rapid change in conductivity changes the radio wave's \"phase velocity.\" What's that? Imagine the crest of a wave moving across the ocean - the speed that the crest moves is the wave's phase velocity. Radio waves are no different. As the phase velocity changes, the wave's frequency (what you dialed into the radio receiver) stays the same. To decrease this error pilot must use : stations closer to the coast stations that produce signal crossing the cost-line as close to 90° as possible use higher cruising altitude as the refraction error decreases with altitude Note: The laws of conservation of energy and momentum come into play, and the wave bends. This is called refraction. For a more in-depth look at the physics, check out Snell's law.",

The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, 3 of the provided figures of ND are expanded modes, and only figure 1 is a 360° compass rose VOR mode. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. The above point allows you to select the correct answer. However, just as a crosscheck you can look for other indications that would confirm you Figure 1 is the correct answer. As you can see, it has the VOR indication at the bottom left-hand corner and its frequency on the right (114.75). A course deviation scale is also displayed and further confirms that the given ND is a VOR mode display with a VOR frequency selected.",

For the conventional VOR, the phase of the 30 Hz component of the FM subcarrier is fixed without respect to azimuth. It is termed the “reference phase”.

Looking at the coordinates again, the aircraft is directly North (True North) of the beacon. The question asks for the direction the aircraft must fly for the DME groundspeed readout to read correctly. As the DME groundspeed readout uses \"rate of change of DME distance\" as the method for calculating groundspeed, then the only way for it to read correctly is by flying directly towards or directly away from the DME. Towards/Away from the VOR does not matter though, as the radial is the same one no matter which direction we fly along it. As the aircraft is directly True North from the beacon, then the radial that the aircraft would be flying on is whatever is True North of the VOR, so we must simply work out what magnetic radial corresponds to True North at the beacon. Compass Deviation Magnetic Variation True 346º 14ºE (+) 000/360º We need to use the variation at the VOR as that is where the radial directions were decided, and emitted. Therefore, the aircraft must fly along radial 346º",

Explain the following in accordance with ICAO Doc 8168: the accuracy the pilot has to fly the ILS LOC to be considered established on an ILS track is within the half-full scale deflection of the required track; the pilot has to fly the ILS GP to a maximum of half-scale fly-up deflection of the GP in order to stay in protected airspace. The Instrument Landing System (ILS) serves as an approach and landing aid, offering pilots precise guidance during instrument approaches to runways. It provides guidance in both the horizontal (localiser signal) and vertical (glide-slope signa) dimensions, making it a precision approach system. Additionally, ILS supports automatic landings. In the cockpit, ILS furnishes visual instructions to the pilot, enabling them to navigate the aircraft along a predetermined glide path and an extended runway centerline (known as the localizer) until reaching the Decision Height (DH). Full scale deflection of the localiser needle indicates that the aircraft is 2.5° or more left or right of the centre-line. During an approach, if the left/right deflections (localiser) or the fly-up indications (glideslope) exceed half full scale then an immediate go-around should be initiated because safe terrain clearance may be compromised. If the aircraft is within the localiser half full scale deflection (within 1.25º left/right) and the glide slope fly-up indicion does not exceed half full scale (maximum 0.35º fly-up), the approach may be continued until the Decision Height (DH). If at any point during the approach the localiser needle or glide slope fly-up indication exceeds half full scale deflection then the aircraft must execute the published missed approach procedure.",

There are several forms of MLS. But Time Reference Scanning Beam (TRSB) is the one MLS technique which accomplishes this best. TRSB works this way: A narrow microwave beam generated by the azimuth antenna scans rapidly “TO” and “FRO”, through the entire coverage volume. Another beam, generated by the elevation antenna, scans down and then up. When an aircraft enters this broad coverage volume, its receiver detects two pulses from each complete beam scan from each antenna in the system. In the elevation, for example, the first scan sweeps down. As it passes the aircraft, the pulse is received and a timer is started. When the scan returns, a second pulse is received and the timer is stopped. This is the key feature of TRSB. Instruments in the aircraft derive the airplane’s precise position from the time lapse between the two scan pulses of each beam. The aircraft position is updated right in the cockpit, several times per second. Because TRSB generates each of these scanning beams at precise times, MLS onboard receivers can distinguish between direct and reflected signals. If the azimuth beam begins its scan and is reflected by an obstacle, it will send a pulse out of time sequence and the aircraft receiver will reject it.",

It aimed to address the limitations of ILS and offer enhanced flexibility to its users. Microwave Landing System (MLS) features: Worldwide availability with 200 channels. Azimuth coverage of at least ±40° of the runway's on-course line (QDM) and allows selection of glide slopes ranging from 0.9° to 20°. Usable range extends up to 20-30 NM from the MLS site. The MLS incorporates a built-in Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). Includes a secondary system for back course transmissions, offering guidance within ±20° of the runway direction up to 15° in elevation, within a range of 10 NM and up to a height of 10,000 ft. Operates in the SHF band (5031 - 5090.7 MHz), allowing installation in hilly areas without the need for site leveling. The MLS scanning beam can be interrupted to avoid reflections, eliminating course deviation errors caused by aircraft, vehicles, and buildings. Increased azimuth and elevation coverage enables aircraft to choose their own approaches, improving runway utilization and benefiting helicopters and STOL aircraft. MLS is designed to be compatible with various navigation instruments and systems, including conventional localizer and glide path instruments, EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System), auto-pilot systems, and area navigation equipment. MLS provides positive automatic landing indications and clear on/off flag indications for the localizer and glide slope needles. The identification prefix for MLS consists of an 'M' followed by two letters. The goal is for all aircraft equipped with MLS to operate according to CAT III criteria. MLS operates in the SHF band (5031 - 5090.7 MHz). ILS operates in the VHF band (108-112 MHz), so MLS operates in a higher frequency band and the effect of ground reflections is reduced because the MLS scanning beam can be interrupted to avoid reflections.",

If we rotate the course selector knob the whole central CDI (course deviation indicator) display will rotate accordingly. This would also change the selected course for use with a VOR, similar to the OBS (Omni-Bearing Selector) on a fixed CDI display. However, it is important to note on this question that we can see a glideslope indication to the right of the HSI in figure 2B, meaning that this is tuned to an ILS frequency, and the CDI is locked on to localiser indications. The indications on the central CDI will not change (as it is tuned to ILS LOC) when it is turned. This is because the ILS localiser produces two lobes of differently modulated signal that the receiver interprets into a deviation from the centreline, this does not rely on the selected OBS course in any way. Pilots usually set the correct inbound course anyway as an aide memoir and to show the fly left/fly right indications the correct way round on the HSI. The course pointer will now be pointing to 232.5 degrees on the compass rose after rotating, 2.5 degrees clockwise from 230 degrees (which is also our heading), but will be indicating the same amount of \"dots\" off centreline, as this is unaffected by the selected course. This can be seen on the above annex, but you have to look carefully, as 2.5 degrees is a very small change. Notes for further learning: This feature of being able to swivel the CDI around makes flying back course approaches with HSI convenient. We can set the front course QDM and fly the back course approach as if it were a front course approach (without glideslope) Also note that, if we have OBS on the bottom left corner then the equipment will be a fixed CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). Rotating the OBS knob while tuned to ILS will only rotate the compass card but have no effect on the deviation display.",

The aircraft’s interrogator transmits a stream of pseudo-random omni-directional pulse pairs on the carrier frequency of the ground transponder. The ground transponder then receives these, waits for 50 microseconds, and repeats those pulse pairs outwards at a frequency 63 MHz above the interrogation frequency. The airborne system identifies its own unique stream of pulse pairs and measures the time of arrival electronically, between the start of the interrogation and the reception of the ground transponder's replies. Given the time delay (minus known times such as the 50 microseconds), the distance between the aircraft and the DME ground station can be quite precisely calculated. As there is only one interrogation frequency and one reply frequency for each DME ground station, they can only service a certain number of pulses per second, and it ends up meaning that the DME becomes saturated with around 100 aircraft using it, and it will then prioritise the pulses with the strongest signal. The aircraft that are closer to the ground station, and the ones with the stronger transmitting power will therefore be higher priority to be serviced by the DME ground station Aircraft attempting to search for a DME emit 150 pulses per second, but after 15000 pulses, reduce that to 60 pulses per second, and later on to 24 pulses per second when fully \"locked on\". As the DME can only handle 2700 pulses per second reliably, this ends up being approximately 100 aircraft, some searching, some locked on.",

Since the aerial elements will all be at slightly different distances from the source of the signal, each will detect a slightly different phase of that signal at the same instant. The value of these detected phase differences will be directly related to the direction of the incoming signal. The phase differences are used to drive the bearing indicator. On some VDF units a simple digital read out gives the bearing. A ground DF station can give true or magnetic bearings. It is common to use the so-called «Q-codes» to represent bearings. These codes originate from the old days when telegraphy was used for communication, where it was convenient to transmit short codes instead of full text messages. Therefore, the Q codes are not abbreviations. A number of codes were used, but in aviation, only a few exist today. Listed below are the codes that are relevant to direction finding.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.02.05.04.01: Explain that ILS approaches are divided into facility performance categories defined in ICAO Annex 10. ICAO annex 10 sets out facility performance categories in order to set out the requirements for CAT I, II and III approaches. There are therefore facility performance category I, II and III instrument landing systems. The differences between the three facility performance categories are numerous, everything from the accuracy down to the monitoring is defined for all three facility performance categories, with many more variables in between. In the end, that means that they can provide increasingly good guidance to aircraft as the category goes up, and the associated minima get lower. As you can see in the annex above, taken directly from ICAO annex 10, facility performance category I can give guidance down to a height of 100 ft or less, category II down to 50 ft or less and category III down to the runway (with the aid of ancillary equipment). It is important to note that the facility performance categories do not use the same altitudes at the ILS categories we use in normal operations. A facility performance category I ILS system is capable of providing information for a CAT I ILS as it gives useful information down to 100ft, which is lower than the lowest minimums of a CAT I ILS at 200ft. This gives some safety margin in the system, which is always useful at such extremely low heights.",

NDBs are non-directional beacons that transmit a simple carrier wave with a modulation to overlay the morse code identifier. They are a ground station consisting of just one aerial for transmission. The ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) is the equipment in the cockpit which measures the direction from which the NDB carrier wave signal came, and points a needle directly towards the NDB in question on one of the pilot's instruments. NDBs are split into two use categories, en-route (for long range navigation) and locator beacons (for terminal procedures). As specified in the LO above, locator beacons are low powered NDBs, and have short ranges of 10 - 25 nm. They are often used as beacons denoting the approach holding pattern, or the final approach fix. They may be co-located with a marker beacon (the outer marker usually), but NDBs are different from marker beacons, which people do occasionally get mixed up.",

Furthermore, in general, the closer aircraft will receive the stronger signal. At position C, the aircraft would receive the signal unaffected by ground clutter and terrain, resulting in the strongest signal. Coastal Refraction Coastal refraction is caused by radio waves travelling faster over sea than over land. This results in a change in the propagation direction when a wave crosses a boundary between sea and land. The refraction at the boundary of land and water is a function of the propagation speeds over land and water plus the incidence angle relative to the boundary. Radio waves speed up over water, causing the wave front to bend away from its normal path and pull it towards the coast. This phenomenon is negligible when the aircraft is perpendicular (90°) to the coast as the wave continues to propagate straight through the boundary. The magnitude of the refraction increases as the incidence increases. The effect of coastal refraction can be minimized by flying higher.",

The distance information can be used to determine the aircraft position or flying a track that is a constant distance from the station (this is referred to as a DME arc). There are several way to plot a route on a chart: straight route plotted between radio beacons direct route plotted without reference to any paricular radio beacons and fixes are calculated along the track based on position lines plotted from radio beacons In general a position line is a circle with radius the ground distance between the point and the ground station and centre at the ground station. Pay attention: there are some quite similar questions regarding DME poistion lines with very different answer. The main problem is about the DME distance: should a pilot consider DME distace plotted on a chart like a Slant or a Ground Range distance ? In general we can affirm that there is a difference between Ground Range and Slant Range but that difference is negligible and not worth considering until you are VERY close to the beacon, at which point plotting becomes quite immaterial and difficult owing to the relatively rapid changes in distance, i.e. 3 NM change in range is not significant when 150 NM from the beacon but it is significant when you are only 5 NM from the beacon. As a rule of thumb, discrepancies only start to appear within 1 NM per 1,000' of height, e.g. when flying at 10,000' the discrepancies only start to appear within 10 NM, at 20,000 within 20 NM, etc. Even then, they are very small and hardly worth worrying about, e.g. at 35,000' 35 NM Ground Distance = 35.6 NM DME Distance, and 10 NM Gnd Dist = 12 NM DME Dist",

The different display modes of the ND are the following: EXPANDED, MAP, or ARC mode: an expanded view of the compass rose, with the current heading at the top (“heading-up orientation”) VOR, FULL VOR, or ROSE VOR mode: the entire compass rose in a heading-up orientation APP or ROSE ILS mode: the entire compass rose in heading-up orientation, with only the ILS localiser visible, an additional glide slope indication appears to the right PLAN mode: the upcoming flight plan waypoints are depicted in a “north-up” orientation, the display range can be adjusted. The MAP (or ARC) mode of the ND usually displays information such as the selected and current track (or heading), the TAS and GS, the wind direction and speed, next waypoint distance, and weather radar information. Some questions will ask you to determine the mode selected on a given ND. To do so you need to ask yourself two questions: Is it a Full-Rose (360° compass rose displayed) or an Expanded Mode (90° of the compass rose displayed with ±45° either side of the centerline)? As you can see, this information is not very relevant for this specific question as all the provided figures of ND are expanded modes. Is it a VOR/ILS mode or a NAV mode? The VOR/ILS mode will simply have the VOR or ILS transmitter frequency, course, and deviation scales displayed on the top right-hand corner of the ND, whereas the NAV mode will only display the TO waypoint, the distance, and the time to that waypoint. You’re looking for a VOR/ILS mode, where the frequency of the VOR is indicated at the bottom. Figure 1 and 6 indicate is a full VOR and a full ILS mode respectively, on figure 2 you can see the plan mode with a large part of the route displayed and the True North indication at the bottom, figure 3 has no navaid tuned (no identifier displayed = MAP), and finally Figure 5 indicates ‘ILS’ at the bottom. Figure 4, however, has the VOR indication at the bottom left-hand corner and its frequency on the right. A course deviation scale is also displayed and further confirms that ND is a VOR mode display.",

In this question, our aircraft is crossing the 330 radial, and the slant distance is increasing a small amount, but by much less than our groundspeed, therefore, the groundspeed read-out on our DME will be lower than our actual groundspeed.",

The range of a VHF D/F signal is therefore the same as any line-of-sight signal, which can only travel as far as a straight line on a curved globe, plus a very small addition for curvature due to atmospheric refraction. Thus, the curvature of Earth causes much of the surface to be in shadow. Therefore, higher flying aircraft are more likely to be detected because they are above that shadow.

This indication is shown directly on the display. The OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) which is used for VOR radial tracking does not have an impact on the displayed ILS readings. Using an omni-bearing indicator (OBI) display will always give a simple, fly left or fly right, localiser display no matter the chosen OBS course. A Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) has a simple Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) in the middle of the slaved gyro compass, which can be turned to face any direction, on the gyro compass, but when receiving ILS signals will only produce exactly the same display as the standard OBI, fly left or fly right. The direction of the CDI does not affect the CDI indications, just how we view them. When using a ILS back-course, the usual signal lobes are reversed, so an OBI display will be absolutely reverse sensing. This is the same for the CDI in the centre of the HSI, reverse sensing indications. However, the CDI in the middle of the HSI can be turned to face the front course of the standard ILS (needle pointing downwards when flying the back-course) which reverses our view of the indications again. This gives correctly sensing localiser indications for the HSI during a back-course approach, only if the CDI is set to the course of the standard inbound ILS.",

An easy way to remember this is that V is for Variation and V is for VOR.

At this point, it is important to remember that the RMIs simply point their needle at the beacon, so the tail of the RMI needle is the radial we are on (the head of the needle is the QDM - the opposite direction to the radial). Therefore, we just need to pick the RMI with a heading of 010º (which they all have) and the tail of the needle between 250º and 330º, which is Figure B. Variation is not a factor as the HSI, RMI and VOR radials are all in magnetic. ALTERNATIVE METHOD When you're more comfortable with the differences between CDIs, RMIs and HSIs, you can begin to take shortcuts, which are very useful when flying using these instruments. The alternative method (for use on HSIs only), is that the deviation indication + the arrow always point towards the VOR. We can then work out which quadrant the VOR is in. For instance, in this example, the VOR must be somewhere between 060º (the \"TO\" arrow) and 150º (the direction of the deviation bar). The head of the needle (on the RMIs) points directly at the VOR, so we just need to choose the RMI whose needle points between 060º and 150º, which is figure B.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 062.02.05.04.08: Explain that multipath interference is caused by reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area. This question is not completely answerable from the question text alone, and the possible answers have to be considered to work out which one is correct. Therefore it is better to go through each and explain why it is correct/incorrect. A) \"The aircraft is heading in the opposite direction to the localiser thus the indications are reversed and change frequently.\" The fact that the aircraft is probably heading around the opposite direction to the localiser on downwind does not mean that it would show erratic readings and intermittent flags. If flying outbound along the localiser track, it would reverse sense, but this is the only truth to this statement. B) \"Lack of reception of the modulation signals due to a failure of the ground transmitters, so the aircraft receiver fails to lock onto the incoming signals.\" There is no known failure in the question, and this would remove the stable ident that is heard in the cockpit. C) \"Reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area leading to multipath signals outside the coverage area.\" Now this one is possible. The signals that are being transmitted by the ILS localiser and glide path are just radio waves like any other, therefore they bounce off obstacles and can cause rather wild, erratic readings outside the coverage area. They can even cause wobbly readings within the coverage area. Therefore, this answer is correct. D) \"The ILS shows incorrect indications unless the aircraft is established on inbound course and on the glideslope, so such indications are normal during radar vectoring.\" This option is far too specific. An ILS is still useful when more than half scale deflection left or right of the localiser, and when slightly above or below the glideslope, not only when fully established. In fact, there is a large and well published coverage area for LOC signals and for GP signals. It is correct that erratic indications are normal during radar vectoring, but not for this reason. Another potential cause that comes to mind is that the aircraft is flying through \"fake localiser\" side lobes, which are reverse sensing beams just outside of the coverage area, but these are usually a little more smooth than what is being asked in the question, and it is not one of the options in this question.",

These false glide slopes are actually side lobes. The presence of false glide slopes is attributed to various factors, including the presence of metallic structures near the transmitter and ground reflections, as well as the characteristics of the transmitting antenna. Pilots should remain mindful of their existence. The first false glide slope typically occurs at an altitude approximately double the glide path angle, which is around 6 degrees for a standard 3-degree glide path. In regular flight procedures, pilots typically align with the localizer and intercept the glide slope from below. This ensures avoidance of intercepting false glide slopes. An indication of a false glidepath could be seen in the rate of descent or when cross-checking the altitude. If the rate of descent required is higher than stated in the charts, for example 1500 fpm instead of 500 fpm, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath. If the altitude passing at the specific DME distance is not the altitude described in the charts, for example 3 000 ft at 4.5 DME instead of 1 500 ft, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath. There is no warning flag appearing on the CDI, and that is the reason why many incidents have happened when aircraft intercepted false glide paths and pilots did not realize. CDI WARNING FLAG Regarding the Warning Flag, it appears under the following circumstances: Equipment failure on the aircraft's receiver. Ground station failure. Indicator malfunction.

            "explanation": "The deflection of the needle is proportional to the course deviation, but sensitivity and deflection vary depending on the system being used: When used with a VOR or VORTAC, the instrument can be referred to as an \"omni bearing indicator\" (\"OBI\"). The courseline is selected by turning an \"omni bearing selector\" or \"OBS\" knob usually located in the lower left of the indicator. It then shows the number of degrees deviation between the aircraft's current position and the \"radial\" line emanating from the signal source at the given bearing. This can be used to find and follow the desired radial. Deflection is 10° deviation at full scale (each side), with each dot on the CDI representing 2°. When used with a GPS, or other RNAV equipment, it shows actual distance left or right of the programmed courseline. Sensitivity is usually programmable or automatically switched, but 5 nautical miles (9.3 km) deviation at full scale is typical for en route operations. Approach and terminal operations have a higher sensitivity up to frequently 0.3 nautical miles (0.56 km) at full scale. In this mode, the OBS knob may or may not have an effect, depending on configuration. When used for instrument approaches using a LDA or ILS the OBS knob has no function because the courseline is usually the runway heading, and is determined by the ground transmitter. A CDI might incorporate a horizontal needle to provide vertical guidance when used with a precision ILS approach where the glideslope is broadcast by another transmitter located on the ground. Summary: when CDI is use with: VOR 2° per dot. Full scale deflection 10° ILS localiser 0.5° per dot. Full scale deflection 2.5° ILS glidepath 0.14° per dot. Full scale deflection 0.7°",

Note 1: Any attempt to use the localiser outside the areas listed above may lead to false/reverse sense indications. Use outside designated coverage areas is therefore not permitted. Glidepath Coverage Vertical coverage from 0.45 θ to 1.75 θ above the horizontal through the ILS threshold (θ = glide path angle). This equates to 1.35° to 5.25° above the threshold horizontal for a nominal 3° glide path. Horizontal coverage extending in azimuth 8° either side of the extended centerline out to a range of 10 NM. The protection range and height of ILS is 25 NM / 6 250 ft. Note 2: Example of the glideslope vertical coverage calculation. For a glideslope of 3.3° the vertical coverage is as follows: 0.45 × 3.3° = approx. 1.49° (lower edge) 1.75 × 3.3° = approx. 5.77° (upper edge)",

These travel in straight lines, and will not go through solid objects such as buildings, mountains, the ocean, etc. This question mentions gaining the aerodrome weather from the VOR, which is possible as many airfield VORs have the ATIS readout on the VOR audio frequency. We call these signals \"line-of-sight\", as, if the antennas can \"see\" each other, they can transmit between each other. Of course, that depends on the power of the transmission, as higher power transmitters allow for a greater range. With the Earth being curved, this does pose a problem for long range transmissions between aircraft and ground stations, as the aircraft may not be within line of sight of the ground station. The ways to fix this are to get closer or go higher. The higher the aircraft gets, the further it can \"see\", so that means it can communicate with radio stations further away. The formula for the expected range of a transmission (Earth curvature limited) is: Distance (nm) = 1.23 x sqrt( height of transmitter (ft) ) + 1.23 x sqrt( height of receiver (ft) ) If either the transmitter or receiver is at sea level (0 ft), then you can cut out one term from the equation, making it: Distance (nm) = 1.23 x sqrt( height (ft) ) In this case, we are at FL 100 (10 000 ft), so our maximum range is; 1.23 x sqrt(10 000) = 1.23 x 100 = 123 nm (closest answer 125 nm)",

The magnitude and impact of these effects is dependent upon many factors including aircraft type, position, speed, geometry, equipment, size and speed of the violating object. Aircraft systems may absorb short time ILS signal fluctuations through the effects of filtering by on-board equipment and the dynamics of the airframe. Slow or bias type errors that are not detected by the anomaly detection algorithms result in indications to the pilot either through flags, aircraft control actions (from autopilot) or fluctuations of the cockpit display indicators. The length and magnitude of fluctuations are linked to the speed and time of the critical and / or sensitive area violation.

The head of the needle indicates the QDM, and the tail indicates QDR for the tuned NDB on a compass card/rose fed with magnetic heading. The nail shaped symbol on the compass rose represents the head or tail of the needle. We can see the blue nail between 230 and 235 degrees on the compass rose, with the sharp end pointing downward – which means it is the tail of the needle. The reading will be 232.5 degrees. (Midpoint between 230 and 235). Now if we look at the bottom left corner it was written “ADF 1 KUS” in blue, and that means the blue nail is associated with that NDB (1 means radio aid number 1). Combining all the information above we can deduce that the QDR for KUS NDB is 232.5 degrees. The nearest choice will be 232 degrees. Notes for further learning: The green nail at 170 degrees represent the second radio aid tuned for display. It has the sharp end pointing upward which means it is the head of the needle. Normally we should see some words on the bottom right corner like “ADF 2 NH” for example (in green colour). Somehow it was not shown in this annex. The aircraft is now tracking TO a VOR, as indicated by the solid white triangle (TO symbol pointing upward) ahead of the hollow white triangle (the symbol representing the aircraft). The identification of the VOR we are tracking to usually appears on the top right corner, but not in this case somehow. “NAV” on the top right corner most probably means we are in navigation mode, tracking on course 197 degrees (solid magenta line), on 017 radial of the VOR while almost centred and at 8.3NM from it. White solid line at 194 degrees is our current track with range markers on it.",

It aimed to address the limitations of ILS and offer enhanced flexibility to its users. Microwave Landing System (MLS) features: Worldwide availability with 200 channels. Azimuth coverage of at least ±40° of the runway's on-course line (QDM) and allows selection of glide slopes ranging from 0.9° to 20°. Usable range extends up to 20-30 NM from the MLS site. The MLS incorporates a built-in Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). Includes a secondary system for back course transmissions, offering guidance within ±20° of the runway direction up to 15° in elevation, within a range of 10 NM and up to a height of 10,000 ft. Operates in the SHF band (5031 - 5090.7 MHz), allowing installation in hilly areas without the need for site leveling. The MLS scanning beam can be interrupted to avoid reflections, eliminating course deviation errors caused by aircraft, vehicles, and buildings. Increased azimuth and elevation coverage enables aircraft to choose their own approaches, improving runway utilization and benefiting helicopters and STOL aircraft. MLS is designed to be compatible with various navigation instruments and systems, including conventional localizer and glide path instruments, EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System), auto-pilot systems, and area navigation equipment. MLS provides positive automatic landing indications and clear on/off flag indications for the localizer and glide slope needles. The identification prefix for MLS consists of an 'M' followed by two letters. The goal is for all aircraft equipped with MLS to operate according to CAT III criteria.",

Then draw the aircraft on radial 055°, probably it is easiest to draw it pointing in a similar direction of the HSI course as the heading is not given, as this is the most easily understood scenario. Now we can see that the aircraft is very close to the 060 radial, which we called the \"060° FROM\" course, and this is what our HSI will guide us to follow. As you can see in the annex above, or in your drawing, to follow the 060° course outbound from the VOR (the 060 radial), the aircraft is left of the course (as long as it is pointing in the correct direction). This will therefore provide a FROM arrow and a fly-right indication. We have set the heading as 020° in our depiction, but this makes no difference to the indication shown on the CDI in the middle of the HSI, which is what we must assume the examiner is asking about, it just makes things less cluttered. This particular depiction could perhaps occur if you were trying to intercept the 060 radial outbound (from original heading 020°) but overshot it.",

MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range measurement. MLS has the ability to interrupt the transmitted signal to avoid reflection by stationary objects (such as obstructions in the appropach path) which makes the system less sensitive to geographic location and obstacles. This and the relatively low cost of the system are its main advantages. Subsidiary advantages are the ability of MLS equipped aircraft to fly approach paths other than straight in and the single frequency used avoiding the requirement for frequency pairing.",

The critical area is protected because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal-in-space; b) the ILS sensitive area is an area where the parking and/or movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.

And one lobe at 150 Hz which indicates that the aircraft is below the glidepath. The centre is typically set to a 3° glidepath. Despite the accuracy of the system, there can be some sidelobes created. These sidelobes are not as powerful as the main ones but can provide multiple false glideslopes above the main lobe. False glideslopes will never be encountered when approaching the glidepath from below. An indication of a false glidepath could be seen in the rate of descent. If the rate of descent required is higher than stated in the charts, for example 1500 fpm instead of 500 fpm, the aircraft will be on a false glidepath.

            "explanation": "ADF Accuracy and Errors ICAO requirement is an accuracy of ±6° with a signal-to-noise ratio no less than 3:1. The ADF is subject to a number of potential errors: Static All forms of static can affect accuracy of the ADF. In snow and freezing rain precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. In conditions like this and where heavy static is present VHF aids should be used in preference to ADF. Night Effect The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk. Station Interference The long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that occasionally signals from stations on similar frequencies overlap. This will not cause errors in the daytime if the stations are only used within the protected range. At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range producing the same problems as night effect. Coastal Refraction Speed of a surface wave is affected by the surface over which it travels (faster over water than land). This change of speed means the wave is refracted at low altitude as it passes over a coastline. Refraction is always towards the coast. An aircraft receiving a refracted wave would give a false indication of the beacon's position. It will place the aircraft nearer to the coast than it actually is. This effect is worse the further back from the coast the beacon is sited. Quadrantal Error The wave front from the NDB can be distorted by the aircraft's structure as it approaches the aerial (“signal bending by the aircraft metallic surafaces”) The error is called \"quadrantal error\" because the effect is worst for signals arriving from 45° and 135° left and right of the nose, the four \"quadrants\". Quadrantal error is small and predictable. It can be compensated during the installation of the receiver aerial and any residual errors can be shown on a quadrantal error card kept near the instrument. Modern receivers completely remove it. Dip Dip occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial. Dip gives large bearing errors, only occurs in a turn and is at its greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45° and 135° left and right of the nose. Mountain Effect At low altitude multipath signals reflected from terrain can cause erroneous readings This effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave",

When the pilot of a DME-equipped aircraft tunes the frequency of a VOR (or ILS) with DME, the frequency of the co-located DME is automatically tuned. The aircraft interrogates the DME ground station with a pulsed signal, and the station replies. Aircraft equipment measures the time between transmission and reception to determine the distance; from that, groundspeed and time to station can be derived. Associated beacons are beacons with the same ident transmitted at different tones. For VORs and DMEs to be associated they must be less than 100ft (30m) apart if used as a terminal aid. If used for any other purpose they must be less than 2000ft (600m) apart. Associated TACANs and VORs are called VORTACs. When beacons are associated the three letter Morse ident is sent every seven and a half seconds. One comes from the DME, the next three from the VOR. The pitch of the DME ident is often higher than the VOR ident. If beacons fail to meet these criteria they may be given similar idents. A DME within 6NM of an en-route VOR might have the last letter of its ident changed to Z. e.g. the VOR ident might be LIP and the DME LIZ.",

            "explanation": "A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) is a ground-based, low frequency radio transmitter used as an instrument approach for airports and offshore platforms. The NDB transmits an omni-directional signal that is received by the ADF or Automatic Direction Finder, a standard instrument onboard aircraft. The pilot uses the ADF to determine the direction to the NDB relative to the aircraft. NDB's can be used to provide a non-precision approach to an airport. A pilot can make sure to be aligned with the correct approach path by maintaining the same QDM with the ADF, and can manage vertical guidance using their altimeter, with a minimum descent height/altitude. In terms of lateral errors permitted, flying an NDB approach, you must maintain a QDM/QDR that is ± 5° of the designated approach path. This is also the range in which an aircraft can be considered \"established\" on the approach. As the process of flying NDB approaches varies, depending on the cockpit hardware, this question could potentially cause some confusion, let's look at each option: \"The relative bearing must be less than 5º.\" This is incorrect, as the relative bearing (direction of the ADF pointer relative to the aircraft heading) will vary due to the wind correction angle. An aircraft could be perfectly flying an inbound course of 270º but with a 10º right wind correction, so heading 280º, the relative bearing would be 350º (10º left of the nose), but the aircraft would be established. \"The bearing pointer must be within 5º of the required course.\" This is true, as the bearing pointer indicates the QDM (when using an RMI or converting a fixed card ADF) and that must be within 5º of the correct inbound course for the approach. As long as that criteria is satisfied, the aircraft is considered established. The wording could be better to include all versions of aircraft hardware, but this is correct in essence, and far more correct than the other options. \"The wind correction angle must be less than 5º.\" The wind correction angle does not matter, as long as the aircraft is within 5º of the required QDM, it is established. \"variation due to reflections from terrain may NOT exceed 5º.\" Variations due to terrain reflections can affect NDB signals, but should not do so too much on NDB approaches, as this should be flight tested, etc. Nonetheless, NDB approaches have terrible accuracy and many errors, hence the high minimums. As we cannot determine the errors at any one time, we can only use the instrument readout that we have, so a high error does not mean that we are not established.",

            "explanation": "The modulation type of all ILS transmitters is the good old amplitude modulation (AM). The carrier oscillation in the localizer frequency range is 108.00 MHz to 111.975 MHz modulated with a 90Hz and a 150Hz tone signal. The ILS works by sending 2 beams up from the landing runway, one telling the pilots if they or high or low and the other telling them if they are left or right of the runway centreline. The ILS receiver on the aircraft measures the difference in depth of modulation (DDPM) between the signals For most ILS’s the pilots should be lined up with the runway centreline and on a 3 degree glide path, but on some ILS’s, like London City have a steeper approach of 5.5 degrees. The vertical beams of modulated signals are produced from a horizontally polarized antenna complex beyond the far end of the approach runway. They create an expanding field that is 21⁄2° wide (about 1,500 feet) 5 miles from the runway. The field tapers to runway width near the landing threshold. The left side of the approach area is filled with a VHF carrier wave modulated with a 90 Hz signal. The right side of the approach contains a 150 Hz modulated signal. The aircraft’s VOR receiver is tuned to the localizer VHF frequency ( is the same for both beams, only the modulation of te carrier wave changes !) that can be found on published approach plates and aeronautical charts. The circuitry specific to standard VOR reception is inactive while the receiver uses localizer circuitry and components common to both. The signals received are passed through filters and rectified into DC to drive the course deviation indicator. If the aircraft receives a 150 Hz signal, the CDI of the VOR/ILS display deflects to the left. This indicates that the runway is to the left. The pilot must correct course with a turn to the left. This centers course deviation indicator on the display and centers the aircraft with the centerline of the runway. If the 90 Hz signal is received by the VOR receiver, the CDI deflects to the right. The pilot must turn toward the right to center the CDI and the aircraft with the runway center line. (annex1)",

            "explanation": "All ILS Marker beacons operate on 75 MHz VHF (thus no frequency selections are necessary for the pilot) and radiate a fan shaped field pattern giving to the pilot an indication of range from the touchdown zone whilst on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations used to be equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead each marker. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker (OM) is located approximately 4-5 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach, and is used for identifying glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The light flashes blue. The Middle Marker (MM) is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1 NM away from the touchdown zone. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. It usually identifies decision height for standard CAT I ILS systems. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The light is amber. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker (IM) is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located on or just before the runway threshold, particularly useful for CAT II ILS, as it gives the decision height for that approach. The light is white. Tip: A good way to remember the colour of the flashing lights is with the acronym BAW - Blue Amber White - which is the airline code for British Airways. Given the diagram shown, we just need to be able to match the amber light to being the middle marker, and then read out the DME distance when at the middle marker, which is 1.0 nm (D1.0).",

Annoyingly, there are currently no known MLS approaches in use around the world. Nonetheless, it can still be answered without too much difficulty. Microwave Landing Systems (MLS) are an improved method of guiding aircraft on approach to the runway, similar in accuracy to ILS, but with the capability for aircraft to fly segmented and curved approaches (if properly equipped), as well as reducing any multipath interference by blocking out signal areas. They were tested in the late 20th and early 21st century, but were far more expensive and only slightly more useful than the up-and-coming GNSS systems (now LPV approaches, GBAS, etc.), so never became widely used. To program them into the aircraft requires the channel number, angle of azimuth offset (relative to the extended centreline) and angle of glide path, as in the figure above. More complex systems can input the segmented and curved approaches. To address the other options, ATC do not give approach courses for instrument approaches, those are charted. The approach profile in the FMS could be a possible answer for the more complex approaches, but given that 3 is not correct, and 2 is correct, it must be 2 and 4. Note: the feedback on this question is not perfect, but has been followed as precisely as possible, so any further exam feedback would be appreciated. It can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.",

The purpose of the markers is to provide range information while on the approach. They transmit an almost vertical beam. Almost all installations are equipped with an outer marker and a middle marker. Category 2 or 3 ILS may be equipped with an inner marker as well. Audio- and visual signals in the cockpit will indicate when the aircraft is passing overhead. In many installations, marker beacons are being replaced or supplemented by the use of a DME associated with the ILS. The Outer Marker is located approximately 3.9 nautical miles from the runway threshold and is aligned across the front beam of the localiser. Its purpose is to provide height, distance and equipment functioning checks to aircraft on final approach. It is modulated at 400-hertz and keyed to transmit dashes (“- - - - - ”) continuously at a rate of 2 per second. The Middle Marker is aligned across the front beam of the localiser and is situated approximately 1050 metres from the runway threshold. Its purpose is to indicate the imminence, in low visibility conditions, of visual approach guidance. This marker is modulated at 1300-hertz and keyed to transmit alternate dots and dashes (“· - · - · - ”). The rate is 2 dashes and 6 dots per second. An aircraft on the glide slope over the middle marker should be roughly 200 feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The Inner Marker is modulated at 3000-hertz, identified by a keyed continuous signal of 6 dots per second (“· · · · ·”) and is located 75–450 metres from the runway threshold. Summary: Outer Marker: Identifies glideslope intercept or the Final Approach Fix (light flashes blue) Middle Marker: Identifies decision height (light flashes amber) Inner Marker: Identifies decision height for a CAT II ILS (light flashes white )",

Because NDBs produce LF and MF radio waves, which travel primarily as surface (ground) waves for the purposes of directional navigation (as is required for NDBs), the ground that is being travelled over matters a lot. Water is flat, for instance, so surface waves travel over water faster and much further than a similar strength wave travelling over rolling hills, built up areas, and worst, mountainous terrain. Basically, the more obstacles and rougher the terrain, the worse the NDB signals travel. This is most prominent in mountainous terrain as the radio waves try and follow the contours of the ground, which means going over the peaks and into the valleys. The largest problem with this is a phenomenon known as diffraction, where the wave gets scattered slightly as it crests each mountain and tries to go down the other side. Reflection of the waves also could be an issue, but does not affect NDB directions received by aircraft as much as the relative diffraction of mountains.",

                "The lobe on the right- hand side has a 150 Hz tone"
            ],
            "explanation": "The localizer aerial transmits two lobes. The lobe on the left-hand side of the approach has a 90 Hz tone. The lobe on the right- hand side has a 150 Hz tone. An aircraft located to the left of the centerline receives more of the 90 Hz modulation and relatively less of the 150 Hz modulation. This difference between 90 Hz and 150 Hz received is called DDM (Difference in Depth of Modulation). When the aircraft receives more of the 90 Hz modulation (aircraft is located left of the centerline), CDI needle is deflected to the right. When the aircraft receives more of the 150 Hz modulation (aircraft is located right of the centerline), CDI needle is deflected to the left. When DDM is zero, the needle will be in the centre (aircraft on the centerline). The localiser of an ILS approach can produce a secondary \"back beam\", which goes exactly the opposite direction to the original localiser. This back-beam may be used during the missed approach guidance. Sometimes it is also used for non-precision approaches without vertical guidance on the opposite runway. Using the back-beam course will cause reverse sensing in localiser indications. An aircraft approaching from the opposite direction will have 90 Hz modulation on its right side and 150 Hz modulation on its left side, which is opposite than normal. This means that if the pilot selects the final course of the runway corresponding to the \"back beam\" approach, he will receive opposite CDI indications. The aircraft will receive more of 90 Hz modulation when it is on the right side, but needle will be deflected to the right ('fly-right' instead of 'fly-left'). The opposite will happen when the aircraft is to the left of the centerline (needle will be deflected to the left) In order to avoid reversed indications, the course of the \"front beam\" approach direction can be selected. For the specific example, the 'front beam' course is 136° and the 'back beam' course is 316°. While approaching runway 32, selecting CDI course 136° will provide normal deviations to the pilots, while selecting CDI course 316° will provide reversed indications. Left drift means that the aircraft is displaced left of the centerline. With the selected course of 316°, a full left deflection will be shown. Note: The option \"HSI showing a heading of 300°, with the selected course of 136° and a full right deflection.\" seems to be correct as well, but since we are flying towards the runway 32, selecting a course of 316° (approach runway course) is what the approach charts suggest (refer to the approach chart figure).",

The principal propagation method of NDBs is the ground wave. However, it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the ionosphere is less dense and attenuation is least. Returning sky waves take a longer propagation path than ground waves so they are often out of phase. Night effect can be detected by listening for Fading on the carrier wave (BFO on) and by the instrument hunting. It is most likely at dawn or dusk.",

We can be sure that the aircraft is within the coverage area in this question, as it is fully established on the ILS approach (at 4 NM it is most likely to be descending on the glide path as well as on the localiser). This leaves only one answer available, as none of the other options happens when within the correct coverage area of the ILS. Reflections of the ILS signals off objects can hit the aircraft at certain stages of the approach, altering the difference in depth of modulation between the 90 Hz and the 150 Hz lobes, and can cause a false movement of the ILS needles, which in turn can affect the autopilot if one is engaged.",

            "explanation": "Reference signal is a continuous wave, omni-directional signal that is frequency-modulated (FM). Regardless of aircraft position relative to the VOR, at a given range and any instant the phase of the reference signal is always the same. Variable signal is an uniformly-rotated signal at 30 revolutions per second that emits a directional signal. The relationship between the phase of two signals varies according to the position of the receiver around the VOR transmitter. This question can be solved using the following example: Imagine that you drop a stone into the water and concentric circular waves arise. This will be our Reference signal. Now, there are two ducks on the water at different places, but with the same distance from the centre. When the wave arrives, both ducks will move up and down at the same time. Consequently, if both aircraft are on the same DME distance around the VOR, they will have an equal Reference Signal, at the same time. On the other hand, if the ducks swim behind each other (on the same radial), they will move up and down at a different time. We can, therefore, conclude that for aircrafts on the same radial, the Reference Signal is unequal, at the same time. The Variable Signal works differently. Because of the moving antenna, the wave starts on every degree of rotation with another phase value. Therefore, if the aircraft are on the same distance, but on different radials, they will have unequal Variable Signal. If they are on the same radial (at different distances), we will witness the same phenomenon with the ducks behind each other - if the first duck gets the crest, the other will get the trough. Resulting in an unequal phase. Summary: For this type of question, the Varianle Signal is always unequal. Same Distance = Equal Reference Signal but unequal Variable Signal. Same Radial = Both signals are unequal.",
