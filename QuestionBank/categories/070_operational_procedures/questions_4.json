            "explanation": "ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 4. Holdover Time (HOT) 4.7. The HOT begins with the start of the de-icing/anti-icing application in the case of a one-step operation, or the beginning of anti-icing in a two-step process and ends after an elapsed time equal to the appropriate HOT. A pilot must monitor the time elapsed from the start of the HOT identified and ensure that taxi and take-off are achieved before the HOT elapses. If not, additional de-icing/anti-icing will be required. CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines. In this case, the fact that snow has started to accumulate on the windshield may indicate that the HOT has probably expired due to the jet blast from the preceeding Boeing 747, which reduces HOT. Therefore, the take-off cannot be performed within the time of effectiveness of the first application anda second application is necessary. Note that it is important that the aircraft is not only re-coated with the protective fluid (anti-ice) but also washed properly (de-iced) => the original anti-ice might have been diluted and frozen to the aircraft's surface.",

Note: This question is not very realistic, but you just have to look past the ridiculousness and give the examiner what they want to hear, and remember that they are testing your knowledge of a very specific learning objective. WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Pilots should be particularly alert in calm wind or light winds of 3 to 7 knots conditions and where the vortices could stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. Calm wind conditions are most dangerous as wake turbulence stagnates on the runway and is not blown to one side. Runway 25R: Wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft or adjacent runway 25C could blow back onto the runway. Runway 25C: Due to the calm wind conditions, vortices from the preceding aircraft will stagnate in the area of the runway. They might move outwards slowly, but this is still quite a dangerous situation to have. Runway 25L: The wind is coming from ahead and from the right (westerly at 3 kt). The wake turbulence will be blown along the runway and the right hand vortices will get blown onto the runway. Runway 18: the wind is blowing with a fairly high speed from the right, so the wake turbulence is most likely to clear.",

There are three aspects of your windshear escape: power, pitch and configuration. Your objective is to extract maximum power from the engine and maximum lift from the wings. (1) Power. Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch upâ way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. Weâre flying at the edge of the stall because thatâs where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, itâs best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until youâre safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you canât afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. HYDROPLANING SPEED CALCULATIONS: Rotating Tyres formula (applies to rejected take-offs): V = 9 â P NON-Rotating Tyres formula (applies to touchdown): V = 7.7 â P Where V stands for velocity (kt) and P is tyre pressure (PSI) In this case, the aircraft is landing: V = 7.7 â 200 = approx. 109 kt => We must make sure that the reference landing speed (VREF) is below 109 kt. Referring to the provided table, the flap setting is FLAP 30.",

            "explanation": "There are two noise abatement departure procedures (NADP): NADP 1: for close in noise sensitive areas. The philosophy is to reduce the noise by reducing engine thrust settings but to maintain a steep climb to get away from the ground. This precludes retracting flaps / slats as this would need an acceleration, which would keep the aircraft lower for longer. No lower than 800 ft above ground level (AGL), reduce engine thrust Do not accelerate but continue to climb at V2 + 10 to 20 kts Continue climb to 3000 ft AGL, and now accelerate and retract the flaps / slats NADP 2: for distant noise sensitive areas. The philosophy here is to use the airspace before reaching the noise sensitive area, to accelerate and retract the flaps / slats and then climb at a high performance with a clean wing. Once the noise sensitive area is reached, the aircraft will be higher than with the technique of NADP 1. No lower than 800 ft AGL, accelerate and clean up the flaps / slats Once clean, climb at a suitable high performance climb speed In both NADP 1 and 2, the lowest level to initiate an action is 800ft AGL and the procedure effectively ends at 3000 ft AGL as the aircraft is now high enough. Looking at the answers: Initially climb WITHOUT accelerating or reducing thrust. At 1500 ft AGL reduces thrust. At or above 3000 ft AGL reduces the climb rate to accelerate and retract flaps/ slats. --> CORRECT. This answer matches NADP 1. Thrust (noise) is reduced with no acceleration. Although 1500 ft is higher than 800 ft, remember the regulation is that no action is taken below 800 ft, so 1500 ft is a valid answer. The procedure then ends at 3000 ft as the aircraft finally accelerates and retracts flaps / slats. Climb with maximum thrust and accelerate to retract flaps and slats as soon as possible. Continue the climb in a clean configuration. Maintain 250 KIAS below FL100. --> INCORRECT. NADP 1 does not allow for acceleration and clean up 'as soon as possible'. Initially climb with maximum thrust and WITHOUT accelerating. At or above 800 ft AGL reduce thrust and accelerate to retract the flaps/slats. --> INCORRECT. NADP 1 does not allow for acceleration and retraction of flaps/slats at 800 ft. This happens at 3000 ft. After lift-off immediately reduces thrust. Maintain V2+10 KIAS and at or above 3000 ft AGL reduce the climb rate to accelerate and retract flaps/slats. --> INCORRECT. 'After lift-off immediately.' is wrong. No actions below 800 ft allowed.",

The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires canât break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

Increasing the angle of attack is exactly the opposite from what the pilot should do - the AF447 pilot reacted by pitching up, which led to an aerodynamic stall. Furthermore, the question explicitly states that there is no way around it, which means that climbing is not a solution. \"Descend below clouds.\" Incorrect.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications â one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

The second procedure (NADP 2) provides noise reduction to areas more distant from the runway end. NADP 1 prioritises noise abatement for areas close to the airport, by keeping the take-off flap/slat setting the same until 3000ft, but doing a thrust reduction at or above 800ft (can be slightly above depending on operator/terrain). The aircraft only accelerates to remove flaps when 3000ft has been reached, as the act of accelerating the aircraft reduces the climb gradient, which makes the aircraft closer to the ground in a potentially noise sensitive zone. The initial climbing speed to the noise abatement initiation point shall not be less than V2 + 20 km/h (10 kt). On reaching an altitude at or above 240 m (800 ft) above aerodrome elevation, adjust and maintain power/thrust in accordance with the noise abatement power/thrust schedule provided in the aircraft operating manual. Maintain a climb speed of V2 + 20 to 40 km/h (10 to 20 kt) with flaps and slats in the take-off configuration. At no more than an altitude equivalent to 900 m (3 000 ft) above aerodrome elevation, while maintaining a positive rate of climb, accelerate and retract flaps/slats on schedule.

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplaneâs glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraftâs rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

When it shows a rate of climb: it means that the cabin altitude is increasing => at a higher altitude, pressure decreases. Therefore, the pressure inside the cabin is reducing. Consequently, the differential pressure (difference between cabin pressure and atmospheric pressure) decreases. Conversely, when it indicates a rate of descent: it means that the cabin altitude is decreasing => at a lower altitude, pressure increases. Therefore, the pressure inside the cabin is increasing. Consequently, the differential pressure increases.",

            "explanation": "Looking at the answers: 'Pre-event decompression training' --> INCORRECT. Prior training will assist the crew in handling the situation but will have no effect on the time of useful consciousness. 'Aircraft speed' --> INCORRECT. The aircraft's speed has no effect. The time of useful consciousness will be the same if you are flying at 100 kts or 400 kts. 'Altitude' --> CORRECT. The time of useful consciousness is based on altitude, as the air becomes thinner with altitude and less oxygen is available. 'The time of day' --> INCORRECT. The time of useful consciousness is unaffected by the time of day. Whether it is day or night, you will have the same amount of time depending on your vertical level. Time of Useful Consciousness (TUC) refers to the duration available to a pilot before experiencing hypoxia and being able to take corrective actions following a loss of sufficient oxygen supply, which can occur due to decompression. In simpler terms, TUC represents the period during which the pilot remains effectively conscious. Typically, it is considered the point when individuals can no longer assist themselves. TUC varies based on the altitude at which the pilot is flying and the pilot's health, such as the influence of smoking, which can lead to a shorter TUC. Moreover, engaging in increased physical activity during interrupted oxygen supply results in a greater demand for oxygen, further reducing the TUC. When a crew member is on board a pressurized aircraft that experiences cabin pressurization loss, as in the case of rapid decompression, TUC becomes a crucial consideration. Here is the relationship between Altitude and TUC for a person at rest, with the source being official Learning Objective 040 02 01 02 Respiratory and circulatory systems: At 20 000 ft, the TUC is approximately 30 minutes (or 5 minutes when the person is moderately active). At 25 000 ft, the TUC reduces to 2 - 3 minutes. At 30 000 ft, the TUC further decreases to 1 - 2 minutes. At 35 000 ft, the TUC becomes 30 - 90 seconds. At 40 000 ft, the TUC significantly diminishes to 15 - 20 seconds",

These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines.

On the lee side of the terrain, the aircraft could encounter very strong down drafts. It is certainly possible that the air is descending more quickly than the aircraft can climb. 'Risks of entering the area where the waves exist because the rate of climb may exceed what the aeroplane is capable of controlling' --> INCORRECT. Behind the lee of the mountain is an area of down drafts as the air sinks down with the terrain. Exceeding the rate of climb ability of the aircraft is exactly the opposite of the problem encountered.",

As you approach the microcurst, you will experience a headwind which results in a sudden increased airspeed. Consequently, lift increases and the aircraft \"ballons\". As decribed in the question text. As you fly through the microburst, the wind will change and the headwind decreases. As you fly immediately under it, strong downdrafts will be experienced which may be enough to force the aircraft into the ground or at least cause it to lose a significant amount of height. The next stage should be anticipated, as severe energy loss can be expected beyond the centre of the microburst. At this stage, the tailwind increases resulting in a sudden reduction of airspeeds which causes the lift to decrease. As a consequence, the aicraft will sink. If the windshear is too severe, a go-around should be immediately executed. When windshear is encountered, crew must assess whether safe flight parameters can be maintained or not. If yes, the approach may be continued. If not, a go-around must be initiated without delay. Flight parameters must be carefully monitored.",

High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning.

            "explanation": "DITCHING Ditching an aircraft into the sea, a river, or a lake, is a manoeuvre that, by definition, cannot be practiced and may be extremely hazardous. It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft. 3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending. 5. You encounter more turbulence as you enter the final vortex. If you haven't already hit the ground, you may begin to climb again as you exit the vortex.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications â one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

WINDSHEAR: Descent and approach When wind shear conditions are anticipated, the approach and landing should be delayed until conditions improve, or the aircraft should divert to a more suitable airport. Select the most favourable holding point, approach path and runway, considering the location of the likely wind shear condition, and the available runway approach aids. Select less than full flaps for landing (to maximize the climb gradient capability and provide a wider margin between stall and flap overspeed) and adjust the final approach speed accordingly. If an ILS is available, engage the autopilot for a more accurate approach tracking. Closely monitor the airspeed, speed trend and ground speed during the approach to detect any evidence of imminent wind shear. If the presence of wind shear is confirmed, be prepared for a possible missed approach and escape maneuver. If the aircraft passes through a windshear line from a tailwind to a headwind component, the inertia of the aircraft results initially in an increased airspeed and a deviation above the glidepath. The pilot's instinctive power reduction can result in the aircraft being short of power with a high rate of descent as the glidepath is approached and the effect of the inertia is lost. A rapid increase of power is now required if the aircraft is not to sink below the glidepath at a dangerously low altitude. The aircraft should be stabilised by a certain point on the approach, but that is up to the procedures followed, and being stabilised by 800ft is an arbitrary value, so is not correct.",

This goes against what is commonly believed (and taught). The reason for a fuel jettison system is not actually to get below MLM, as most people think, but instead is to get light enough to fulfil the requirements for minimum climb gradients (such as landing climb or OEI approach climb). If the aircraft can fulfill all these climb requirements at the MTOM (minus a short 15 minute flight), then it does not need a fuel jettison system at all (such as the B737 and A320 family). The reason is that an overweight landing is not a massive problem (the aircraft is checked afterwards but it is not likely to be a problem at the time), but the climb performance on a go-around needs to be acceptable to avoid terrain, as that is very important to avoid a disastrous accident.",

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

Secondly, would it be practical to type a message on CPDLC during this event. Most of us would say not, but there is an 'emer' selection on the CDPLC as This requires the press of just the relevant line select key to initiate. Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) using the FANS 1/A network has become the primary means of communicating with ATC in oceanic regions around the world and is also implemented in several domestic regions as well. One function of FANS CPDLC no crew ever wants to have to use is emergency reporting. During an emergency, the flight crew would normally revert to voice communications. However, the crew may use CPDLC for emergency communications if it is either more expedient or if voice contact cannot be established. When a MAYDAY or PAN message is sent via CPDLC, the ADS-C emergency mode is automatically activated. An ADS-C periodic report is automatically transmitted and tagged as âemergencyâ to highlight the situation to ATC. The emergency periodic reports continue to be transmitted until ADS Emergency is selected to OFF. ADS Emergency is located on the ATC LOGON STATUS page 2/2 (figure 3). ATC will respond with appropriate acknowledgements and clearances via CPDLC.",

Airframe icing can be a large problem for flight, and it forms in many different ways. In flight, airframe icing occurs due to supercooled water droplets hitting a cold airframe, or due to hoar frost, etc., but this means that it forms very differently to icing on the ground, which often forms due to rain falling on the cold airframe, slush, snow build-up, etc. These often look totally different, with in-flight icing building up on the leading edges of the wings, engines and aircraft nose, and with ground icing looking like snow on the wings, icicles hanging off the surfaces, slush in the wheel wells, etc. That is why we can't really say that one or the other is \"worst\", as both types of icing are so different.",

Follow the procedures in DOC 7030 3. Split levels to regain some separation. For example climb or descend by 500 ft if normal separation is 1000 ft. More details from: ICAO ANNEX 2 - Attachment B. Unlawful Interference General The following procedures are intended as guidance for use by aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the aircraft is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact. Procedures If the pilot-in-command cannot proceed to an aerodrome in accordance with the rules in chapter 3, 3.7.2., he/she should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until able to notify an ATS unit or until within radar or ADS-B coverage. When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible: a) Attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc., should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and b) Proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contigencies, where such procedures have been established and promulgated in DOC 7030 - Regional Supplementary Procedures; or c) If no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area by 300 m (1000 ft) if above FL290 or by 150 m (500 ft) if below FL290.",

Wake turbulence occurs due to the wingtip vortices formed by an aircraft, largest when heavy and flying slowly. The vortices are the effect of air travelling from the underside of the wing, around the wingtip, and onto the upper side of the wing. This means that the swirl direction is upwards at and outside the wingtips, but is downwards between the wingtips of an aircraft. This causes quite a significant downdraft, enough to make the vortices travel downwards generally, as shown in the second annex above. In the case of the trailing aircraft which is taking pictures, it would be represented by the first annex above (although much closer to the lead aircraft), as its right wing would be in the downdraft area behind the large aircraft wing, but its left wing would be in the updraft area outside of the wingtip, therefore it would want to roll to the right, potentially uncontrollably. It is important to note that this question is slightly ambiguous on the exact location of the trailing aircraft, but that for a large range of positions, this same right roll effect would occur. Most likely, severe turbulence would also be felt.",

We don't know which runway the preceding heavy aircraft is landing on, so simply landing on a different runway, applying proper separation or approaching on a higher glide path will have to wait for the real world. Regarding wake turbulence and wind conditions: Calm wind: wake vortices will persist for approximately 3 minutes and slowly roll outwards and apart. This is not desirable as the lack of wind means the vortices can remain on the runway for some time. Light crosswind: The downwind vortex will be blown off the runway. The upwind vortex, however, can be pushed back, remaining on the runway for longer than in calm winds. A light crosswind will not be strong enough to break up the vortices. Strong crosswind: A strong wind will break apart vortices. The crosswind component will additionally help to blow any vortices clear of the runway. More information on WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wingtips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced when the aircraft is Heavy Slow In a clean configuration",

This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Pilots should be particularly alert in calm wind or light winds of 3 to 7 knots conditions and where the vortices could stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. Calm wind conditions are most dangerous as wake turbulence stagnates on the runway and is not blown to one side. In a slow hover taxi or stationary hover near the surface, helicopter main rotor(s) generate downwash producing high velocity outwash vortices to a distance approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. When rotor downwash hits the surface, the resulting outwash vortices have behavioral characteristics similar to wing tip vortices produced by fixed wing aircraft. However, the vortex circulation is outward, upward, around, and away from the main rotor(s) in all directions. Pilots of small aircraft should avoid operating within three rotor diameters of any helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover. In forward flight, departing or landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind or crossing behind landing and departing helicopters.",

The airspeed increases and the aircraft floats up above the flight profile. Position 2 on the figure: The aircraft now flies under the wind shear / micro-burst. The previous headwind decreases and the airspeed decreases. The aircraft now sinks due to the loss of energy and also the down draft. The angle of attack will decrease as the relative airflow is now coming from a higher orientation.

Birds can damage engines, clog windshields, or create other dangerous conditions when they collide with an aircraft. Airports and aviation authorities deploy a variety of bird scare techniques to reduce the danger of bird strikes. Bird control at airports may be accomplished by using bird distress calls. Bird distress calls are imitations of a bird's distress call that are produced by recordings or electrical equipment. Other birds may hear these distress sounds as a warning and a threatening atmosphere, judging the place to be unsafe and deciding to fly away. It's crucial to remember that the exact bird species, surrounding circumstances, and frequency of use can all affect how effective bird distress calls are. If birds understand there is no serious threat nearby, they may grow accustomed to frequent distress calls.

The cabin altitude is closely controlled to simulate a lower altitude, typically around 6 000 to 8 000 feet. If there is a failure in the pressurization system, the cabin altitude may start to increase. As the cabin altitude rises, the air pressure inside the aircraft decreases, and this can lead to discomfort in the ears. A narrow passage called the eustachian tube regulates air pressure in your ear. When a plane climbs or descends, the air pressure changes quickly, and your eustachian tube often doesn't react quickly enough. This difference in pressure between the middle ear and the cabin can result in the sensation of an \"ear pop\". The discomfort and \"popping\" sensation in the ears are typically signs of the body adjusting to changes in pressure. \"If the oxygen pressure is also dropping, there could be an oxygen system failure.\" Incorrect. The oxygen pressure is not relevant. \"If the cabin pressure increases, it could be due to an entry door or cargo door opening.\" Incorrect.

It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplaneâs glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraftâs rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling âhotâ brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or âpoppingâ, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive (fast) decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 071.02.01.03.06: Explain the responsibilities of the commander with regard to MEL. Always read the question very carefully. The first sentence states ââ¦you found that your AUTOPILOT (singular) doesnât work, â¦â. This line implies that the particular aircraft in question is only fitted with one autopilot system, which happens to be currently unserviceable - I.e., we have no autopilot available to use in flight. I appreciate the B737 would normally have 2 autopilots fitted, and the ânumber installedâ field as â-â doesnât clarify the situation. However, when you see this blank/dashed field, it normally means the MEL is not MSN specific, and that the number installed can vary, dependent on that particular aircraftâs configuration (some 737s in the operatorâs fleet may have 2 autopilots installed, others in the fleet may only have one). The annex states 1 autopilot is required, but âmay be inoperative provided approach minimums do not require its useâ. This means, we cannot perform any approach that requires an autoland. Therefore, the lowest approach minima we can use is CAT I (200 ft AGL, 550 m visibility). You need to know that autoland is mandatory for LTS CAT I, CAT II, LTS CAT II, CAT IIIA and CAT IIIB. Therefore, without any autopilot, none of these approach types are possible, as they all require at least one operational autopilot (or 2 operational autopilots in the case of CAT IIIB). As a result, the correct answer is no, you cannot carry out a CAT II approach, because CAT II requires autoland, and therefore 1 autopilot. 2 autopilots are only required for CAT IIIB approaches. CAT II approaches cannot be flown manually. Note: MSN = manufacturer serial number LTS = lower than standard",

As of yet we do not have enough information to change this question or correct answer so please continue to provide as much feedback as possible and we may be able to align fully with the EASA exams, thank you. Learning Objective 071.02.11.01.03: Explain how flaps and slats may adversely affect fuel jettisoning. Fuel jettisoning is required to be a feature on any CS25 aircraft that could take off at its MTOW and in case of an emergency landing after only 15 minutes of flight, would not be safe to land at that weight (specifically it is in reference to the missed approach climb gradients). Therefore, those such aircraft are required to have a system to rapidly jettison fuel to lose enough weight to become safe for landing and a potential go-around. Jettisoning usually occurs from a valve at the rear of each wing (from the main fuel tanks), and therefore, the use of flaps/slats changes the airflow around this area, and might interfere with the fuel jettisoning, by reducing the flow rate due to pressure changes, turbulent/stalled airflow, etc. Therefore, the jettisoning of fuel with high lift devices extended must be checked in the aircraft's certification process, and a placard will be in place if jettisoning is restricted by the use of flaps/slats. (see below) CS 25.1001 Fuel jettisoning system (h) Unless it is shown that using any means (including flaps, slots and slats) for changing the airflow across or around the wings does not adversely affect fuel jettisoning, there must be a placard, adjacent to the jettisoning control, to warn flight-crew members against jettisoning fuel while the means that change the airflow are being used.",

In an emergency, not time should be lost by taxiing, therefore the aircraft should remain on the runway. The engines and APU should be cut and all aircraft systems switched off, to minimize the risks of fire. Evacuation checklists should then be performed, if time permits.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or âpoppingâ, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive (fast) decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. Air to escape violently and too fast from the lungs and other air-filled cavities in the body such as the sinuses and eustachian tubes, typically resulting in severe to fatal barotrauma. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

As a result, the pilot may receive error indications, which could include alerts about abnormal engine performance or potential limitations on power output. Source: ICAO Doc 9640 The Air Florida Flight 90 crash serves as a poignant example of human error leading to tragedy. Despite evident snowfall, the pilots overlooked icing conditions. They also failed to adequately remove ice buildup before takeoff, resulting in diminished lift and increased drag. Furthermore, despite sub-freezing temperatures and snowfall, the crew neglected to activate the engine anti-ice system. This system, utilizing engine heat, prevents sensor freezing, ensuring accurate readings. During the pre-takeoff checklist, a crucial conversation unfolded between the captain (CAM-1) and the first officer (CAM-2): CAM-2: Pitot heat? CAM-1: On. CAM-2: Engine anti-ice? CAM-1: Off. Despite the freezing conditions, the crew omitted to activate the engine anti-ice systems, leading to erroneous readings on the engine pressure ratio (EPR) thrust indicators. The correct power setting for the prevailing conditions at Washington National Airport was 2.04 EPR. However, analysis of cockpit voice recorder data revealed that the actual power output corresponded to a mere 1.70 EPR.",

Flying through the microburst: When the aircraft flies through the microburst, the wind conditions change. The headwind decreases, and strong downdrafts are experienced as the aircraft passes underneath the microburst. However, during this phase, the horizontal wind speed is reduced to 0 knots. Beyond the center of the microburst: After passing through the center of the microburst, the wind conditions shift again. The tailwind increases, leading to a sudden reduction in airspeed. The decrease in airspeed results in decreased lift, causing the aircraft to sink. In summary, the aircraft initially experiences a headwind, then encounters downdrafts under the microburst, and finally encounters a tailwind beyond the microburst.",

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. => Out of the available options, an uncontrollable fire will force the aircraft to land as soon as possible. All remaining options offer the possibility to continue flying to attempt landing at an off-airport. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications â one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "BRAKE SYSTEM OVERHEAT CONDITION A braking system works by converting the kinetic energy of a moving aircraft into heat. To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode. Water spray will cool the air in the fire zone but not directly the wheel. Statement 2 refers to a spray atomizer - meaning that only some kind of steam or water vapour is used, which cools much slower.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE: Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplaneâs glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraftâs rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "In this question, the aircraft is still parked on stand and awaiting clearance. While a visual inspection from inside the aircraft is an option, it would only allow a view of the main wing normally. If time permits an external inspection would be preferable as the pilot could possibly inspect all critical surfaces and also perform a tactile test for clear ice. The Learning Objective states: The pre-take-off check, which is the responsibility of the pilot-in-command, ensures that the critical surfaces of the aircraft are free of ice, snow, slush or frost just prior to take-off. This check shall be accomplished as close to the time of take-off as possible and is normally made from within the aeroplane by visually checking the wings. The current feedback indicates that the correct answer is an external check, as the aircraft is still on the apron. Later, a pre-take-off check, at the holding point for example, and internally made would be the option. Further information here from EASA AIR OPS and ICAO Doc 9640 CAT. OP. MPA.250 Ice and other contaminants - ground procedures: âPre-take-off checkâ: The flight crew should continuously monitor the weather conditions after the de-icing/anti-icing treatment to assess whether the applied holdover time is still appropriate. Within the aircraftâs HOT and prior to take-off, the flight crew should check the aircraftâs wings or representative aircraft surfaces for frozen contaminants. âPre-take-off contamination checkâ: a check of the treated surfaces for contamination, performed when the HOT has been exceeded or if any doubt exists regarding the continued effectiveness of the applied anti-icing treatment. It is normally accomplished externally, just before commencement of the take-off run. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 2.

Wet ice is ice that is melting, or ice with a layer of water (any depth) on top. The various braking action of each surface is quite easy to work out. Compacted snow has a relatively rough surface, and with heavy weight will allow some movement of the snow beneath, allowing for some traction between tyres and the surface, especially if the tyres have good tread for snow operations. This will allow moderate and moderate-to-poor braking action in many cases. Ice, on the other hand, will not move, nor allow any purchase with treaded tyres (unless they are studded), but dry ice (not frozen carbon dioxide used in smoke machines) will at least have a small amount of traction with a (usually) grippy rubber tyre surface. Still, moderate-to-poor and poor braking action can be expected. Wet ice has the same downsides of ice, but now that top level traction is nearly completely gone, and the braking action can be expected to be poor to non-existent.",

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. The expected attitude of the aircraft in the water is always \"nose up\". In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

An ice-contaminated wing will stall at a lower angle of attack or higher airspeed than a clean wing (increased stall speed). The additional weight of the ice or snow adds to the total weight of the aircraft, increasing the lift required for the aircraft to take off. Consequently, the take-off distance also increases.

            "explanation": "The pitot-static instruments usually are very reliable. Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because raim air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it underreads in a climb and overreads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI unserviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off. This depends on the aircraft's mass, the speed when braking was commenced, the intensity of brakes applied and the ambient temperatures.",

Move passengers away from the immediate area, and remove any flammable items and have fire extinguishers ready in case. Considerations upon receiving a bomb threat in-flight: Large and rapid changes to pressure altitude should be avoided. If operationally possible, reduce the cabin differential pressure to zero by descending the aircraft to cabin altitude. Do not raise the cabin altitude. Maintain this cabin altitude until top of descent. When minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) and range considerations permit, descend aircraft to below 10 000 feet. Minimise manoeuvres and try to avoid turbulence. Consider carefully the choice between flying fast to minimise airborne time and flying slowly to minimise air loads and damage in the event of fuselage rupture. In most cases, the turbulent air penetration speed will be a reasonable compromise. Consider establishing landing configuration as soon as possible. If the bomb does go off and damages aircraft systems (hydraulic and/or electrical), the aircraft is already ready to be landed. On contacting the airfield of landing, request details of remote parking requirements and immediate availability of passenger steps. Advise airfield of need to remove passengers from vicinity of the aircraft to at least 200m in an upwind direction as quickly as possible.",

It is only contemplated when no other realistic option remains in an emergency. It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

Even if the decision is made to continue, the recognition of external wind shear signs should alert the pilot to pay close attention to the progress of the landing or takeoff by reference to the flight deck instruments. External clues that may be directly visible to the pilot include the following: a) strong, gusty surface winds, especially where the aerodrome is located near hills or where there are comparatively large buildings near the runway, indicating the possibility of local wind shear and turbulence; b) lenticular cloud (smooth lens-shaped altocumulus) indicating the presence of standing waves, usually downwind from a mountain; c) virga, i.e. precipitation falling from the base of a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground (especially under convective cloud) because downdrafts may still exist and reach the ground even though the precipitation itself has evaporated; d) roll cloud girding the base of a thunderstorm and advancing ahead of the rain belt, indicating the presence of a gust front; e) areas of dust raised by wind, particularly when in the form of a ring below convective clouds, indicating the presence of a downburst; f) wind socks responding to different winds; g) smoke plumes sheared, with upper and lower sections moving in different directions; and h) thunderstorms, which should always be assumed to have the capability of producing hazardous wind shear.

If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling âhotâ brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

Icing on the ground happens primarily due to hoar frost, cold-soaked fuel frost, freezing rain, and ground contamination. For instance, the wheel wells would not usually build up any ice in flight, but any snow, slush or cold water can get splashed up into them on the ground, particularly during taxi, which can lead to mechanical problems with the gear retraction, etc. In flight, icing primarily occurs due to the accretion of super-cooled water droplets onto the leading edge surfaces, which can form rime, clear or mixed ice. Freezing rain can also occur, but it will form differently than if the aircraft were on the ground, due to the high airflow causing the droplets to drip down the aircraft surfaces. This is before considering the effects of any in flight anti-icing/de-icing systems and on the ground anti-icing/de-icing processes. It is not possible to determine which builds up more ice, being on the ground or in flight, as the conditions are very different. Icing is also very critical on the ground or in flight, as a take-off without removing icing can be disastrous. Therefore, we only have one option left (the most vague one) which is that they are different, and can occur in different places and in different amounts, which is completely true.",

            "explanation": "IN-FLIGHT FIRE Fire in the air is one of the most hazardous situations that a flight crew can be faced with. Without aggressive intervention by the flight crew, a fire on board an aircraft can lead to the catastrophic loss of that aircraft within a very short space of time. The axiom âAviate, Navigate, Communicateâ teaches pilots to fly the airplane first, then navigate, and once the situation is under control, communicate. This is one of the rules that pilots should live by! This is a common approach to all flying situations, especially emergency conditions. Before anything else, remember to fly the aircraft and maintain it under control. Only when time permits, communicate with ATC. Then the appropriate drill for the aircraft type must be carried out, which normally would include turning off the cabin recirculation fans and going to override on the avionics blower and extract valves, in order to start eliminating the smoke, and turning the power to the galleys and cabin accessories off. Most critically, if the source of the smoke cannot be positively identified or the fire immediately extinguished, the flight crew must initiate diversion, ditching or landing off-airfield immediately. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Option (a) \"The actions to be taken by the crew may be type specific\" is correct with regard to smoke and fire in the cabin. The actions that the crew should take in the event of smoke or fire in the cabin can vary depending on the type of aircraft and the procedures established by the operator. Therefore, it is important for the crew to be familiar with the specific procedures and emergency checklists for their aircraft type. Option (b) \"Opening the checklist is the highest priority\" is not correct. The highest priority in the event of smoke or fire in the cabin is to immediately initiate the appropriate emergency procedures, which may include donning oxygen masks, and beginning an emergency descent. Option (c) \"A MAYDAY call should be transmitted first\" is also not correct. While it is important to transmit a MAYDAY call to air traffic control in the event of an emergency, the immediate actions taken by the crew to control the situation and ensure the safety of the passengers and crew are the highest priority. Option (d) \"Immediately open the cockpit security door\" is also not correct. Opening the cockpit security door during an emergency situation could compromise the safety and security of the flight deck. The crew should follow established procedures and protocols for responding to smoke or fire in the cabin. Furthermore, if there is smoke/fumes in the cabin, you want to keep it away from the flight deck as much as possible, by keeping the door closed.",

It may be because there is a growing fire onboard and/or it is not possible to reach a runway, or succeed with an approach to those runways within reach and the situation does not favour or even allow an attempt at an off-airport forced landing. The following is a list of generally accepted considerations and techniques for ditching: Power On. If there is a choice in the matter, power on is preferable to power off for ditching. Use of power allows more control of both the rate of descent and point at which touchdown is made. Reduce Aircraft Weight. A lighter aircraft allows a lower approach speed and will probably remain afloat higher in the water and for longer thus facilitating occupant evacuation. Burning off or dumping fuel also has the advantage of increasing buoyancy in some aircraft types by creating a larger air mass held within the fuel tanks. Configuration. Gear up is the optimum configuration for ditching. Most manufacturers recommend the maximum deployment of available slats/flaps is desirable to minimise approach speed. In ideal conditions (smooth water or very long swells) land into the wind. This will ensure the minimum possible touchdown speed and help minimise impact damage. Where the swell is more marked, it may be advisable to ditch along the swell accepting a crosswind component and the higher touchdown speed, thus minimising the potential for nosing into the face of the rising swell. The best touchdown point is on the top of the swell with the second best on the back of the swell. Aim to remain well clear of the advancing face of the swell.",

They are used in the second step of a two-step procedure Type III is used in the same way as type II and IV, but is designed for slow speed aircraft. No anti-icing protection is effective indefinitely, there is a time limit during which the anti-icing protection can be considered reliable, this is the HOLDOVER TIME. Looking at the 4 answers to this question: Protection time up to 24 hours â INCORRECT as this is far too long in duration. Holdover times vary as listed below, but are usually measured in minutes, not days. Protection against icing for the duration of the flight â INCORRECT as anti-ice fluid is designed for ground use and to protect the airframe until take-off. In-flight protection would be offered from the aircraft's own systems, such as boots or bleed air. Limited holdover time depending on outside air temperature â CORRECT as outside air temperature is a factor in determining the holdover time. See below for more details on these factors. Limited time of protection independent of the outside temperature â INCORRECT as outside air temperature is a factor for the holdover time. See below for more details on these factors. The factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and Holdover Time include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature).",

Start by setting maximum take-off power. (2) Pitch. Pitch upâ way up to the edge of a stall. Hold the pitch angle until you get the first stall-warning indication or stick shaker, then relax it just enough to stop the stall warning. Then raise the nose a bit again until you again get the stall warning. Repeat until you are clear of the downburst or microburst. Weâre flying at the edge of the stall because thatâs where the wing creates maximum lift. Note that indicated airspeed, vertical speed and altimeter readings may be unreliable due to rapid changes in wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Thus, itâs best to fly angle of attack. If your aircraft is not equipped with an angle of attack indicator, use the stall warning as discussed. (3) Configuration. As previously stated, a windshear escape is not a normal climb or go around. Thus, the aircraft configuration (gear and flaps position) should be maintained until youâre safely out of the burst. It is a fact that the aircraft will climb better when clean, but getting clean often sacrifices a little performance or altitude that you canât afford. Only handle the power and the yoke.",

Depending upon user selection, the diluter-demand regulator can provide 100% oxygen (100 % mode), 100% oxygen under positive pressure (EMERGENCY mode) or a mixture of oxygen \"diluted\" with cabin air on a specific, altitude based schedule (NORMAL mode). In normal mode, a valve in the regulator unit opens to allow cabin air into the mask to mix with oxygen when you are flying at an altitude that permits dilutes oxygen supply. As you climb, the flow through the valve progressively decreases. Above approximately 32 000 ft, the valve remains closed to provide 100 % oxygen for inhalation.",

How to Use a Fire Extinguisher Even though extinguishers come in a number of shapes and sizes, they all operate in a similar manner. Here's an easy acronym for fire extinguisher use: P A S S -- Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep (1) Hold the fire extinguisher upright. Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher that keeps the handle from being accidentally pressed; (2) Aim the nozzle toward the base of the fire; (3) Stand approximately 8 feet (2.5 m) away from the fire and squeeze the handle to discharge the extinguisher. If you release the handle, the discharge will stop; (4) Sweep the nozzle back and forth at the base of the fire and slowly move forward to extinguish the remaining fire. After the fire appears to be out, watch it carefully since it may re-ignite!",

If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location.

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications â one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In calm winds, wing tip vortices separate outwards on each side of the runway. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplaneâs glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraftâs rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

Assess conditions: outside air temperature and precipitation. 2. The first entry in the table in OAT, which for us is -4Â°C. This takes us to the second column. 3. From here, we consider the current precipitation: very light snow and light rain. Note 5 of the table states: 'Use light freezing rain holdover times in conditions of very light or light snow mixed with light rain or drizzle.' 4. For the above reason we use the Holdover time for Light Freezing Rain and read directly from the table: '0:02 - 0:05'.",

Steel brake wear is directly proportional to the kinetic energy absorbed by the brakes. Maximum steel brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a large number of small, light brake applications, allowing some time for brake cooling between applications. High airplane gross weights and high brake application speeds tend to reduce steel brake life because they require the brakes to absorb a large amount of kinetic energy. Carbon brake wear is primarily dependent on the total number of brake applications â one firm brake application causes less wear than several light applications. Maximum carbon brake life can be achieved during taxi by using a small number of long, moderately firm brake applications instead of numerous light brake applications. This can be achieved by allowing taxi speed to increase from below target speed to above target speed, then using a single firm brake application to reduce speed below the target and repeating if required, rather than maintaining a constant taxi speed using numerous brake applications. Carbon brake wear is much less sensitive to airplane weight and speed than steel brake wear.",

Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off until touchdown. 2. The engines action (propellers rotation or engine gas exhausts) --> INCORRECT. This will disturb the airflow behind the engine, but does not contribute to wake turbulence, which is from wingtip vortices. 3. The importance of the drag devices (size of the landing gear, of the flaps, etc.) --> INCORRECT. Wake turbulence is caused by wingtip vortices. The use of flaps will affect the amount of turbulence, (lowering flaps decreases wake turbulence) but is not a main contributor in creating it, which is the question here.

            ],
            "explanation": "Looking at the answers: 'Total loss of one of the three available hydraulic systems, on an aircraft with flight controls that are hydraulically powered.' --> INCORRECT. Only one of three hydraulic systems has failed. This would lead the crew into the abnormal check list, but at this stage, seems unlikely to require an emergency landing. The aircraft would operate normally on the remaining two systems. 'An in-flight fire in the forward galley that has been positively identified as extinguished.' --> INCORRECT. An in-flight fire would be an interesting answer here, but this option then states that the fire is now extinguished. 'A total loss of the automatic pressurisation system just after take-off requiring manual intervention by the crew.' --> INCORRECT. Although the automatic system has failed, the crew have identified the issue and have regained control through manual intervention. There is no need for an emergency landing at this time. 'Multiple bird strikes during the take-off roll that cause an engine failure and erratic operation of the remaining engine.' --> CORRECT. Not a perfect answer as there is no mention of when the bird strikes occurred in relation to V1. However, the question asks about an emergency landing so an assumption could be made that the examiner is thinking after V1. Besides, all the other answers are a lot weaker. TYPES OF EMERGENCY LANDINGS The different types of emergency landings are defined as follows: Forced landingâan immediate landing, on or off an airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further flight. A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landingâa premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing engine trouble. Ditchingâa forced or precautionary landing on water.",

In the case of shipments under special arrangement, mixing is not permitted except as specifically authorized under the special arrangement. The intensity of radioactive material is measured in transport indices (TI) which are the amount of milisieverts (unit of radiation) received by a person at a distance of 1 m from the package. Each consignment is labelled with the number of TIs and this determines the category (I - 0 TI, II - 0.1 to 1 TI, III - more than 1 TI). If a large number of packages with low radiation is placed next to each other, the effects add up and they can be more dangerous than a single package of a higher category. Hence the requirement to maintain a specific distance between two radioactive packages so that their intensity can be considered independently.

To prevent damage to the tyres and undercarriage structure, the heat energy must be dissipated rapidly into the surrounding air. If this does not happen and the amount of heat generated becomes excessive, as can be the case after an aborted take off or following a landing at an excessive mass and/or speed, the tyres can overheat and burst. Consequently, brake and/or wheel fires are likely to occur. To prevent tyres bursting due to overheating, wheels are fitted with fusible plugs which melt at a preset temperature. This allows the tyre to deflate at a steady controlled rate. The usual strategies for cooling âhotâ brakes include: Giving consideration to an appropriate parking area (i.e. use a remote location, away from other aircraft, buildings), parking into the wind; Chocking the nose wheel and releasing the parking brake (the brake temperatures may be so high that the brakes may weld together and, consequently, do not release even after the brakes cool down); and Using brake fans when available. Should a fire develop, more direct intervention is required. Responders must exercise caution when approaching burning or overheated wheel assemblies as, so long as the wheels remain inflated, there is a risk of explosive failure of the wheel assembly laterally. Any approach to the wheel should therefore be conducted from the front or back. When extinguishing a wheel fire, sand or dry powder should be used to cover the fire and cut the oxygen supply. Some extinguishers will cool the landing gear too quickly and the wheel may explode.",

The risks of overheated brakes include loss of braking efficiency leading to runway overrun, burst tyres and even wheel fire. If brakes are applied during a rejected take-off or after landing, they must be cooled down to ambient temperature before another movement (most likely another take-off) is attempted. Most manufacturers provide AFM data for quick turn-arounds, specifying the minimum cooling time between braking and a new take-off.

External clues that may be directly visible to the pilot include the following: a) strong, gusty surface winds, especially where the aerodrome is located near hills or where there are comparatively large buildings near the runway, indicating the possibility of local wind shear and turbulence; b) lenticular cloud (smooth lens-shaped altocumulus) indicating the presence of standing waves, usually downwind from a mountain; c) virga, i.e. precipitation falling from the base of a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground (especially under convective cloud) because downdrafts may still exist and reach the ground even though the precipitation itself has evaporated; d) roll cloud girding the base of a thunderstorm and advancing ahead of the rain belt, indicating the presence of a gust front (see 3.5.10); e) areas of dust raised by wind, particularly when in the form of a ring below convective clouds, indicating the presence of a downburst (see 5.1.2 and Figure 3-16); f) wind socks responding to different winds; g) smoke plumes sheared, with upper and lower sections moving in different directions; and h) thunderstorms, which should always be assumed to have the capability of producing hazardous wind shear.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 071.02.10.01.05: Explain the factors to be considered when deciding to conduct a precautionary/emergency landing or ditching. TYPES OF EMERGENCY LANDINGS The different types of emergency landings are defined as follows: Forced landingâan immediate landing, on or off an airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further flight. A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure. Precautionary landingâa premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but inadvisable. A precautionary landing differs from the forced landing in the availability of power and aircraft systems. It is, generally, less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The landing site will be at the earliest opportunity. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather, being lost, fuel shortage, gradually developing engine trouble, darkness approaching faster than anticipated (when the pilot does not have night flying experience). Ditchingâa forced or precautionary landing on water. Of course, all the options in this question are valid considerations. Weather, as described above, may make it impossible to land at all nearby aerodromes, perhaps. The landing surface nearby may be a dry, flat field or perhaps a disused aerodrome, making an off-airport landing safer, however, if it is a built up city, more chance of the pilot trying to continue out of that area. Nature of the emergency is self-explanatory. A fuel problem, increasing engine trouble, etc. does not require the aircraft to be on the ground immediately, whereas an uncontrollable fire does. If an aircraft is close to a suitable aerodrome, the choice will likely be made to land there, even if that means carrying some technical issues further. If many minutes or hours flight away from one, an off-airport landing may be required.",

The incorrect options may also be slightly different due to incomplete feedback. Any further feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank you! With the box being 0.6 m high and the cargo compartment being 1.2 m high, the top of the box of radioactive materials will be only 0.6 m from the top of the cargo compartment, which will certainly bring it within 1 m of the passenger compartment (a floor is unlikely to be more than 0.4 m deep). We think that the annex that we don't have yet will clear up any confusion about floor depth. This is therefore the reason the goods cannot be transported in this location, they are going to be too close to the passenger compartment.

It causes substantial reduction in friction between the airplane tires and the runway surface and results in poor or nil braking action at high speeds. High aircraft speed, standing water, slush, and a smooth runway texture are factors conductive to hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water or slush on the runway deeper than the tread depth of the tyres. A wedge of water builds up, lifting the tires away from the runway surface. The speed of the airplane, the depth of the water, and the air pressure in the tires are some of the factors that affect dynamic hydroplaning. Viscous hydroplaning can occur when oil or accumulated rubber combines with water on a runway, it forms an impenetrable layer of liquid your tires canât break through. This is especially problematic on smooth runways, and it can occur on just a thin film of water. Viscous hydroplaning typically occurs in the touchdown zone of the runway, where you get a build-up of black rubber deposit Reverted rubber hydroplaning is the result of a prolonged locked-wheel skid, in which reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway. Entrapped water is heated to form steam, which supports the tire off the pavement.",

You would not wait until late in the landing roll to engage reversers. 'Descend below the glide slope and touch down as close to the landing threshold as possible.' --> INCORRECT. Never descend below the glide slope in an attempt to mitigate for a contaminated runway. Doing so would risk landing short of the runway or with insufficient airspeed. 'Use reverse thrust when the speed is high and change to wheel braking when the speed reduces.' --> INCORRECT. Using reverse thrust at high speed is perfect but this answer states 'change to wheel braking'. Reverse thrust should be used in conjunction with wheel braking in these conditions. 'Avoid floating and apply more wheel braking earlier as their effect is better early in the landing roll.' --> CORRECT. According to the given information, the braking action is reported as GOOD / MEDIUM / MEDIUM. The pilot needs to maximise the GOOD braking available in the 1st third of the runway. Perform an early and firm touchdown. Early as runway behind you is no use, firm to ensure that the wheels break through any surface contamination and make contact with the runway. Decelerate as much as you can as soon as you can: aerodynamic drag and reverse thrust are most effective at high speed.",

Type I fluid is the least effective and it is used mostly for de-icing (for washing the aircraft, mixed with hot water). It provides very limited protection for about 5 minutes. It is used only to clean the aircraft when further icing is not expected or as the first step of a two-step procedure. Type II and IV are used interchangeably for anti-icing, either diluted or not. They are used in the second step of a two-step procedure Type III is used in the same way as type II and IV, the only difference is that it is designed for slower regional aircraft. No anti-icing protection is effective indefinitely - anti-icing fluids will slowly run down along the curved wingâs surface. Therefore, there is a time limit during which the anti-icing protection can be considered reliable. Numerous factors that can affect the de-icing/anti-icing performance and HOTs of de-icing/anti-icing fluids have been identified. These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature).",

These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

            "explanation": "WAKE TURBULENCE Whenever an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wing tips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway. General Guides: To avoid turbulence when landing behind a large aircraft, stay above the large airplaneâs glide path and land beyond its touchdown point. If a large airplane has just taken-off as you approach, touch down well before the large aircraftâs lift-off point. When departing after a large aircraft has landed, lift-off beyond its touchdown location. When taking-off behind a large aircraft, lift-off before the large aircraftâs rotation point and climb out above or upwind of its flight path.",

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. Slow decompression involves a very gradual decrease in cabin pressure and it may be the result of a faulty door seal, a malfunction in the pressurization system, or a cracked window. Slow decompression may not always be obvious. In some cases an unusual noise, such as whistling or hissing sound around the door areas, may be an indication of a slow decompression, therefore the flight crew should be notified immediately. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or âpoppingâ, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. Explosive decompression is likely to occur when a large part of the cabin structure fails. Windshield, cabin windows, and door failures are typical causes of explosive decompressions. Rapid/explosive decompression is dramatic and, in many cases, can be recognized by the following signs: A loud bang, thump or clap that is the result of the sudden contact between the internal and external masses of air; The cabin fills with fog/mist due to the immediate condensation of water vapour in the cabin; Rush of air, as the air exits the cabin; After the decompression, the cabin is extremely cold because most of the heated air is drawn out and the remaining air cools as it expands; The release of the cabin oxygen masks, when the cabin altitude reaches 14 000 feet. If a breach in the aircraft structure is the cause of the decompression unsecured items in the immediate area are ejected from the aircraft, debris may fly around the cabin, loose items may become projectiles and dust particles may limit visibility.",

(Source: ICAO Doc 9640 âManual of Aircraft Ground De-icing/Anti-icing Operationsâ; CAT. OP. MPA.250 âIce and other contaminants â ground proceduresâ) CAT. OP. MPA.250 Ice and other contaminants â ground procedures (a) The operator shall establish procedures to be followed when ground de-icing and anti-icing and related inspections of the aircraft are necessary to allow the safe operation of the aircraft. (b) The commander shall only commence take-off if the aircraft is clear of any deposit that might adversely affect the performance or controllability of the aircraft, except as permitted under (a) and in accordance with the AFM. Some of the many effects of icing are: - Aerodynamic: Lift can be reduced by as much as 30% and drag increased by up to 40%. This reduction in lift causes an increase in the aircraft's stall speed, which is particularly bad during and just after take-off. - Weight: Ice adds considerably to the mass of the aeroplane and affects the centre of gravity. - Instruments: Ice forming on pitot tubes, static vents or angle of attack vanes can cause errors in indications and give false attitude, airspeed, angle of attack and engine power information for air data systems. - Windscreen and canopies can become obscured. - Thrust can be reduced by ice building up on propellers or onto the blades and hubs of jet engines. - Contamination on wings and control surfaces can cause a significant change in flight characteristics and controllability, as well as jammed controls and a reduction of the safe flight envelope.",

Clogged probes and damaged sensors may lead to inconsistent speed, altitude and attitude information or disagreement among instruments. Engine damage may range from dented compressor blades to vibration and engine failure. Windscreens may be shattered, impeding clear vision of the pilot, or in the worst-case causing decompression. Other parts of the airframe also commonly suffer from damage after a bird-strike, although it normally does not result in any critical failure in flight.

            "explanation": "CABIN DECOMPRESSION Although cabin pressurization systems are highly reliable, malfunctions do occur with system components or aircraft structures. Of the malfunctions that can occur, cabin decompression is the most serious. The loss of pressurization can be slow - in case of a small air leak - while a rapid or explosive decompression occurs suddenly, usually within a few seconds. One of the first physiological indications of a slow decompression may be ear discomfort or âpoppingâ, joint pain, or stomach pain due to gas expansion. The most immediate physiological indications of a rapid decompression include rapid hypoxia symptoms and, in severe cases, the eardrum can rupture, causing bleeding or leaking of fluid from the ear.",

These factors include, but are not limited by the following: a) type and rate of precipitation; b) ambient temperature; c) relative humidity; d) wind direction and velocity; including jet blast; e) aeroplane surface (skin) temperature; and f) de-icing/anti-icing fluid (type, fluid/water ratio, temperature). CAUTION Owing to the many variables that can influence HOTs, the time of protection may be reduced or extended, depending on the intensity of the weather conditions. Heavy precipitation, high moisture content, high wind velocity and jet blast can reduce HOT below the lowest time in HOT guidelines. HOT may be reduced when aircraft skin temperature is lower than outside air temperature. Weather conditions for which no HOT guidelines exist are referenced in the HOT guidelines.",

Note: In a two step process, the hold over time will include the time taken to apply the last step of anti-icing fluid, complete checks and paperwork and to depart the aerodrome. If the hold over time expires prior to take-off, then the aircraft can not depart until de-iced and anti-iced again. ICAO Doc 9640 Chapter 5.

Gross errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the static port, or both. Blockage can be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. PITOT BLOCKAGE The airspeed indicator is the only instrument affected by a pitot tube blockage. If the pitot system becomes completely clogged and the static system remains clear, the indicator reacts as an altimeter, showing an increase in airspeed when climbing and a decrease in speed when descending. As the descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed. The opposite would happen in a climb. STATIC BLOCKAGE If the static system becomes clogged the airspeed indicator continues to react to changes in airspeed, because ram air pressure is still being supplied by the pitot tube, but the readings are not correct. The ASI will reverse the error that occurs with a blocked pitot, it under reads in a climb and over reads in a descent. Because the altimeter determines altitude by measuring ambient air pressure, any blockage of the static port freezes the altimeter in place and makes it unusable. The Vertical Speed indicator freezes at zero, because its only source of pressure is from the static port. After verifying a blockage of the static system, an alternate source of static pressure should be used. If the aircraft is not equipped with an alternate static source, the glass of the vertical speed indicator can be broken to allow ambient air pressure to enter the static system. This, however, makes the VSI un-serviceable. If, while in level flight, it becomes necessary to use an alternate source of static pressure vented inside the aeroplane, the altimeter might read a little higher and the airspeed a little faster than normal, and the vertical speed indicator might show a momentary climb.",

The engineer will inspect the work when it is complete and then sign the maintenance release to confirm all was done correctly.

Looking at the other answers: 'The Commander should ask the engineer to explain how he / she can sign the maintenance release when he / she was NOT involved in the work, nor did he / she watch it being carried out' --> INCORRECT as the engineer does NOT need to do the work, only inspect it on completion. The work could be done by another engineer or a technician. 'The Commander must ask the engineer to get the technician who completed the work to sign a maintenance release' --> INCORRECT. Technicians are NOT qualified to sign the maintenance release. They can carry out the work but only the engineer can sign this document.

The T9 route (Southerly) would be available, but none of the options mention this, so the option of continuing the flight through domestic airspace is the best one. This is not mentioned in the regulation above from NAT Doc. 007, as that document is written more for Atlantic crossings, where continuing to the destination via domestic airspace is often not possible. As for the other options not already covered; Special approval will not allow them to fly the T16 route with 1 LRNS; and Flights can be made in the NAT HLA with just one LRNS along blue spruce routes and along T9 and T290 of the \"tango routes\".",

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1)aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2)the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3)the direction to an alternate airport; 4)any strategic lateral offset being flown and, 5)terrain clearance 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK If possible maintain the assigned flight level until established on the 9.3 km (5.0 NM) parallel, same direction track or route offset. If unable, initially minimize the rate of descent to the extent that is operationally feasible. 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.

However, especially if flight crews are changing to a new system, there is a risk that at some stage (e.g. during partial system failure, re-clearances, etc.), confusion may arise in selecting the correct values. Operators should therefore devise procedures which will reduce this risk, as well as ensuring that the subject is covered during training.

HORIZONTAL COMPONENT The horizontal component (H) of the earthâs field is known as the directive force and it is the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian (providing a directional reference). Near the magnetic poles, the vertical component becomes much greater than at lower latitudes where the horizontal component dominates. This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

FTL.205(e) âMaximum daily FDP with the use of extensions due to in-flight restâ This question is poorly worded, as it fails to specify whether the flight crew is augmented or not. However, it can be inferred from the option \"Depending on the crew rest facilities available\" that an augmented crew is available, so inflight rest may be used. This is the only plausible explanation for this question. The other options are incorrect. While the commander has the authority to decide on duty extension or rest shortening, this only applies in the case of unforeseen circumstances. At home base or company hubs, standby or reserve crew members should be available to avoid the exercise of the commander's discretion. The operator may decide to extend the FDP, but it must be planned in advance, which is not the case here. Regardless, it appears that this question is missing critical information, which may affect its accuracy. As a result, we suggest disputing this question if you encounter it during your official exam. EASA AIR OPS - ORO.

(This should be part of the VAPP/VREF safety margin, so we would not usually change the speed, but this answer is much more correct than reducing speed.) On wet/flooded or slush covered runways the tire may hydroplane which reduces the braking forces between the tire and runway significantly. Therefore, in such conditions, a positive (firm, not hard) landing is required to break through the layers of water on the runway, thus minimising the risk of aquaplaning. A \"greaser of a landing\" is most certainly not the answer, because you will only add to the risk of aquaplaning. Furthermore wheel spin-up can be delayed on slippery runways, which affects the proper functioning of the antiskid system and the deployment of ground spoilers. When on the runway, you should apply reverse thrust and lift dumper devices. The lift dumpers are basically ground spoilers that are used to 'dump' lift which, consequently, puts the weight down on the wheels and increases control/braking action.",

Detailed instructions should be laid down for dealing with fuel spillage When it refers to the correct earthing procedure, that is just a case of making sure that all of the aircraft and fuel pump components are properly bonded together and all electricaly grounded, to let any static electricity dissipate, before removing fuel caps and beginning the fuelling procedure. Sometimes this bonding procedure is actualy done between aircraft and fuel bowser rather than the ground, if it is on a fuel truck.

(b) Aeroplanes may be operated without the navigation equipment specified in (6) and (7) provided they are equipped with alternative equipment. The reliability and the accuracy of alternative equipment should allow safe navigation for the intended route.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Annex 6 Chapter 1. Definitions Navigation specification. A set of aircraft and flight crew requirements needed to support performance-based navigation operations within a defined airspace. There are two kinds of navigation specifications: Required navigation performance (RNP) specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that includes the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNP, e.g. RNP 4, RNP APCH. Area navigation (RNAV) specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that does not include the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNAV, e.g. RNAV 5, RNAV 1. Note 1.â The Performance-based Navigation (PBN) Manual (Doc 9613), Volume II, contains detailed guidance on navigation specifications. Note 2.â The term RNP, previously defined as âa statement of the navigation performance necessary for operation within a defined airspaceâ, has been removed from this Annex as the concept of RNP has been overtaken by the concept of PBN. The term RNP in this Annex is now solely used in the context of navigation specifications that require performance monitoring and alerting, e.g. RNP 4 refers to the aircraft and operating requirements, including a 4 NM lateral performance with on-board performance monitoring and alerting that are detailed in Doc 9613. Whilst Annex 6 does say the term RNP has been mostly removed, the basic definition of it still stands, but is now more complex in terms of PBN operations, which can be found in ICAO doc. 9613. The other possible answers are also nowhere near correct.",

NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO NAT Doc 007 Chapter 8 Position Plotting 8.2.12 Plotting the aircraftâs progress on a chart can be a useful tool for contingency situations. In the event of a total loss of long range navigation capability, a completed plotting chart will assist in the necessary reversion to dead reckoning. In other contingency situations it can help in assessing separation assurance from other tracks or from high terrain (e.g over Greenland). Chapter 12 Complete Failure of Navigation Systems Computers 12.2.9 A characteristic of the navigation computer system is that the computer element might fail, and thus deprive the aircraft of steering guidance and the indication of position relative to cleared track, but the basic outputs of the IRS (LAT/LONG, Drift and Ground speed) are left unimpaired. A typical drill to minimise the effects of a total navigation computer system failure is suggested below. It requires comprehensive use of the plotting chart. a) use the basic IRS/GPS outputs to adjust heading to maintain mean track and to calculate ETAs. b) draw the cleared route on a chart and extract mean true tracks between way points. c) at intervals of not more than 15 minutes plot position (LAT/LONG) on the chart and adjust heading to regain track.",

RNP 10 does not include requirements for on-board performance monitoring and alerting. For purposes of consistency with the PBN concept, RNP 10 is referred to as RNAV 10 in this manual. Renaming current RNP 10 routes, operational approvals, etc., to an RNAV 10 designation would be an extensive and expensive task, which is not cost-effective.

The examiner has simply re-imagined this as FL60 and above. The controlled airspace vertical dimensions do vary and the lowest level listed is 2000 ft above ground level in Jan Mayen, a Norwegian volcanic island approximately 1000 km north of Iceland. Incidentally, Canada, Denmark and Iceland require that both the flight crew and aircraft be IFR rated for transoceanic flight, regardless of the altitude to be flown. Do not confuse this question with the HLA (High Level Airspace) which has vertical dimensions between FL 285 and 420. 15.3 NORTH ATLANTIC FLIGHT OPERATIONS 15.3.1 Most of the airspace in oceanic FIRs/OCAs is high seas airspace within which the Rules of the Air (ICAO Annex 2) apply without exception. The majority of the airspace is also controlled airspace, and instrument flight rules (IFR) apply when above FL 055. 15.3.2 This controlled airspace includes: 1. New York Oceanic East, Gander Oceanic, Shanwick Oceanic, Santa Maria Oceanic, Reykjavik Oceanic, GOTA and NOTA, and BodÃ¸; 2. BodÃ¸ Oceanic above FL 195 and when operating more than 100 NM seaward from the shoreline; 3. Nuuk FIR when operating above FL 195: 4. Faroes Islands above 7500 ft; 5. Jan Mayen 2000 ft above ground level. 15.3.3 Canada, Denmark and Iceland require that the flight crew and aircraft be IFR rated for transoceanic flight, regardless of the altitude to be flown.

            "explanation": "Important Note: This question is from brand new feedback and is currently unverified. We think that the question may come with a specific NAT track message, and identify a specific route, but as yet we cannot be sure. Please let us know if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it, so we can get it as accurate as possible, thank you! Performance Based Communications and Surveillance (PBCS) PBCS standards were introduced in the NAT HLA for aircraft that meet the âRequired Communication Performanceâ (RCP) and âRequired Surveillance Performanceâ (RSP) specifications which ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. Performance-based operations and monitoring have been implemented in the NAT HLA to ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. The performance of FANS equivalent, CPDLC, and ADS-C aircraft are monitored in the NAT HLA against RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications. Separation of PBCS aircraft remains an air traffic control function and responsibility. When an aircraft does not meet RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications, ATC shall provide standard separation criteria. Aircrew must report any failure or malfunction of GNSS, ADS-C, or CPDLC equipment to ATC as soon as it becomes apparent. For aircraft planning to operate in the NAT HLA, PBCS capabilities, when operational, are reflected in the ICAO flight plan as follows: Item 10a: FANS designator (e.g., J7); FANS CPDLC RCP 240 compliance designator (e.g., P2) Item 10b: FANS ADS-C compliance (D1 or G1 for ATN systems) Item 18: FANS ADS-C RSP 180 compliance (SUR/RSP180); FANS 4 compliance (PBN/L1) As for this question, technically, both RVSM and continuous availability for data-link communication are both correct. However, as all flights within the NAT HLA require RVSM (other than special cases), we are going to say that the continuous data-link is the most correct answer, given the wording of the question.",

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO Doc 007 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADSâC and ADSâB transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly selfâ selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when nonânormal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitudeâkeeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as âStrategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)â. 8.5.9 This procedure provides for offsets within the following guidelines: a) an aircraft may fly offsets right of centreline up to a maximum of 2 NM; and b) offsets left of centreline are not permitted.",

If an unreliable airspeed condition occurs, the flight crew should be familiar with the approximate pitch attitude and thrust setting for each phase of flight. Once flight path is under control and the airplane is not in a critical phase of flight, the crew shall try to identify the erraneous airspeed indication. To determine if a reliable source of indicated airspeed is available, the flight crew should assess and compare flight deck indications. To aid the identification of a reliable airspeed indication, ground speed information is available from the FMC (from the INS/GNSS) and on the intrument displays. These indications can be used as a cross-check. Note: Although this question falls outside the scope of Operational Procedures (070), a student has confirmed that they found it on their exam.",
