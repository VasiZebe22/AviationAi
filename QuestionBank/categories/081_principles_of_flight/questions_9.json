The airflow behind a shockwave is turbulent and can cause a rapid vibrating movement of the horizontal stabilizer surfaces and is often referred to as the ‘shock stall’ and is the primary cause of high-speed buffet. A secondary cause of the rapid movement of the control surfaces, especially with supercritical airfoil sections, is when the wing reaches a speed of MCRIT the relatively weak shockwave that forms moves rapidly backward and forward over the surface of the wing producing similar indications to those of the shock stall.",

Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is called the transition point. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction.

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d.

            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

This turbulent flow hitting the tailplane and elevator is the primary cause of the natural buffeting felt in some aeroplanes. If an aircraft does not present with natural buffeting before the stall, then stall warners or stick shakers will be fitted to warn of the impending stall. As for the other options: The centre of pressure does move aft during the stall of most wings, which helps provide the necessary pitch down moment to break the stall and begin recovery, however, it is not the cause of any buffeting. A stall occurring over the section of the wing with ailerons would cause aileron buffeting through the controls, but this means the wing is completely stalled, not pre-stall, as the wing root is designed to stall first, and the wing tips are designed to stall last, to preserve aileron effectiveness in the stall and prevent wing drops.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. Note: Flying in turbulent conditions may cause sudden changes in speed and load factor. Looking at the buffet margin graph attached, we can conclude that both speed/mach variations and changes in load factor may bring the aircraft closer to one of the buffet margins.",

As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces. As a result, the vertical speed will reduce for a certain pitch attitude. The autopilot will therefore chase the selected vertical speed by pitching up. This results in further decreased IAS.

In a spin, the aircraft is stalled but not evenly, and the inside wing has a higher angle of attack so is stalled more than the outside wing, creating a continuous spiraling stall, called a spin. The way to recover from a stall is given in the POH, but a general rule for most aircraft is as follows. P - Retard the throttle to idle. In most aircraft, power hampers the recovery. A - Ailerons neutral. Many pilots will attempt to recover from the spin using the ailerons. This may actually make the problem worse. R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline. Remember to neutralize the rudder after the rotation stops. The application of aft elevator pressure could quite easily send the aircraft into a further stall/spin, as this would try to continue increasing the angle of attack. However, if the aircraft becomes fully unstalled, then this action may actually take the aircraft into a spiral dive instead and potentially overload the wings with high load factor. As for the other options, a secondary spin in the other direction usually comes from continuing to apply rudder after recovering (with too low airspeed) and yaw instability is not related to this scenario. The aircraft is also descending through this process, so no climb rate should be expected.",

At low altitudes, these speeds are far apart, leaving a wide range of operating speeds. Although stalling IAS remains constant at first as altitude increases, it starts to increase at higher altitude. Also, the IAS at which we get Mach buffet will steadily decrease, because TAS increases in the climb and local speed of sound decreases. The two buffet boundaries will move closer toogether and eventually meet at an altitude where no margins exists, the coffin corner or aerodynamic ceiling, i.e. you cannot fly faster or slower because you will either stall or hit MMO. The right-hand limit on the graph shows the maximum indicated airspeed VMO and then at high altitude the maximum Mach number, MMO. The left-hand limit is based on the stall speed, 1.1 VS.

Consequently, more lift is required which means that the angle of attack must be increased. This will increase the stall speed. Any airplane, within the limits of its structure and the strength of the pilot, can be stalled at any airspeed. VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. In this exercise: Start by drawing a line from de 30° bank that intersects the 140-ton curve. From here, draw a straight line from right to left that intersects the FL360 curve. The goal is to have to intersection points, which correspond to the lowest and highest limits of the buffet boundaries.

            "explanation": "Wing sweep is a tendency for first stalling the wingtip and a pitch-up moment. Both are unwanted stall characteristics which can lead to a deep stall. This tendency can be reduced by design modifications (wing fences, vortilons and saw tooth leading edges) which minimize the root-to-tip spanwise flow of the boundary layer. These devices delay tip stall. Vortex generators are also frequently used on a swept wing to delay tip stall and improve the stall characteristics. The wing root can also be encouraged to stall first. This can be done by modifying the aerofoil section at the root, fitting stall strips and by fitting less efficient leading edge flaps (Kruger flaps) to the inboard section of the wing. During the recovery ailerons can be used with smooth and coordinated application of rudder.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

The correct option has been the same or very similar in all feedback so far, and therefore we have added this as a single question. Please inform us in the comments if you see this question in the exam, and please add information about anything different you remember, along with your exam authority, thank you! As you will likely know by this point, aircraft drag at low subsonic speeds is split into 2 components, parasite drag and induced drag. For unstalled flight, the induced drag decreases with speed and parasite drag increases with speed, as shown above, creating the familiar total drag graph. Therefore, as the pilot in question slows the aircraft down when close to the stall, the induced drag will increase quite significantly and the parasite drag will gradually decrease. When the aircraft does actually stall though, the rules become more complex. Induced drag is actually short for \"lift-induced drag\", and when the aircraft stalls, it loses a lot of lift, so therefore the lift induced drag decreases somewhat after the stall. Parasite drag, however, no longer fits the usual curve, as the aircraft now has a much larger frontal area, as it has a very high (fully stalled) angle of attack, and therefore the air is hitting the underside of the fuselage, wings and tailplane much more than previously. This is not streamlined at all, so the parasite drag increases after the stall, and the more stalled the aircraft gets, the larger the parasite drag. Together, this means that total drag continues increasing after the stall.",

Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions.

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Aircraft must therefore be operated with a (safety) margin to aerodynamic buffet. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved: - Load factor. - Mach number. - Angle of attack. - Pressure altitude. - Weight. - CG position. LOAD FACTOR Because load factor increases the stall speed, different curves can be drawn for all values of load factor up to the maximum permissible ‘g’, and together they constitute the set of stalling boundaries for the given aircraft. Such a set of curves is shown in attached figure. Superimposed on these curves are dashed lines representing lines of constant Mach number, showing how high Mach numbers can be achieved, even at relatively low EAS, at high altitudes. Encountering wind shear increases the load factor, which increases the stall speed. This means that the margin to the low speed buffet margin is decreased. Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries.",

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem, as the CP for an unswept wing will move backwards as the aircraft approaches and exceeds CLMAX. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

            "explanation": "Spinning is a condition of stalled flight in which an aircraft describes a downward spiral path, and is normally the by-product of wing drop when operating near the stall. THE INCIPIENT SPIN (figures 1 and 2) If the wing drops at the stall, the resulting rolling action alters the direction of the relative airflow on to the wing. It increases the angle of attack of the down-going wing and reduces the angle of attack of the up-going wing. The down-going wing becomes more stalled, leading to a reduction in the coefficient of lift and an increase in the coefficient of drag. Conversely, the up-going wing becomes less stalled, leading to an increase in the coefficient of lift and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. The difference in lift between the wings produces a rolling moment and the aircraft rolls in the direction of the down-going wing. The yawing moment resulting from the large difference in drag between the down-going and up-going wings further aids this. These moments lead to autorotation: the aircraft continues to roll, a side-slip develops, and the nose drops. Without corrective action, the rate of rotation steadily increases, resulting in a fully developed spin. FULLY DEVELOPED SPIN It is usual for the aircraft to rotate several times around a spin axis before settling into a steady state spin, with the final pitch attitude depending mainly on the position of the centre of gravity. The spin can be either flat or steep. This condition is reached when the rate of rotation and sink stabilise at constant values. When this occurs, the forces and moments acting are considered to be in equilibrium and the relative airflow comes vertically upward to meet the aircraft. FORWARD CG This results in a steeper spin and a faster rate of sink. This makes the recovery easier because the spin is less stable. AFT CG This results in a flatter spin and a lower rate of sink. This makes the recovery more difficult, because the spin is more stable. If the centre of gravity is aft of its permitted limits, it significantly reduces the likelihood of recovery from a settled spin condition. When an aircraft is in a steep spin rotation it is primarily in roll, whereas in a flat spin it is primarily in yaw. (figure 3)",

With the cg furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward cg then with a rearward cg. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its cg, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the cg will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A cg on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

Aerodynamic stall warnings may include one or more of the following indications: Heavy buffet of the elevator Higher than normal attitude Light and less effective controls Uncommanded pitch down Uncommanded roll Inability to maintain altitude or arrest a rate of descent. 2. Νon-aerodynamic stall warnings, in comparison with the aerodynamic ones, may include one or more of the following indications: Audible stall warning sounds Stick shaker activation Stick pusher NOTE: \"Heavy buffet on the elevator before approaching the stall\" is a bit vague, and is saying that the buffet occurs far before the stall, which is not usually the case. The aerodynamic buffet is usually noticeable just before the stall, and can either go away or become even worse during the stall, depending on the aircraft. This would fit the feedback that 3 and 4 is the correct answer in some states.",

            "explanation": "\"The aeroplane may suffer an excessive load factor and damage during the stall recovery exercises.\" Incorrect. The question's mention of \"excessive\" stick inputs, creates the impression that the aircraft might experience a high load factor and potential damage during recovery exercises. Nevertheless, the fact that they limit the speed increase to only 130 kt, well below VNE, minimizes the actual risk of structural damage. \"If too much elevator is used to recover from the spiral dive, the aeroplane may stall and enter a spin.\" Incorrect. If excessive pulling occurs and surpasses the critical angle of attack, the aircraft will stall. However, what the examiner likely intends is that when initially employing ailerons to level the wings and recover from a spiral dive, there's no need for an \"excessive\" application of elevator. The essence of the statement is to emphasize not pulling too hard at the detection of a spiral dive but prioritizing leveling the wings first. It's crucial to recall that in a spiral dive, the wings are not yet stalled, making it imperative to first halt the rolling moment and then initiate a pull to recover lost altitude. In contrast, a spin involves a stall, necessitating a recovery process of pushing the control stick initially, followed by maintaining neutral ailerons and applying rudder in the opposite direction of the spin. \"The rudder must be used to roll the wings level from the spiral dive, as the ailerons may cause excessive wing bending.\" Incorrect. In contrast to a spin, a recovery from a spiral dive involves initially leveling off to counteract the excessive static directional stability relative to lateral stability, thereby stopping the rolling moment. It's crucial to execute this maneuver cautiously to prevent any potential structural damage. If the rudder is applied before the ailerons in this situation, additional stress is imposed on the airframe because the aircraft is already in a nose-down attitude with a sideslip, further banking due to directional stability. This is why stall escape maneuvers or upset recovery procedures in commercial airliners explicitly avoid instructing the use of the rudder pedals.",

Wing Loading = Weight / Wing Area Any airplane, within the limits of its structure and the strength of the pilot, can be stalled at any airspeed. VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

The effect will be the same as for the wing; the stall will occur at a lower angle of attack. The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

A stick pusher is a system that will push the stick forward, lowering the nose and therefore decreasing the angle of attack to prevent a stall. The stick pushers will automatically disengage when the angle of attack reaches below a suitable value. Stick pushers are mandatory for aircraft that are prone to deep stalls. For an aircraft mounted with both the stick shaker system and stick pusher system, the sequence of events is as follows: First as a warning of impeding stall, the stick shaker will activate and a corrective action by the pilot is expected. As the angle of attack keeps increasing and reaches a pre set dangerous value that might be unrecoverable, the stick pusher will activate and force the nose down. The stick shaker will stay active during the entire duration of the stick pusher, but not vice versa. Therefore the stick shaker activates at a lower angle of attack than the stick pusher, and the stick pusher prevents the pilot from increasing the angle of attack further.",

This means that the two aircraft will be affected by thrust changes in different ways. We call the high mounted engines on aeroplane 1 \"thrust stabilising\", as they produce thrust through or above the line of our CG, so cause a small pitch down moment when extra thrust is applied, which gains airspeed. The underslung engines on aeroplane 2 have a much lower thrust line, so the aircraft will pitch up significantly when thrust is increased. This is a de-stabilising effect, as the airspeed may actually reduce with increased engine thrust, due to the pitch up moment. In the go-around then, aircraft 1 will handle as expected, with full thrust causing an acceleration, and pitch up command required to achieve the +12º go-around attitude. In aircraft 2, it is highly likely that applying full power will pitch the aeroplane so much nose up that the pilots will have to push on the controls to avoid over-rotating and losing valuable speed.

We can pretty much guarantee that the examiner will mix and match some options to catch out people who mistake the question for a different one.",

A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Aircraft with swept-back wings are prone to deep stall, regardless of horizontal stabilizer position (T-tail or low tail). T-tail will worsen recovery characteristics. Swept-forward wings at very high angle of attack are prone to deep stall as well. However, if a low horizontal tail is fitted, some pitch down moment may be produced with the help of the horizontal stabilizer since it is out of the separated turbulent wake of the wing. \"II. A stick shaker system is fitted to an aeroplane to resolve deep stall problems.\" INCORRECT A stick shaker, as the name suggests shakes the control colum warning the pilot of an impeding stall.

A deep stall happens when an aircraft main wing stalls, but the angle of airflow means that the stalled air flows directly over the horizontal tailplane. This usually happens on T-tail aircraft, as the tail often becomes about level with the wing at critical angle of attack. This turbulent flow will mean that there is little or no elevator control, and the horizontal stabiliser is not producing any controllable lift. This can leave the aircraft without any pitch control, causing a potentially unrecoverable deep stall (a.k.a. a super stall). Aircraft with deep stall characteristics are often fitted with a stick-pusher to avoid reaching that point. The other design feature they could ask about is underslung engines. Underslung engines are mounted under the main wings, as is most common on modern jets. When thrust is increased on these engines, a very large pitch-up moment is induced, due to their thrust line being far below the centre of gravity. As thrust is often added to recover from a stall, this could cause an upwards pitch which could overpower even full nose-down pitch control at low speeds. We call this thrust line \"destabilising\". The high mounted tail engines seen on many smaller jets are not susceptible to this effect, as they have a high thrust line and a \"stabilising\" thrust moment.",

The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Flying at a different speed will not influence the buffet boundaries, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. At altitude, the equivalent stalling speed increases with ‘g’ rather more rapidly than at sea level, because of the Mach number effect on CLMAX. Also, the buffet boundary becomes much more severe. Above a certain altitude the buffet boundary may intersect the stall boundary at a value of ‘g’ lower than the structural limit. This ‘point’ is another representation of “coffin corner”.

This will cause increased drag and may disrupt the boundary layer resulting in a significantly higher stall speed. EFFECT OF HEAVY RAIN ON STALL SPEED - Weight Heavy rain will form a film of water on an aircraft and increase its weight slightly, maybe as much as 1 - 2% this in itself will increase stall speed. - Aerodynamic Effect The film of water will distort the aerofoil, roughen the surface and alter the airflow pattern on the whole aircraft. CLMAX will decrease causing stall speed to increase. - Drag The film of water will increase interference drag, profile drag and form drag. In light rain, drag may increase by 5%, in moderate by 20% and in heavy rain by up to 30%. - Impact An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards. The volume of rain in any given situation will vary, but an aircraft on final approach which suddenly enters a torrential downpour of heavy rain will be subject to a loss of momentum and a decrease in altitude, similar to the effect of microburst windshear.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded.",

R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline.

The situation worsens if the nose is still high and the thrust setting low. - On leaving the downdraught, increasing tail winds cause a further reduction in IAS (Temporary Energy Loss). The rate of descent may lessen due to increased thrust availability. This may lead to a reduction in airspeed below the stalling speed and if operating at high angles of attack, which are normally associated with the approach and landing phases of flight, the wing may stall. A successful recovery from a microburst encounter depends on the altitude, thrust, and speed reserves available. In addition to these effects, severe wind, turbulence, heavy rain, and blinding flashes of lightning often accompany microbursts.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALL RECOVERY To recover from a stall or prevent a full stall, the angle of attack must be decreased to reduce the adverse pressure gradient. This may consist of merely releasing back pressure, or it may be necessary to smoothly move the pitch control forward, depending on the aircraft design and severity of the stall. Allow airspeed to increase and recover lost altitude with moderate back pressure on the pitch control. Pulling too hard could trigger a secondary stall, or worse, could exceed the limit load factor and damage the aircraft structure. As angle of attack reduces below the critical angle, the adverse pressure gradient will decrease, airflow will re-attach, and lift and drag will return to their normal values.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. In this exercise: Start by drawing a line from de 1g load factor that intersects the 130-ton curve. From here, draw a straight line from right to left that intersects the FL410 curve. The goal is to have to intersection points, which correspond to the lowest and highest limits of the buffet boundaries.

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

Trying to lift a dropping wing with aileron will increase its angle of attack, and may cause the wing to stall completely, resulting in that wing dropping at an increased rate. At speeds close to the stall, ailerons must be used with caution. On straight wing aircraft the rudder should be used to yaw the aircraft just enough to increase the speed of a dropping wing to maintain a wing’s level attitude. Swept wing aircraft basic stall requirements are designed to enable the ailerons to be used successfully up to ”stall recognition”, but small amounts of rudder can be used if smoothly applied and co-ordinated with the ailerons. If an aileron is lowered when flying at high angles of attack, that wing could possibly stall. In that case the wing will drop instead of rising as intended.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback for this question is quite limited, and there is another option that is very close to being correct, but we are happy with our choice of correct answer. Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this question, thank you! The vast majority of aircraft are never meant to stall, but it is always a possibility, no matter how many measures the designers put in to stop it occurring. This is why aircraft must be made to be controllable and predictable at stalling. In particular, we want the aircraft to have a nose down moment at the stall, and we want the controls to be effective at the stall. One way the controls could become ineffective at the stall is with a T-tail horizontal stabiliser design. Whilst a T-tail design usually takes the horizontal stabiliser away from the wake of the main wing, when the aircraft is pitched at the stalling angle of attack, often the horizontal stabiliser is in the zone of stalled airflow, where little to no lift can be gained. This is called a \"deep stall\" (or a super-stall) and makes the elevators quite useless, and even an all moving tailplane (which you would not usually find in a T-tail configuration) would be quite useless too. This is why most T-tail aircraft have a stall prevention device fitted called a stick pusher, which will put in a very strong pitch down control force just before the \"deep stall\" is reached. As we have already mentioned, there is another option present that is very close to correct. \"Aft mounted engines, as an increase in thrust produces a nose down moment.\" We call this a stabilising thrust line, because the addition of thrust helps us gain airspeed by causing a pitch down moment as well as an increase in thrust. In our opinion it would be useful to have during stall. However, the controllability during and after the stall would not strictly be affected by this, only the ability to recover from the stall. If you interpret the question slightly differently, then this could be considered correct, but we would say it is not quite correct. \"Position of horizontal stabiliser, e.g. a T-tail makes it harder to recover from a stall.\" As discussed above, this makes a huge difference to stall controllability, especially due to the ability of a T-tail design to go into a \"deep stall\". \"Supercritical wings increase nose up tendency in a stall.\" Supercritical wings do stall slightly differently (much faster and less gradual), but this does not really relate to a nose up tendency. Also, this option does not really answer the question above, so it is incorrect. \"Using roll spoilers increases the chance of aileron reversal near the stall.\" This one filled in incomplete feedback. Do not expect it in the exam. Aileron reversal (low speed) can happen if an aileron drops near the stall, increasing the AoA passed the stalling AoA and causing a reversal of the requested turn direction.",

DEEP STALL A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. T-tail aircraft are most likely to have deep stall characteristics. When the main wing stalls, the stabilizer becomes ineffective because it is situated in the separated turbulent flow of the wing and sometimes the fuselage. This can lead to a very dangerous scenario where the aircraft can sit stable in the deep stall, with no control surface left working to get out of the situation. A common way to prevent deep stall in these types of aircraft is a stick pusher device, which detects high angles of attack, approaching the stall, and instead of notifying the pilots of this (a stick shaker, stall warner, etc.), it actually pushes the stick forwards without any pilot intervention.",

A windshear encounter is a very dynamic event which can strike suddenly and with devastating effect which has been beyond the recovery powers of experienced pilots flying modern and powerful aircraft. The first and most vital defence is avoidance. AWARENESS AND AVOIDANCE Awareness of the weather conditions that cause windshear will reduce the risk of an encounter. If a windshear encounter is likely, the takeoff or landing should be delayed until the conditions improve, e.g. until a thunderstorm has moved away from the airport. Windshear represents a severe threat to aviation safety, the best option is to avoid it whenever possible. Nevertheless, in the case of an actual encounter with windshear, it is essential to be to quickly recognize it and then recover from it. PREVENTION A key element of adverse weather avoidance strategies is the active monitoring of the overall meteorological situation by the crew, in addition to the optimum use of the weather radar and correct understanding of the information displayed. The take-off, initial climb, final approach and landing phases of flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms may present the pilot with additional problems because of the airplane‘s proximity to the ground. To maintain a safe flight path in these phases can be very difficult. Do not take off if a thunderstorm is overhead or approaching. At destination, hold if a thunderstorm is overhead or approaching or divert if necessary. On the approach, if there is ever any doubt that you can regain a reasonable rate of descent, and land without abnormal manoeuvres, you should apply full power and go-around or make a missed approach. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Delay the approach, and divert if necessary. CORRECT: As the explanation suggests, in case of thunderstorm activity, the first mitigating action should be to avoid and therefore delay take-off/landing or divert if necessary. 2. Plan a flapless approach and landing. INCORRECT: Flaps/slats should be used for every normal approach, including those with thunderstorms present as they lower the stall speed and in the case of slats increase the critical angle of attack. 3. Maintain a speed at least 30 kt above normal approach speed. INCORRECT: Choosing to fly at a speed slightly higher than normal approach speed is a good technique to aid with speed fluctuations characteristic of thunderstorm activity. However, this would be type specific, and there is no general rule for an approach to be flown 30 knots faster than normal. 4. Delay landing flap selection until 200 ft. INCORRECT: Delaying the configuration of the aircraft is not a recommended for this type of approach, specially to as low as 200 ft. 5. Expect and prepare for a windshear warning and a go-around. CORRECT: As stated above, the first mitigating action should be to avoid the thunderstorms. On the approach, if avoiding is not possible, the crew should be prepared to perform a go-around.",

The HOT begins whenever the anti-icing stage begins, in single stage de/anti-icing, that is the beginning of the first stage, for 2 stage de/anti-icing, that is the beginning of the second stage. The responsibility regarding HOT and subsequent re-application of de-ice/anti-ice (if applicable) rests with the Commander from the time he has received the final report about the treatment from the Anti/De-icing person in charge.

Above that altitude any turbulence may induce Mach buffet, which could cause the airplane to exceed the maximum permitted load factor. The airflow behind a shockwave is turbulent and can cause a rapid vibrating movement of the horizontal stabilizer surfaces and is often referred to as the ‘shock stall’ and is the primary cause of high-speed buffet. A secondary cause of the rapid movement of the control surfaces, especially with supercritical airfoil sections, is when the wing reaches a speed of MCRIT the relatively weak shockwave that forms moves rapidly backward and forward over the surface of the wing producing similar indications to those of the shock stall.",

Indications of a full stall are typically that an uncommanded nose-down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and this may be accompanied by an uncommanded rolling motion.

This characteristic of the air is its viscosity, which although very small, is enough for the molecules of the air in contact with a surface to stick to the surface. It is static and therefore causes the laminar streamline flow adjacent to this layer to slow down, which in turn produces turbulence. The speed of the airflow changes from zero at the surface of the airfoil to the full speed of the free flow airstream a few millimeters away from the surface. This thin layer of sluggish air that clings to the surface of the object and in which the speed change of the airflow takes place is the boundary layer. In aerodynamics the boundary layer is important when considering wing stall, skin friction drag and heat transfer in high-speed flight. Boundary layers may be laminar (layered) or turbulent (disordered). The boundary layer increases in thickness as it moves rearward over an aircraft wing, with the turbulent boundary layer being proportionally thicker than the laminar boundary layer under the same free stream velocity conditions. The turbulent boundary layer has much higher local velocities immediately adjacent to the surface. The airflow in this region therefore possesses much higher kinetic energy than the laminar boundary layer at the same distance above the surface. The rapid velocity change associated with the turbulent boundary layer is evidence of high skin friction drag. The turbulent boundary has less tendency to separate from the airfoil surface over which it is flowing than the laminar boundary layer because it is better able to withstand the positive pressure gradient.",

Now since we can assume that there is no shift in centre of gravity because it would require shift in cargo, its safe to say the correct answer is a forward movement of the centre of pressure. Secondly, this question can also be answered by knowing that swept wings (assuming no change in angle of incidence of the profile from the root to the tip of the wing) are known to stall at the tips first. A stalled tip means a reduction in lift at the back of the wing (as the tips are fearthest towards the rear) and therefore a pitch up tendency.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

As you enter the vortex ring, you experience turbulence and a rapid increase in IAS as you pick up a headwind. You start to climb as your performance increases. 2. As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft. 3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed.

The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. The margin between the two types of stall narrows with increasing altitude. Notably the true airspeed of the low-speed stall increases with increasing altitude for a given indicated airspeed, whilst the true airspeed of the shock stall reduces up to the base of the tropopause, above which it remains constant. The point at which the two stalls coincide is referred to as the 'coffin corner'. The altitude at which an aircraft can fly at one airspeed in a 1g maneuver is called the aerodynamic ceiling. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3g will initiate the buffet onset.",

Please let us know if you see it in your exam, and which exam that is, thank you! TAILPLANE STALL Whilst it is not immediately identifiable by the question, this is asking about tailplane stalls due to icing. The tailplane (or horizontal stabiliser) is a second wing mounted at the rear of the aircraft to allow for stability, and for control (with the elevator), and in fact, is usually used to provide downwards lift to keep the aircraft's nose up, and counteract the weight/lift couple (which pushes the nose down). The tailplane is often quite a lot thinner than the main wing, so it builds up ice quicker, and means that tailplane stall due to icing can occur when there is little to no main wing ice accretion. A tailplane stall is made worse by the extension of flaps, as they increase the downwash from the main wing, which causes a larger negative angle of attack on the tailplane, which is more likely to stall the tailplane. Flaps also move the centre of pressure further back, which increases the Cg/Cp (Weight/Lift) couple, which means the elevator needs to create more downforce to keep the nose up. As the downforce from the tail decreases due to tail stall, there is a strong nose-down moment created. This is made worse - as mentioned above - by the use of flaps. The worst speed/configuration for this type of stall is just under the maximum flap speed (VFE), with flaps extended.",

When swept wings are unmodified, they have a strong tendency to stall first near the tips. Loss of lift at the tips moves the CP forward, giving a nose-up pitching moment as the lift is being produce from further forwards. This tendency to tip stall is due to the induced spanwise flow of the boundary layer from root to tip. During a tip stall, all the lift production is concentrated inboard and the maximum downwash now impacts the tail plane, adding to the nose-up pitching moment. As soon as a swept wing begins to stall, both forward CP movement and increased downwash at the tail plane cause the aircraft nose to rise rapidly, further increasing the angle of attack. This is a very undesirable and unacceptable response at the stall and can result in complete loss of control in pitch from which it may be very difficult, or even impossible, to recover. This is a very dangerous characteristic of many high speed, swept wing aircraft. For this reason, commercial swept wing aircraft are fitted with modifications to ensure the root stalls first. These can be vortex generators, or washout of the wing to reduce the tip angle of incidence, etc.",

This can lead to efficiencies in terms of lift distribution and induced drag, but when they are unmodified, produce less than ideal stalling characteristics. Wings on large aircraft are usually tapered and swept back, but here we are talking of unswept wings only. Tapered wings are prone to stalling first near the wing tips, and this stall spreads out forwards and inwards towards the root. This is undesireable as the stall affects the ailerons first, and makes this planform very susceptible to a violent wing drop. The first sign of stall on these aeroplanes often comes as a buffet through the ailerons, starting light and getting heavier, until the ailerons are fully stalled and have either a reverse effect or very little effect on aircraft control. Given where the stall occurs, and the likelihood of an early wing drop, elevator buffet is unlikely and pitching moments are quite limited. There is sometimes a pitch down moment due to the Centre of Pressure moving rearwards during the stall, but it is often not enough to avoid the formation of a spin. Hence, these aircraft wing planforms are usually modified in some way to avoid tip stalls and encourage the wing roots to stall first.",

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that decreasing load factor (push-over maneuver) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that increasing weight (mass) decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

A push-over manoeuvre is where the pilot pushes the controls forward and the load factor is reduced (usually to around zero G, but the manoeuvre is whenever the load factor is temporarily pushed below 1G). It is highly useful for reducing the load on the wings, and can break a stall immediately, as an aircraft cannot stall when the load factor is zero, allowing control to be regained temporarily to allow the aircraft to be stabilised and the airspeed to be increased. The angle of attack is reduced during a push-over manoeuvre, and this is a key part of unloading the wings.",

Load Factor = Lift / Weight LOAD FACTOR IN A TURN When an aircraft is in a banked turn, lift must be increased so as to maintain the vertical component of lift equal to weight. Load Factor (n) increases with bank angle at an increasing rate. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. This relationship may be expressed as: Load Factor (n) = 1 / cos φ Where φ = bank angle In a turn, load factor is a function ONLY of bank angle. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given airspeed is inversly proportional to the bank angle. Which means that decreasing the bank angle results in a radius of turn that greater. RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

A clean wing has a lower value of CLMAX, causing the Angle of Attack for a clean wing to be lower than for a wing with slats extended. A wing with flaps extended has the lowest value of CLMAX. In straight and level flight, prior to the stall, lift remains constant. Speed decreases and CL increases. In the stall (so after CLMAX has passed) the CL decreases again and speed is still low. Therefore lift decreases. The increased turbulent flow over the wing during the stall, the drag will be increased during the stall compared to the flight prior to the stall.",

However, at a certain AOA, the smooth flow of air over the wings is disrupted, and the airflow separates from the wing's surface. This leads to a sudden loss of lift, which is known as a stall. Option a) \"maximum continuous thrust is required to remain in level flight.\" is not correct because the need for maximum continuous thrust to maintain level flight is not necessarily an indication of a stall. Option b) \"control effectiveness reduces, such that large deflection is needed to maintain wings level.\" is also not correct because while control effectiveness may reduce as the AOA increases, it is not a definitive indicator of a stall. Option c) \"the coefficient of lift decreases with increased angle of attack.\" is a true statement about the coefficient of lift, but it does not necessarily indicate a stall. Option d) \"buffet is so strong that it deters the pilot from further speed reduction.\" is the correct answer because when an airplane approaches a stall, the airflow over the wings becomes turbulent, which can cause buffeting or vibration of the aircraft. If the buffeting is strong enough, it can deter the pilot from further reducing the speed, as it is an indication that the airplane is approaching a stall.

Lift is inclined from the vertical by the bank angle φ of 45° and must be increased in order to balance the weight and produce a force to perform the turn. More lift compared to the same weight increases the load factor n. Influence of the Load Factor (n) on Stall Speed VS = VS1G x √ n Because the load factor (n) increases in a turn, stall speed will increase accordingly. An accelerated stall is caused by abrupt or excessive control movements inducing an increased load factor. An accelerated stall can occur during a sudden change in the flight path, during manoeuvres such as steep turns or a recovery from a descent. It is called an accelerated stall because it occurs at a load factor greater than 1g. The stall is more violent than a 1g stall and is often unexpected because of the relatively high airspeed.",

In descent the formula will become T= D – W sin(alfa) The load factor is the relationship between lift and weight. As the lift in a stall is decreased and the load factor in straight and level flight is 1, the load factor will now be less than 1. The steeper the climb-/descent angle, the lower the load factor.

During a skid, the aircraft is turning too fast for the bank angle, and yaws into the turn. (Most likely, you're pushing too much rudder and causing the skid.) That causes the outside wing to move faster, increasing its lift, and causing the aircraft to roll into the turn. You compensate by adding opposite aileron - increasing the angle of attack on the inside, low wing. As the inside wing exceeds the critical angle of attack, it stalls and drops. The downward deflected aileron on the low wing is still generating drag, which pulls the aircraft's nose further into the turn. And, the aircraft is still yawing into the turn from the rudder, which accelerates the roll. The result is a quick roll into the turn, and your entry into an incipient spin => In a skidding spin, the low/inside wing stalls first, which rolls the plane into the turn, flipping it \"inside\" or \"underneath\".",

            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

This speed is Mmo most of the time, sometimes it is slightly below. These speeds come closer together as altitude increases. At a certain altitude the aircraft can encounter the so called “Coffin corner”. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are very close together here, and thus it is easy to stall or hit Mmo. The coffin corner is a dangerous situation and is supposed to be avoided, as a slight amount of turbulence could cause the aircraft to stall. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor.

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is correct. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

This is particularly dangerous in modes such as level change or flight level change, which maintain a constant airspeed/Mach No. in the climb, as the aircraft would pitch up more and more to try to reduce the \"increasing airspeed\", stalling the aircraft quite quickly. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

If the wings have been mounted with different angles of incidence, then they will constantly be at a different angles of attack. The wing with the higher angle of incidence will always be at a higher angle of attack. Whilst this could be quite noticeable in normal flight, it would likely be most noticeable at or near the stall speed, where the wing with a slightly higher angle of attack will be the one to stall first, but whilst the other wing is still producing a lot of lift. This would cause a violent wing drop towards the side of the stalled wing. This theory is used on some wings to make sure that the wing root stalls first, by twisting the wing to give the root a higher angle of incidence than the wing tip. This is called \"washout\".",

This causes the boundary layer to separate behind the shock wave, leading to a loss of lift and reduction in the lift coefficient (CL) (shock stall). The shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value for a given angle of attack. Wings not specifically designed for high speeds may experience significant lift loss at speeds above MCRIT. However, wings designed for high-speed flight, incorporating features like sweepback, thinner sections, and reduced camber, exhibit much less variation in lift throughout the transonic region. Sweeping the wing back is a widely employed method to increase MCRIT, the critical Mach number. By employing a swept wing, the free stream velocity is effectively divided into two components: one perpendicular to the leading edge and the other parallel to it. The component perpendicular to the leading edge is less than the free stream velocity and it is this velocity component which determines the magnitude of the pressure distribution and hence MCRIT. Due to this reduced velocity component affecting the pressure distribution, MCRIT increases. Furthermore, on wings with low thickness to chord ratios, the airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface is diminished. Consequently, the value of MCRIT is raised on such wings.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.80 to the FL400 curve. From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor to asset the limiting weight. In this case, the limiting weight is 110 tons.",

STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d. Unresponsive flight controls.",

The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

This decreases the angle of attack at the tip, and the root will tend to stall first, which is desirable. The aerofoil section may be varied throughout the span such that sections with greater thickness and camber are located near the tip.

High temperatures cause low pressure, The main feature of the ITCZ is extensive Cu, Cb, and thunderstorms. The cloud tops are sometimes as low as 20,000 ft but more frequently 50,000 ft or more. Turbulence is usually severe, as is icing, which can be from 16,000 ft upwards. Buffet Onset Chart In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. The ‘Buffet Onset’ chart is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. Turbulence Penetration Speed For flight in turbulence an airspeed must be chosen to give margin against stalling and overstressing the aircraft structure. This speed is VRA/MRA (the rough-air speed) or turbulence penetration speed. VRA/MRA will give adequate protection from over-stressing the aircraft with maximum protection from an inadvertent stall. In conclusion, clear air turbulence (CAT) can be caused by jetstreams, Cb’s, mountain waves, etc. with the same consequences as the ITCZ or jetstreams. Thunderstorms should be circumnavigated and preferably upwind. Extensive use of weather radar scanning is useful. A turbulence penetration speed should be selected to minimise the gust loads on the aircraft. When possible, descent to a lower altitude should be considered as it gives more performance and buffet margin to cope with gusts.",

The pressure distribution over the front of the wing is, however, altered, which varies the position of the wing’s center of pressure and its overall pitching moment. This alters the wing’s angle of attack and results in rapid backward and forward movements of the shock waves. A kind of instability is set up, and the rapid changes in the pressure distribution result in vibration of the whole aircraft. This is primarily due to the distributed airflow behind the shock wave hitting the tail plane. If shock waves form on the control surfaces, it will also affect the stick forces by altering their hinge moments.",

The turn radius is dependent solely on the TAS for a given bank angle. To reduce the turn radius along flight path 3, the TAS can be decreased while maintaining the bank angle, or the bank angle can be increased while keeping the TAS constant. \"bank 30 and pull back on stick\" This option is partially correct. By increasing the bank angle, the turn radius will reduce. If we increase the bank angle, a pull force on the stick will be required to maintain the same altitude. However, if no action is taken to maintain the airspeed, it will decrease and may lead to a stall. \"bank 25 degrees to maintain a margin but increase speed to increase the rate of turn\" This option is incorrect. Maintaining the same bank angle while increasing speed will actually increase the turn radius.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

            "explanation": "Static longitudinal stability depends upon the relationship between angle of attack (α) and pitching moment coefficient (CM). Consideration must be given to the pitching moment contribution of each aircraft component. The pitching moment coefficients contributed by all the various components of the aircraft are summed and plotted versus lift coefficient (angle of attack). Figure 1, shows the variation of pitching moment coefficient (CM) with lift coefficient (CL) for an aircraft with positive static longitudinal stability. Static stability is shown by a return to equilibrium, or trim, upon displacement. The aeroplane described by graph A is in trim or equilibrium when CM = 0. If the aeroplane is disturbed to some different CL, the pitching moment change tends to return the aircraft to the point of trim. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some higher CL (point y), a negative or nose-down pitching moment is produced which tends to decrease angle of attack back to the trim point. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some lower CL (point x), a positive or nose-up pitching moment is developed which tends to increase the angle of attack back to the trim point. Positive static longitudinal stability is indicated by a negative slope of CM versus CL. The degree of static longitudinal stability is indicated by the slope of the curve. Effect of Wing and Tail Position (figure 2) When the aerodynamic stability of a configuration is looked at, power effects are ignored and the stability is considered by a build-up of the contributing components. If the CG is set at 30 ̊ percent MAC, the contribution of the wing alone is destabilising, as indicated by the positive slope of CM versus CL. The combination of the wing and fuselage increases the instability. The contribution of the tail alone is highly stabilising from the large negative slope of the curve. By moving the tail aft (increasing the distance to the CG) and increasing its area both contribute to the stabilising moment, which means that the slope will be steeper, making this the correct answer.",

An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Dynamic stability, on the other hand, covers what happens after this. An aircraft can only have any measurement of dynamic stability if it is first statically stable. If an aircraft is then dynamically stable, the oscillations will gradually reduce until the aircraft is back at equilibrium. Neutral dynamic stability will mean the aircraft continues to oscillate either side of equilibrium by the same amount (no damping). Dynamic instability (negative dynamic stability) means the aircraft oscillations get larger in magnitude each time. For this question, it is very important to note that any form of dynamic stability (or instability) can only come if the aircraft first has positive static stability. Without first going towards the equilibrium point, there are no oscillations to either shrink or grow. This means there is only one possible correct answer.",

When moving forward, the c.g will cause either a reduced positive lift created by the horizontal stabilizer, or an increase in negative lift. This is dependant on whether the c.g is located in front or behind the centre of pressure. Due to the decrease in positive lift or increase in negative lift of the tail, the main wing will have to compensate and produce more lift. Therefore a forward c.g will cause a higher value of wing lift. Secondly, on the right side of the figure, we can see the effect of a decrease in thrust on the aircraft at high angle of attack (slow speed flight). At high AoA the thrust will have a strong vertical component, therefore a high thrust will help lift the aircraft up and reduce the lift required. This is opposite when the thrust is reduced at high AoA, then the wings will have to compensate and create more lift to remain in level flight.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: We believe that \"greater than\" is the correct answer here (and most recent feedback seems to agree), but we have varying feedback about the correct answer over the past few months. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, thanks. Also please note that this is a very different question to 811457, as many people (understandably) have connected the two. This question is about stick force stability, the force required to hold a different airspeed, whereas 811457 is about stick force per G, the force required to pull a particular G-force, so they are very different. Figure 1 indicates the variation of stick force with airspeed and illustrates the effect of tab setting on stick force. You can see from the graph, that dependent on EAS (Equivalent Air Speed) and trim tab setting, the stick force to hold a 1 kt change in airspeed from the trimmed speed DECREASES as the trimmed speed increases. There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Therefore, holding a 5 kt difference from 70 kts would required a greater force than holding a 5 kt difference from 100 kt. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft that has positive stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed (it is a bit more nuanced than this, but this is all we need to know here). The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (i.e. a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. The neutral point is the place on an aeroplane that the CG must be in front of to make the aircraft stable in a particular axis. Its location is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin. The larger the static margin, the greater the stability, (and lower the manoeuvrability).

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime.

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack.

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient.

            "explanation": "Centre of Pressure (CP) is considered as the point at which lift acts through, while Centre of Gravity (CG) is the point where weight of aircraft acts through. Refer to the situation 1 in diagram: The moments have to be balanced for straight and level flight. Since the CG is forward of CP, lift (L) is producing an anticlockwise moment around the CG. To balance this anticlockwise moment from lift, we need a clockwise moment from the force of the stabiliser (F). To procedure a clockwise moment from the stabiliser, a downward force will be needed. If we take moment at the point of CG, we can establish the formula Lx=F(x+y). With rearrangement we can see that F = Lx / ( x + y) Refer to situation 2 in diagram: Now if the distance between CG and CP becomes larger than before, the new formula will become Wz + Lx = F'(x+y), if we take moment at the original GC position and F’ is the new force required from the stabiliser. With rearrangement, F’ = (Wz + Lx) / (x + y). If we compare F and F’, we can see that they share the same denominator while F’ has a larger numerator (Wz + Lx > Lx), with all parameters positive real numbers). Therefore, F’ is larger than F, which means as the distance between CG and CP becomes greater, the downward balancing force of the stabiliser becomes greater as well. (In this case) Another way to visualise the situation is to plug in some convenient numbers. If lift, distance x and y are all 1, F will be 1/(1+1) = 0.5 originally (taking moment at the CG). Now, let’s say the x is increased to 2, with other parameters unchanged. Taking moment at the new CG, F’ will be 2/(2+1) = 0.67, which is larger than 0.5 previously. Notes for further learning: This question assumes lift does not change when the distance between CG and CP increases. As the force from stabiliser becomes greater, the weight will have to be reduced in order to balance the upward and downward forces in this case.",

If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

A dorsal fin is a small aero foil, of very low aspect ratio, mounted on top of the fuselage near the rear. A ventral fin is mounted below. If the aircraft is yawed to the right, the dorsal and ventral fins will create a side force to the right. The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service. While dorsal and ventral fins contribute positively to directional static stability, a dorsal fin contributes positively to lateral static stability, while a ventral fin is destabilizing in this mode and has no effect on longitudinal stability.",

To trim the airplane for higher speeds corresponding to points (2) and (3), less and less aircraft nose-up tab is required. Note that when the airplane is properly trimmed, a push force is required to increase airspeed and a pull force is required to decrease airspeed. In this manner, the airplane would have positive stick force stability with a stable “feel” for airspeed. Irrespective of the speed or the deflection of the elevators, by modifying the forces acting on the control column such that a greater pull and push force is necessary, stick-force stability is obtained. There are two devices that achieve this aim, they are the down spring (figure 2) and the bobweight (figure 3).

As long as the gradient of the graph is negative, whenever the aircraft has a nose-up disturbance, the AoA will decrease to correct for this, and vice versa.

The line is not usually straight, it changes gradient due to the aircraft's design and window of stability. The CM vs alpha graph is affected by various things in the aircraft's design, including the locations of the wings and the shape of aerofoils, size of wings, etc. The CG location also massively affects the CM vs alpha graph, of course. The question is terribly worded, but really we only have to be able to say which factors a pilot can change in flight, and make sure that they actually do affect stability, and the CM vs alpha graph. Whilst the question is terrible, the answer isn't too bad. \"The centre of pressure, by changing the flap setting.\" Yes, the centre of pressure is one of the key factors determining the CM and it can be changed by changing flap setting, which is something we can do in the air. This would likely change the CM vs alpha graph completely. \"The neutral point, by varying alpha.\" The neutral point is a set location in the aircraft, determined by things such as the wing sizes and moment arms, and cannot be changed in flight. \"The centre of pressure, by varying alpha.\" Yes, again, the centre of pressure does affect the CM, and changing the angle of attack changes the CM and the gradient, strength of stability, etc., and is something that we can do in flight, of course. \"The centre of gravity, which influences the degree of pitching moment.\" This is where the question gets a bit more difficult. We are assuming that the pilot cannot change the CG during flight, but of course, some aircraft have trim tanks for that possibility, and we know that fuel burn does alter the CG, but not in a way the pilot can meaningfully control. The second part, the \"degree of pitching moment\" is also incredibly vague, and given the vague question, we agree that this option is incorrect.",

An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Now, let's differentiate between two essential concepts: Controllability: This refers to the pilot's ability to control the aircraft using inputs. It involves the pilot's capacity to guide the airplane effectively. Manoeuvrability: This relates to the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various maneuvers. CS-23 and CS-25 are certification requirements that establish standards for aircraft design and performance. These regulations mandate that an airplane must exhibit static stability and meet specific criteria for controllability and manoeuvrability. In general, an aircraft with static stability is easier to control, and its movements are more predictable. The connection between manoeuvrability and stability is such that as an aircraft's static stability increases, an aircraft equipped with a particular size of control surfaces may experience a slight reduction in manoeuvrability. This is because static stability characterizes the aircraft's capacity to reestablish its initial position following a disturbance. In essence, a statically stable aircraft tends to oppose alterations in its attitude, which can introduce increased challenges when manoeuvring, especially in specific situations.",

The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability.

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. We see that line 3 starts off as having static longitudinal stability, as the line moves downward at first. This means that for a higher Angle of attack, a pitch down moment is induced. Towards the middle of this line, we see that the line flattens out, reducing static longitudinal stability at higher angles of attack.",

Drag increase encountered at these higher speeds is called wave drag. At and above MCRIT, the drag of the airplane wing increases rapidly and there is a large reduction of lift. If the shockwave develops earlier on wing than the other (assymetrically), the wing drops and tends to yaw creating the conditions for a coupled lateral and directional oscillation or Dutch roll.

Dutch roll is an oscillatory instability associated with swept-wing jet aircraft. It is the combination of yawing and rolling motions. When the aircraft yaws, it will develop into a roll. The yaw itself is not too significant, but the roll is much more noticeable and unstable. This is so because the aircraft suffers from a continuous reversing rolling action. Dutch roll occurs when static lateral stability is strong and static directional stability is relatively weak. Yaw dampers prevent Dutch roll on swept-wing aircraft. Dutch roll is most common at high speed and high altitude. At high altitude and high Mach number, aerodynamic damping decreases. Decreasing both altitude and Mach number should increase damping and stop the oscillation.",

This means that the stick force per g must have upper and lower limits to ensure that the airplane always has acceptable control characteristics. Stick force per G is affected by factors such as the aircraft CG, airspeed, altitude. When the pilots make an input on the controls, lets say the elevators for example, this puts a pitch moment on the aircraft, which the aircraft's natural stability fights against, this is a part of what's called \"aerodynamic damping\". At high altitudes, the high TAS reduces the change in tail angle of attack for a given pitching velocity and reduces the aerodynamic pitch damping. Thus, the aircraft becomes more manoeuvrable and less stable. This means that the stick force per G decreases (a 1G increase in load factor is easier to pull through the control column). It is also worth noting for real life flying that this makes hand-flying much more difficult at high altitudes, as very small movements are required but still produce large changes to attitude.",

It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is normally heavily damped. It not only involves small changes of speed and height but also large changes of load factor. The speed and height of the airplane remain approximately constant.",

We do not know whether this question is currently being asked, and we very much hope that it has been removed. Please send us any further questions or exam feedback in the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The feel of an aeroplane is how much force is required to make a particular manoeuvre, often referred to in the units of \"stick force per G\" for longitudinal stability (pitch changes). Stability and manoeuvrability are intrinsically linked, in that the more manoeuvrable an aircraft is, the less stable it is, and vice-versa. Stick force per G simply measures how much force the pilot needs to exert on the controls to cause a 1G change in load factor, the higher this value, the more stable (less controllable) an aircraft is. The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability, as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. A change in mass (without a change in CG) is much more complicated. It appears that mass change has an effect on the manoeuvrability that cannot be simply stated for the average aircraft, as mass and wing loading (a function of mass) appear to have opposing effects, but with different values, and the effect of different speeds for higher masses is not accounted for anywhere in the question. As you can probably tell, this is already much too complex for the ATPL exams. This is likely why the effect of mass on manoeuvring stability/stick force per G is not on the learning objectives. It is intuitive to think that a lighter aircraft is more manoeuvrable, but that is not something that can be absolutely stated without further information, and not even something the learning objectives mention. We think that the examiner has written a question to test knowledge of CG movements, assuming that their intuition on the change in weight is correct, but has ended up making a question much more complicated, which ventures outside the learning objectives. Therefore, our new recommendation here would be to answer the question assuming that the weight reduction decreases the stick force per G, even though that is not an absolute statement. This leaves us with the answer \"The stick force per g is reduced since the aeroplane is lighter, but the forward CG makes this reduction less noticeable to the pilot.\"",

            "explanation": "The lateral static stability is a measure of the airplane’s tendency to return to the wings-level attitude after a disturbance has caused the airplane to be disturbed in the rolling plane. Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, though, if the aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then the aircraft will start to roll more wings level, decreasing the rate of turn when they release the controls, decreasing the airspeed and starting to loosen the spiral, so all these parameters decrease.",

            "explanation": "This is a very complex question, but the answer is the simplest one present. The examiner has put in a lot to try and confuse you. The answer to the question is right at the top, but keep reading if you want to know more and if you want to know why the other answers are incorrect. Directional stability (stability in yaw) and lateral stability (stability in roll) are very well linked. The linkage between the two is via sideslip, the condition where the aircraft is not pointing in the same direction it is travelling through the air, so the relative airflow is arriving from one side of the nose, rather than straight on the nose. We can cause this by not flying the aircraft properly, and by flying uncoordinated, so using the ailerons without also using correct rudder, and vice-versa. LATERAL/DIRECTIONAL STABILITY Imagine that we have a left sideslip, so the aircraft is pointing forwards, but travelling to the left of that, and the relative airflow is hitting the left windshield first. A directionally stable aircraft will naturally yaw into this (nose left moment), because of the positively stable effect of the fin (vertical stabiliser), any rear strakes or ventral fin, the differential drag of the wings, etc. A laterally stable aircraft will roll away from this sideslip (right bank moment), due to the dihedral effect, sweepback, high wing effect, etc. Both of these movements decreases the sideslip, just in different ways; the aircraft can either yaw into it, or roll away from it. Most civilian aircraft are both laterally and directionally stable at once, in equal measure. If the stability becomes too high on one or the other, then it can cause either Dutch Roll or Spiral Instability. DUTCH ROLL Too much lateral stability and not enough directional stability can cause a periodic motion of sideslip and overcorrection which we call Dutch Roll. Imagine an aircraft with very long, dihedral wings, but a small tail fin. SPIRAL INSTABILITY The opposite of Dutch Roll, Spiral Instability is where we have too much directional stability but not enough lateral stability, which causes an increasing bank angle, with the aircraft constantly yawing further to keep the turn coordinated and ending up in a spiral dive. It is an aperiodic motion (it only happens once, not back and forth). Imagine a large tail fin and short, non-dihedral wings. So in terms of this question, we have already seen the correct answer, \"Lateral and directional stabilities interact through sideslip, which is created when using either aileron or rudder alone.\". Whilst there are other ways to create sideslip, this is a very common one. For two other options, we should mention that the rudder and ailerons are not contributors to stability. They are control surfaces, and the pilot has direct control over them. Stability has to be natural within the aircraft. If it takes a pilot to remove the sideslip, then the aircraft is not that stable. In a stable aircraft, we manipulate the ailerons and rudder against the natural stability of the aircraft design. For the final option remaining, most aircraft would enter a spiral dive under the conditions mentioned in the question (depending on the extent of the deflection). However, with stronger lateral stability, the aircraft would be able to resist the spiral dive. Extra directional stability would just make a spiral dive easier to enter. So you could say that lateral stability is too weak, but not both lateral and directional stabilities.",

Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. For this specific question, we can see that line 1 is the most longitudinally unstable aircraft and line 4 is the most longitudinally stable aircraft. With this information we can derive that the CG position is further aft at line 1 compared to line 4.",

For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment: - The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by an arm (distance from wing CP to CG). - The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm (distance from tailplane CP to CG). The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG directly affects the magnitude of the longitudinal static stability, the tailplane downforce and the stalling speed because its position determines the length of the arm of any restoring moment. A forward movement of the CG increases the positive longitudinal static stability of an aircraft but decreases the manoeuvrability and control response because the moment arm is increased in length and increases the nose-down pitching moment. Thus, the required downforce on the tailplane increases.",

With high stability comes low manoeuvrability (think large jet aircraft) and with low stability comes high manoeuvrability (fighter jets or aerobatic display aircraft). The placement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the effect of any movement affects the tailplane more than the main wing and the rest of the aircraft, and it has a greater stabilising effect (like the fins on a dart). The \"neutral point\" is the where the CG would be for the aircraft to have NEUTRAL static stability (in pitch). If the CG is in front of the neutral point, the aircraft is statically stable in pitch. The further forwards the CG goes, the more stable the aircraft gets. The location of the neutral point is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin.

If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’. Shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. As the shock wave moves aft over the surface of the wing, the CP also moves aft. This aft movement combined with the reduced downwash at the tail plane due to the presence of the shockwave will lead to Tuck Under. As we can see, from all the options, shock stall, mach buffet and tuck under only occur when operating above MCRIT (transonic speed regime).

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

The character of spiral divergence is not violent. When a small sideslip is introduced, the strong directional stability tends to restore the nose into the wind while the relatively weak “dihedral effect” lags in restoring the aeroplane laterally. The rate of divergence in the spiral motion is usually so gradual that the pilot can control the tendency without difficulty. Spiral instability is normally considered less objectionable than oscillatory instability, so most aircraft are designed to be spirally unstable. With this characteristic, when the aircraft is yawed, either by the prolonged application of rudder or asymmetric power, a rolling moment in the direction of yaw occurs and the aircraft quickly enters a spiral dive. This can occur when flying at low airspeeds under asymmetric power conditions, when excessive yaw due to too much power is coupled with insufficient rudder control to balance it, and may quickly place an aircraft in a dangerous attitude.",

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Noticeable changes in static stability can occur at high lift coefficients (low speed). This condition is The curve of CM versus CL of this illustration shows a good stable slope at low values of CL (high speed). Increasing CL gives a slight decrease in the negative slope hence a decrease in stability occurs. With continued increase in CL, the slope becomes zero and neutral stability exists. Eventually, the slope becomes positive and the airplane becomes unstable.",

The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). Directional stability is, consequently, increased. Dorsal fins are effectively an extension of the tail fin, so increase directional (yaw) and lateral (roll) stability, like the tail fin does. Ventral fins are still good for directional (yaw) stability, but as they go the opposite direction to the fin when the aircraft rolls, they are actually bad for lateral (roll) stability.",

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime. This is the range of speeds (At and above MCRIT) where some of the aircraft experiences supersonic airflow, but not all the aircraft does. This brings rise to shockwaves, first on the upper wing surfaces near the roots, then spreading to other areas of the aircraft. Shockwaves produce quite high drag forces, classed as \"wave drag\". If the shockwaves form asymmetrically on the aircraft, whether due to different airflow patterns over the wings, small differences in the aircraft structure, control surfaces, etc., then the different drag forces can cause a yawing motion, which sets off the oscillation known as Dutch roll. This Dutch roll would be made worse by the shockwaves forming on the faster wing, reducing lift and increasing drag to drop it down and drag it back, exacerbating the Dutch roll.",

The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. A CG position aft of this point would produce an unacceptably low value of maneuver stability and would make the airplane difficult to fly.

Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

            "explanation": "The most direct appreciation of the maneuvering stability of an airplane is obtained from a plot of stick force versus load factor. The airplane with positive maneuvering stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. This means that with a more aft CG, a smaller force is required to achieve a given load factor. If the CG is more aft than anticipated and a force is applied with the same magnitude, the limit load factor may be exceeded.",

Static Longitudinal stability is the aircraft's natural tendency when disturbed in pitch, to return to its former trimmed angle of attack without pilot input, and is desirable throughout the aircraft's complete speed range. For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment. The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by arm ‘x’. The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm ‘y’. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. If the nose-down (negative) tail moment is greater than the nose-up (positive) wing moment, the aircraft will have static longitudinal stability. NEUTRAL POINT If you consider the CG moving rearwards from a position of static longitudinal stability: - the tail arm ‘y’ will decrease and the wing arm ‘x’ will increase; - the (negative) tail moment will decrease and the (positive) wing moment will increase. Eventually the CG will reach a position at which the tail moment is the same as the wing moment. If a vertical gust displaces the aircraft nose-up, the sum of the moments will be zero and there will be no angular acceleration about the CG to return the aircraft towards its original position of equilibrium. Because there is no resultant moment, either nose-up or nose-down, the aircraft will remain in its new position of equilibrium; the aircraft will have neutral static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG when the sum of the changes in the tail moment and wing moment caused by the gust is zero is known as the neutral point.",

The sideslip angle (β) is the displacement aircraft centre-line from the relative airflow. By convention it is positive when the relative airflow is displaced to the right of the aircraft centre-line. The sideslip gives the symmetrical fin an angle of attack equal to the sideslip angle. This produces a small aerodynamic force, which, when multiplied by the distance from the centre of gravity, produces a strong restoring moment, and yaws the aircraft back to its original equilibrium position. A swept wing provides a stable contribution depending on the amount of sweepback, which increases with increase in CL (i.e. at lower IAS). This contribution is relatively weak when compared with other components. The inclination of the forward, right, wing to the relative airflow is greater than that of the rearward wing, so there is more lift and, hence, more induced drag, on the right side. The result of this discrepancy in drag on the two sides of the wing is a yawing moment to the right, which tends to eliminate the sideslip. This is a stabilizing effect, and may be important if the sweepback angle is quite large.",

Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying.",

There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft has stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed. The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

In an aircraft, it may be achieved manually, by an electrohydraulic system, or by aerodynamic means. This type of damping is dependent on the viscosity of the air for its success. The denser the atmosphere, the faster the unwanted movement will be extinguished When we make a control input, for instance a roll to the right, there is a resistance against this input due to \"aerodynamic damping\", which in this case, is where the down-going (right) wing gains an increased angle of attack as it is travelling down slightly, changing the relative airflow. This increases the lift slightly and resists the roll a little. This effect is influenced by air density, and in the low density of higher altitudes, the aircraft is travelling at a higher TAS, which means that the angle of attack change is smaller. This is a reduction in aerodynamic damping. All the control axes have natural aerodynamic damping in some form. which are reduced at high altitude. At an ISA altitude of 40 000 ft, aerodynamic damping would be reduced to one-half the ISA sea level value. High altitude, and consequently low density (high TAS), reduces aerodynamic damping, and therefore reduces dynamic stability on all axes.",

Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability. With a dominant lateral stability this will, when a yaw is introduced, roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into the wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. The CG position has little influence on the lateral stability, but an aft CG will reduce the directional stability because the Moment Arm of the stabilizing moment from the fin will decrease and thus increasing the likelihood of a Dutch roll. To reduce the aircraft tendency to Dutch roll, either the lateral stability should be decreased or the directional stability increased => anhedral would decrease the lateral stability. Aircraft with a tendency to Dutch roll are also fitted with yaw damper. This automatically displaces the rudder proportional to the rate of yaw to damp out the oscillation. Note: Dutch roll is a result of high Lateral stability with relatively low Directional stability. Furthermore, Longitudinal stability is not a factor.",

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient.

The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal and directional stability (stability in pitch and yaw movements), as the aircraft rotates around the CG, and the effect of the aircraft's aerodynamics act differently, depending on how far forward/backwards the CG is. We can think of stability like a dart, the further forward the mass, and the further backwards all the aerodynamic bits (the fins), the more stable an aircraft is. This is why a dart is very nose heavy. This shows us that the further forward the CG, the greater the stability. Each component has its own effect on aircraft stability, in each axis. So the fuselage's effect actually depends on the fuselage and CG position, but it usually destabilising, due to the large nose that sticks out ahead of the CG, but the tail fin (vertical stabiliser) is massively stabilising, because it is a large aerodynamic surface at the rear of the aircraft. Shifting the CG backwards makes the whole aircraft more tail heavy, which reduces the stability of every element of the aircraft, and reduces the overall stability in every axis except lateral (roll), therefore including directional (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch).",

Therefore, a roll to the right of is \"positive\" and to the left is \"negative\". Again, this is the same when the roll angle changes. Yaw is more difficult: as pilots we could refer to it in terms of heading (right is positive again here), but that would not be useful for aerodynamic calculations, so instead we use the sideslip angle. Sideslip angle (β) is the displacement angle of the airplane’s longitudinal axis in azimuth from the relative airflow. If the relative airflow comes from the right of the aircraft, that means a positive sideslip (+β), and if the relative airflow is from the left of the aircraft, that is negative sideslip (-β). The actual yawing moment (cn) of an aircraft is then considered a positive yawing moment (+cn) if it is to the right, or a negative yawing moment (-cn) if it is to the left.

By tilting the wingtips upwards, the aeroplane becomes naturally more stable in the lateral plane. This is called dihedral. Lift acts perpendicular to the relative airflow. If the aeroplane rolls to the side when disturbed by a gust of wind, the lift vector leans to the side with the aeroplane. This creates a resultant sideways facing force that makes the aeroplane side slip in the same direction. As a result of this side slip, the aeroplane is subjected to a sideways component of the relative airflow. Due to dihedral, the lower wing (into the wind) meets the upcoming airflow at a greater angle of attack than the upper wing. Consequently, the lower wing produces more lift and helps the aeroplane roll back to its original position. This is how dihedral improves lateral stability.",

It is the change to the stability of an airplane with the passage of time. Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

By tilting the wingtips upwards, the aeroplane becomes naturally more stable in the lateral plane. This is called dihedral. Lift acts perpendicular to the relative airflow. If the aeroplane rolls to the side when disturbed by a gust of wind, the lift vector leans to the side with the aeroplane. This creates a resultant sideways facing force that makes the aeroplane side slip in the same direction. As a result of this side slip, the aeroplane is subjected to a sideways component of the relative airflow. Due to dihedral, the lower wing (into the wind) meets the upcoming airflow at a greater angle of attack than the upper wing. Consequently, the lower wing produces more lift and helps the aeroplane roll back to its original position. This is how dihedral improves lateral stability.",

To add to that, the low wing increases in AR (Aspect Ratio), while the high wing decreases in AR. Both of these will increase the lift on the low wing, and restore the aircraft to level flight, hence the high static lateral stability of swept wing aircraft. We also know that if you increase the lift, you increase the drag. So, it will have a slight tendency to yaw into the relative airflow (as there is more drag on the low wing), thereby contributing to static directional stability. This is a very small factor compared to the directional stability provided by the vertical fin but it does contribute to it. So it is positive.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”.

The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment.

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability affects many aspects of its flight characteristics. For an aircraft to be considered statically stable, it must initially begin to return to its original position/orientation after some sort of displacement. Think of placing a ball in a bowl, it will always begin to roll back to the bottom of the bowl, the equilibrium point. An aircraft can have stability in all three axes, pitch (longitudinal stability), yaw (directional stability) and roll (lateral stability). The opposite of stability is manoeuvrability, and if the aircraft is very stable, it is not very manoeuvrable, and vice-versa. The less stable (more manoeuvrable) we make an aircraft, the more easily it will change orientation. This is why aerobatic aircraft have very light controls, meaning that even small stick forces will cause a large aircraft movement, whereas stable aircraft, such as transport jets, are very stable, and will require much larger stick movements, and more stick force, to provide the same amount of aircraft movement. This is called stick force stability, which is a measure of how much input force is required to cause a 1G change. This question is asking about stick displacement, but it is largely the same thing. It is the reason that you would not want to cruise a highly aerobatic aircraft for long distances, as the fineness of control is difficult to achieve when the controls are so light and tiny movements cause huge changes. To answer the question, if small movements of the stick create large pitch/roll changes, the aircraft must be highly manoeuvrable. Interestingly, modern fighter aircraft, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, are designed to be statically unstable for highest manoeuvrability, and have very responsive fly-by-wire controls making sure that the aircraft does not become unstable during flight. Excellent for air-to-air combat, terrible if they lose their FBW system.",

Another way to think of this is that on approach, the runway will be out of the right hand side window, even if there is no crosswind. Wing sweep will help increase lateral stability. When a swept-wing airplane is sideslipping, the wing toward the sideslip will experience a higher velocity normal to the wing's leading edge than the wing away from the sideslip. More lift is generated on the wing toward the sideslip and a roll moment arises that tends to diminish the bank angle or sideslip and return the airplane to equilibrium. In this case, the airflow over the right wing becomes straighter (less swept). Straighter wings are effectively longer, so produce more lift, resulting in a larger rolling moment to the left returning the aircraft to a non-sideslipped condition. This is an example of positive lateral stability.",

It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is normally heavily damped.

If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack.

The moments created about the normal-axis tend to turn the nose of the aircraft into or away from the relative wind. The aircraft has positive directional stability if the moments created by a sideslip angle tend to align the nose of the aircraft with the relative wind. If directional stability is excessive, high turn rate is provided by the moment. This can result in excessive back and forth (left – right) turning if the wind is coming from alternating left – right side. Thus, it will be difficult to control the aircraft in case of sideslip.

Learning Objective 081.04.04.05.01: Describe how the following aeroplane components contribute to static directional stability: wing; fin; dorsal fin; ventral fin; angle of sweep of the wing; angle of sweep of the fin; fuselage at high alpha; strakes. The vertical stabiliser (tail fin) of an aircraft is the main contributor to static directional stability (stability in yaw), as any sideslip angle will create a lift on the fin by introducing an angle of attack to its symmetrical aerofoil, which then will create a force on the aircraft to point into the relative airflow. From here on out, we are using the words, \"positive effect\" (on stability) to mean that it makes the aircraft more stable. The larger we make the tail fin, the larger the positive effect (on stability). Also, the further back we make the tail fin from the centre of gravity, the larger the moment arm of the force, so the larger the positive effect. For this question, we must remember that the fin is just a wing, but when we fly coordinated (no sideslip), it is a symmetrical aerofoil, so creating no lift in either direction. Introducing a sideslip (an angle of attack - AoA) causes a lift force to be made. The greater this force, the greater the \"positive effect\" on stability, which pushes the tail around so the nose points towards the relative airflow. Sweepback of a wing does a few things, it increases the MCRIT of the aerofoil by making it \"effectively thinner\", which is very useful for high speed flight. It also changes the low speed flying characteristics a lot, decreasing the coefficient of lift for each angle of attack, but increasing the critical (stalling) angle of attack (but with a lower maximum lift output). This last bit is particularly useful for aircraft. Swept back tail fins will remain useful at higher angles of sideslip before stalling, in comparison to straight fins. Increased sweepback of the tail fin usually has a negative effect on directional stability (stability in yaw). At low/medium sideslip angles, the reduced lift coefficient for each angle of attack produces less of a restoring force (the lower gradient on the graph above). It is important to note that at higher angles of attack, within a certain range, a straight fin will have stalled (so provides almost no stability) and the swept fin would not yet have stalled due to its higher stalling AoA, and in that case, the swept fin provides far more stabilising effect than a straight fin, but only within a certain range of large sideslip angles.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. If an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection, as the forces on the tailplane often are deflected downwards.",

The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. A CG position aft of this point would produce an unacceptably low value of maneuver stability and would make the airplane difficult to fly.

Dorsal fins are effectively just an extension to the main fin, extending forwards to provide some benefits such as the blending with the fuselage, reducing drag, providing better stability at high sideslip angles, etc. They therefore have a positive effect on directional and lateral stability. Ventral fins (sometimes called strakes), however, are placed under the fuselage, and provide a further increase in directional stability (yaw), but have the opposite effect to the main and dorsal fins when it comes to lateral stability, they are de-stabilising. Ventral fins are very useful for improving the stall/spin characteristcs of aircraft where the fuselage and wings may render the main fin less effective at high angles of attack (similar to a deep stall, but for stability). Their main limitation is ground clearance. None of these items have any effect on longitudinal stability, which is stability in pitch, as a pitch change will not cause any angle of attack change to these components. Some ventral fins/strakes are actually angled outwards, so they are not perfectly vertical. Now this would give very slightly increased longitudinal stability due to their location at the rear of the aircraft, however, the majority of ventral fins (as is the primary intention of them) have no effect on longitudinal stability.",

Prior to each flight, the pilots input the aircraft mass and CG location into the Flight Management System (FMS). The aircraft's FMS then informs the FBW system of this data, allowing for the correct control forces and limitations to be used, giving flight envelope protection and ensuring stability is maintained.\nConsider what will happen to the aircraft's high altitude handling characteristics if the pilot inputs the INCORRECT CG position into the FMS, located forward of the actual CG position. Which of the following statements is correct?",

            "explanation": "An aircraft's stability, and in particular its longitudinal stability (stability in pitch) is massively dependent on the location of the aircraft's Centre of Gravity (CG). As long as the CG is in front of the \"neutral point\", the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. The \"neutral point\" is a sort of average Centre of Pressure (CP) for the whole aircraft, and it goes towards where there are more aerodynamic surfaces. Think of a throwing dart, the front had a weight and the back has a set of fins, therefore a very far forward CG and a far back \"neutral point\". This is a very stable system. A far forward CG therefore is a more stable condition. This also means a less manoeuvrable condition. Less manoeuvrability means that the pilot will have to push and pull harder on the controls to achieve the same result, as the control surfaces need to move further to achieve the same angular change. The controls feel \"heavier\" with a further forward CG, but the aircraft is more stable. This can be counteracted by the Fly-By-Wire system, which uses the knowledge of the aircraft's weight and CG position to estimate the required control surface deflection, and make the controls feel the same as for any other CG position, so the pilot has the same control of the aircraft, no matter the weight or CG position. If the CG is further forwards, the FBW system will amplify the pilot's inputs more than normal in the pitch axis, to make the aircraft control as it would do \"normally\". This means that, in this scenario, the pilot has entered an artificially far forward CG, so the FBW system will amplify the pilot's actions in pitch, but without any need to do so, as the CG is not actually that far forward. This could lead to overcontrolling of the aircraft by the fly-by-wire system, as the aircraft is not as stable as the FMS/FBW believes. The overcontrolling could potentially reduce the stability of the aircraft, or even cause instability. As this question is easy to misread or misunderstand, we will quickly go through each option: \"Due to the design criteria applied, the longitudinal stability of the aircraft is always ensured, irrespective of the location of the CG.\" Whilst this looks plausible, the longitudinal stability is not ensured (and will be reduced or removed) when the CG goes out of the aft limit. \"The actual longitudinal stability is lower than calculated by the FBW system, and the system may allow for control surface deflections that result in instability.\" As mentioned above, this is correct, due to the incorrectly entered CG position, which may allow the FBW to overcontrol the aircraft. The aircraft is less stable than the FBW system believes. \"The aircraft consumes more fuel than expected during the cruise phase of the flight, as the FBW system deflects the horizontal stabiliser more to counteract the error of the pilot.\" The aircraft will actually consume less fuel than expected, but because the aircraft expects a forward CG in the cruise, which causes the tailplane to produce more downforce, and requires more lift from the wing, causing higher drag. However, the aircraft actually has a further aft CG, so will burn less fuel than expected. This is also not connected to the FBW system creating larger deflections, that is an effect which would occur in this case, but has negligible effect on fuel consumption. \"The pitch rates commanded by the FBW system are lower at higher altitudes compared to the pitch rates required to ensure that the longitudinal stability remains positive.\" This has nothing to do with the scenario mentioned in the question (incorrectly inputted CG location).",

In this case, the manufacturer has increased the size of the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer to account for the reduced fuselage length. The larger vertical fin provides greater surface area for controlling yaw, while the larger horizontal stabilizer increases pitch stability. The larger vertical fin increases the surface area available to resist the yawing moment caused by asymmetrical thrust, crosswinds, or other factors that could cause the aircraft to turn left or right. This results in improved directional stability of the aircraft, which means that it is less likely to deviate from its intended course. Therefore, option \"Positive, since the higher vertical fin.\" is the correct answer. The increased size of the vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer should not reduce the effectiveness of the rudder, as the rudder is the primary control surface for yaw control. In fact, the larger surface area of the vertical fin may even enhance the rudder's effectiveness, as it provides more area for the rudder to deflect and generate a yawing moment.",

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is almost trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, then, if the aircraft's rate of turn, rate of descent and speed are all decreasing, then it is naturally rolling out of the turn, and is therefore stable in the spiral (dive) mode.",

In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Noticeable changes in static stability can occur at high lift coefficients (low speed). This condition is The curve of CM versus CL of this illustration shows a good stable slope at low values of CL (high speed). Increasing CL gives a slight decrease in the negative slope hence a decrease in stability occurs. With continued increase in CL, the slope becomes zero and neutral stability exists. Eventually, the slope becomes positive and the airplane becomes unstable.",

Please send us any further feedback in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The yaw damper's main purpose is to prevent Dutch roll. Basically speaking, Dutch roll is a series of out-of-phase turns, when the aircraft rolls in one direction and yaws in the other due to a high amount of lateral stability but not quite enough directional stability. When the yaw is introduced, the strong “dihedral effect” will roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. Since the possibility of a Dutch roll increases with increasing altitude due to the lower aerodynamic damping at high altitude, aircraft can sometimes be restricted to fly at lower altitudes only when the yaw damper is unserviceable.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability. With a dominant lateral stability this will, when a yaw is introduced, roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into the wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. The CG position has little influence on the lateral stability, but an aft CG will reduce the directional stability because the Moment Arm of the stabilizing moment from the fin will decrease and thus increasing the likelihood of a Dutch roll.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect.

The aeroplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: a. dihedral; b. sweepback; c. high-wing mounting; d. increased effective dihedral; e. large, high vertical fin; f. low CG. As a result, of the sideslip, different parts of the aeroplane produce forces that together create a correcting rolling moment, which tends to restore the aeroplane to its original wings-level attitude. The lateral static stability reacts to the sideslip velocity ‘v’ or the displacement in yaw An aeroplane in a sideslip at a constant speed and constant sideslip angle increases the geometric dihedral of the wing, which requires an increased lateral control force or increased stick force.",

The magnitude of the fin contribution to static directional stability depends on both the change in fin lift and the fin moment arm. The lift curve slope of the fin determines how sensitive the surface is to change in angle of attack. While it is desirable to have a high lift curve slope for the fin, a high aspect ratio surface is not necessarily practical or desirable due to: - Bending - Lower stalling angle - Hangar roof clearance The stall angle of the surface must be large enough to prevent stall and subsequent loss of effectiveness at expected sideslip angles. Sweepback or low aspect ratio increases the stalling angle of attack of the fin and reduces the lift curve slope, therefore reducing static directional stability.",

In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point may be imagined as the effective aerodynamic center of the entire airplane configuration, i.e. with the CG at the neutral point, all changes in net lift effectively occur at that point and no change in pitching moment results. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. As seen in figure 1, neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment. The further aft the neutral point is from the CG the greater is the static longitudinal stability.",

The aeroplane with positive manoeuvring stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. When the aeroplane has high static stability, the manoeuvring stability will be high and a high stick force gradient will result. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing manoeuvring stability.",

It is a measure of the aircraft’s ability to realign itself with the relative airflow. An airplane has directional static stability if, when in a sideslip with the airflow coming from the right initially the nose tends to yaw right. The drag of a swept wing is less than that of an unswept wing. The advantage of this type of wing at high speeds is gained at the expense of its poor performance at low speed. The drag experienced with a swept wing is the component of the relative airflow at 90◦ to the line joining the aerodynamic center of the wing, which if the wing has parallel leading and trailing edges will be the normal to the leading edge of the wing. In figure 1 the normal component of the relative airflow is greater on the port wing than the normal component on the starboard wing. The drag on the leading wing, the port wing, in figure 1 is of greater magnitude than that of the trailing starboard wing because of its decreased effective sweep angle. It is therefore a stabilizing influence. Positive sweepback has a stabilizing effect on directional stability because the CP is further aft, and the stalling angle is increased. The significance and magnitude of this effect on directional static stability is directly proportional to the angle of sweepback.",

LONGITUDINAL STABILITY (figure 1) Longitudinal stability is motion about the lateral axis. An aircraft will exhibit static longitudinal stability if it tends to return towards the trim angle of attack when displaced by a gust OR a control input. If the tail moment is greater than the wing moment, the sum of the moments will not be zero and the resultant nose-down moment will give an angular acceleration about the CG. The nose-down angular acceleration about the CG will return the aircraft towards its original position of equilibrium. The greater the tail moment relative to the wing moment, the greater the rate of acceleration towards the original equilibrium position. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. STICK FORCE STABILITY (STICK FORCE PER G) (figure 2) The force on the stick required to change the aircraft's load factor by 1 G. One of the biggest factors for changing stick force stability is the change of stability from a movement of the CG. Moving the CG forwards increases the stability of the aircraft, thereby reducing manoeuvrability, and increasing stick force stability, as seen by the steeper line on figure 2 when the CG is at 10% MAC (far forward CG = higher stick force per G). The change in mass on its own causes an unknown change to the stick force per G without in-depth analysis into the particular aircraft (so we assume no change), and the only change in stick force stability comes from the CG movement.",

In this case the outside wing will generate more lift as it travels faster. This tends to roll the airplane in the direction of the yaw. The rolling force overcomes the weak dihedral effect, allowing further roll. As the vertical component of lift decreases, the relative wind has an upward component with the airplane swinging in alignment with the air stream, the nose begins to drop.

When a wing drops, due to a disturbance, the tendency of the aeroplane to correct this departure from the balanced condition in level flight is dependent on the lateral stability of the aeroplane. Additionally, when a wing drops, it causes other secondary motions to be initiated. The fin and rudder tend to yaw the aeroplane into the airflow in the direction of the dropped wing. Because of the yaw, the higher wing on the outside of the turn is travelling faster than the lower wing and develops a greater amount of lift. This generates a rolling moment in the opposite direction to the correcting moment of the dihedral and if the rolling moment is greater it will tend to increase the angle of bank. If the rolling moment is of sufficient magnitude to overcome the correcting force, produced by the dihedral and the damping yaw effect, the bank angle will increase and the aeroplane will enter a steadily steepening spiral dive.

A dorsal fin is a small aero foil, of very low aspect ratio, mounted on top of the fuselage near the rear. A ventral fin is mounted below. If the aircraft is yawed to the right, the dorsal and ventral fins will create a side force to the right. The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service. While dorsal and ventral fins contribute positively to directional static stability, a dorsal fin contributes positively to lateral static stability, while a ventral fin is destabilizing in this mode and has no effect on longitudinal stability. It creates lift below CG in the direction of the roll.",

For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment. The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by arm ‘x’. The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm ‘y’. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. If the nose-down (negative) tail moment is greater than the nose-up (positive) wing moment, the aircraft will have static longitudinal stability.",

If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

The control forces of the aeroplane should reflect the stability of the aeroplane and provide suitable reference to the pilot for precise control of the aeroplane. When the CG position of the aeroplane is fixed, each elevator position corresponds to a particular trim lift coefficient. As the CG is moved aft, the slope of this line decreases, and the decrease in stability is evident by a given control displacement causing a greater change in trim lift coefficient. This is evidence that decreasing stability causes increased controllability and, of course, increasing stability decreases controllability. For the same value of CL, a more stable aircraft (forward CG) will require a higher elevator deflection. If the CG is moved aft until the line of trim CL versus elevator deflection has zero slope, neutral static stability is obtained.",

It is the change to the stability of an airplane with the passage of time. Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

Static stability pertains to how a system reacts immediately when disturbed. In a statically stable system, it initially moves back toward its equilibrium state. An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Manoeuvrability, on the other hand, is the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various manoeuvres. Stability and manoeuvrability are effectively opposite, and the greater an aircraft's stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, and vice-versa. An aircraft with a further forward CG has greater stability (but lower manoeuvrability) and aircraft with aft CG locations have lower stability, but higher manoeuvrability. Higher weight also tends to reduce manoeuvrability, but this rule isn't always as simple as the CG locations. The question tells us that stability is affected by the CG location and the gross weight of the aircraft, and, knowing that manoeuvrability and stability are closely (and inversely) linked, that hints to us that those factors also affect the manoeuvrability, which they do. That removes the following options: \"cannot be affected by the pilot or operator as it is determined by the aircraft design.\", as the CG location and weight can be affected by the operator/pilot, so therefore, the manoeuvrability can be too; and \"is determined by the size of the control surfaces only, not the CG position or the weight.\", as the manoeuvrability is changed by the CG location and weight. The other options can be chosen between based on the CG location and weight, and the effects of those mentioned above.",

When an airplane has positive longitudinal dynamic stability the amplitude of the oscillations gradually diminish as the aircraft returns to its original trimmed flight state. The oscillatory motion of the airplane in pitch after a disturbance to its trimmed state can be shown as two separate oscillations. One is a short-period oscillation and the other is a long-period oscillation called a phugoid. The phugoid is usually poorly damped; it has large variations of speed and height and has an almost uniform load factor (n). It has a constant energy motion in which the potential energy and the kinetic energy are continuously interchanging. The motion that causes short-period oscillation is normally heavily damped. It not only involves small changes of speed and height but also large changes of load factor. The speed and height of the airplane remain approximately constant.",

The term controllability refers to the ability of the aircraft to respond to control surface displacement and achieve the desired condition of flight. Adequate controllability must be available to perform take-off and landing and accomplish the various maneuvers in flight. A contradiction exists between stability and controllability. A high degree of stability gives reduced controllability. The relationship between static stability and controllability is demonstrated by figure 1 and 2. The effect of increased static stability (forward CG movement) on controllability is illustrated by the ball in a steeper trough (figure 2). A greater force is required to “control” the ball to the same position of displacement when the static stability is increased. In this manner, a large degree of static stability tends to make the aircraft less controllable. It is necessary to achieve the proper proportion between static stability and controllability during the design of an aircraft because too much static stability (forward CG position) reduces controllability. The forward CG limit is set to ensure minimum controllability.",

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

            "explanation": "Note: This is a completely different scenario to the similar questions that exist about spins. A spiral dive occurs when an aircraft is very directionally stable (stable in yaw) and not very laterally stable (stable in roll). When a significant sideslip is induced, a stable aircraft will want to yaw very towards the oncoming airflow direction, and in a balanced aircraft, would also roll away from the oncoming airflow direction. However, the aircraft's roll would not be as strong in this scenario, and the strong yawing effect may even overpower it, which would cause the aircraft to yaw and roll towards the oncoming airflow. This intense yawing effect basically overpowers the other aspects of stability and makes the aircraft bank in the same direction, which forms a spiral dive. Spiral dives can make the aircraft speed up very quickly and can cause overspeed or overstress if not dealt with quickly, as they get worse with time. Spiral dives are referred to as \"aperiodic\" motion as they do not go back and forth (like dutch roll), they only happen once, getting further from equilibrium. The key part of this question is that spiral dives are always pointing downwards, as they are a dive. If the nose was upwards, they would be a stall/spin. Note that you can easily create an accelerated stall leading to a spin from a spiral dive, if handled incorrectly.",

This force may be reduced to zero by operation of the trim controls. The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. A Trimmable Horizontal Stabiliser (THS) enables a larger CG and speed range than a conventional tailplane with stabiliser, elevator and trim tab, because the whole stabiliser may be moved for trimming the aeroplane, instead of a relatively “small” elevator and trim tab only (a larger surface is much more effective). This also leads to more control difficulty due to a jammed stabiliser. An aircraft on final apporach is configured and trimmed for low speed, i.e. nose up trim. This means that, in case of go-around, the pilot should be prepared to apply nose down or trim nose down to prevent excessive pitch up caused by the additional power.",

Tail strike – the rotation is started before it is possible to lift-off, consequently angle of attack might be increased up to tail strike. In this case, a 12% CG position will tend to hold the nose down (nose-heavy). To counter this, the pilots need to set a nose up trim in order to create a nose-up pitching moment at rotation. The actual CG position is however more aft which will naturally help lifting the aircraft nose.

The aileron angled downward (the left aileron in this example) produces more drag and more lift, initially yawing the airplane in the opposite direction of your roll.",

Its deflection is controlled by a trim wheel or electrical switch in the cockpit, arranged to operate in an instinctive sense. To maintain the primary control surface in its required position, the tab is moved in the opposite direction to the control surface until the tab moment balances the control surface hinge moment. Stabiliser Trim (figure 2) This system of trimming may be used on manually operated and power operated controls. To trim, the tailplane incidence is adjusted by the trim wheel until the tailplane load is equal to the previous elevator balancing load required. Stick force is now zero. The main advantages of a variable incidence (trimming) tailplane are: - The drag is less in the trimmed state as the aerofoil is more streamlined. - Trimming does not reduce the effective range of pitch control as the elevator remains approximately neutral when the aircraft is trimmed. - It is very powerful and gives an increased ability to trim for larger CG and speed range. The disadvantage of a variable incidence (trimming) tailplane is that it is more complex and is heavier than a conventional trim tab system. In this exercise, Figures 1 and 3 refer to trim tabs, and Figures 2 and 4 refer to stabiliser Trim. The least amount of drag would be produced by a stabiliser trim where the position of the elevator is neutral, which, in this case, is Figure 4.",

The control forces of the airplane should reflect the stability of the airplane and provide suitable reference to the pilot for precise control of the airplane. The position of the CG not only affects the positive longitudinal static stability, it also affects the pitch handling characteristics. When the elevators are deflected, the pitching moment they produce must be greater than the restoring moment of the airplane’s positive longitudinal static stability. An aircraft has higher longitudinal stability with a forward CG (meaning the force and deflection required to make a pitch change is higher), so therefore an aft movement of CG decreases the stability (increases the manoeuvrability), providing the same change in load factor for a smaller control surface deflection.",

The control surface to cause the nose up movement is the elevator. The elevator is positioned behind the Center of Gravity, while the nose is positioned in front of it. Therefore, if the nose rises, the opposite action should happen at the tail. This is done by the elevator generating negative lift (also called downforce). The elevator does this by moving upwards, changing the aerodynamic camber of the tailplane to a negative camber. Whereas positive camber generates positive lift, negative camber generates negative lift. This effect pushes the tail (which is positioned behind the CG) downwards, which has an opposite reaction on the nose (in front of the CG), which comes up.",

This question is incredibly vague, and as yet we really don't know what the examiner wants from us, and the answer is not confirmed (we are not very sure of it either). In particular, we don't know how degraded the FBW system is, and what the options are regarding the control differences. FLY-BY-WIRE In a fly-by-wire aircraft, the pilot inputs commands via a sidestick or yoke to a computer. The computer then processes these inputs and sends corresponding electrical signals to the servo valve which in turn controls the movement of a hydraulic actuator, which will hydraulically deflect a flight control surface. There are numerous advantages to fly by wire systems, including weight savings and safety features that can be incorporated into the computer software. FBW also enables highly reliable flight envelope protection systems which, provided the FBW system functions at its normal level, significantly enhances safety. Feedback control of airspeed, Mach Number, attitude, and angle of attack can be used to ensure that the FBW aircraft stays within its certificated flight envelope. FBW has multiple different modes of \"control laws\" which can be used. Normal Law - All control augmentations and protections are in place. Alternate Law - Some protections are lost, some features act differently to normal, and the autopilot may be lost (depending on the fault). Direct Law - In direct law, the pilot's controls are NOT augmented at all by the internal computers (for flight envelope protection, etc.), and the exact control movement is sent exactly as it is to the hydraulic servo valves. Autopilot is always lost. Stall and over speed warnings are still available. Mechanical back-up - Not really a control law at all, if FBW has failed, then all that is left is some form of mechanical back-up, for instance on the A320, it is some rudder control and manual trimming. Therefore, a large degradation of the aircraft, down to direct law or mechanical back-up will cause large changes in control for the pilots. It will often be quite a different aircraft to fly in this case. As for why the two aircraft might have different reactions to a degradation in FBW, we don't really know. We need more information to be able to dig into that.",

For many candidates, this question is simply solved by removing the incorrect options and seeing what you have left: \"Anti-icing fluid has built up between the elevator and horizontal stabiliser.\" This is actually possible, and in fact there have been quite a few reports over the years of rejected take-offs at rotation when the aircraft has failed to rotate correctly after de-icing. So much so that EASA commissioned a report to be made, testing de-icing fluid and its effects on a horizontal stabiliser section. The build-up of thickening fluids on the front of the elevator can make it very resistive to movements during take-off, especially with manual flight controls. Although it is not in the current learning objectives, it seems that an examiner wants you to know about it. Thankfully, it is the only possible correct option. \"The control cables connecting the control column to the elevator have torn.\" This would not be a case that is specific to icing conditions, and the cables tearing could cause a few different feelings on the control column, but most likely very light resistance to movement, not heavy. The aircraft also would not respond at all. \"The ailerons have frozen in position.\" The ailerons provide roll control, so whilst this is a bad situation, a pilot would not notice that the nose was heavy, as the pitch is controlled by the elevators. \"The increased air density means insufficient thrust is being produced to reach VR.\" Quite the other way, high air density due to the cold air would cause higher thrust from the engine, and better performance.",

However, they are not suitable for jet airplanes because of their large range of operating speeds, preference, for this type of airplane, is given to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer. There are two types of trim tab in common use: the variable and the fixed. The variable trim tabs may be manually or electrically controlled. If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up. This does not affect the static longitudinal stability. Anti-balance tab Because the hinge moment on some airplanes is too small, often as the result of the CP being too close to the hinge-line of the control surface, it is too easy to deflect the control surface against the aerodynamic load. Consequently, there is little control column load and there is a lack of feel to the controls. This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe. To counteract these characteristics and assist the pilot to use the control surfaces correctly it is necessary to have anti-balance tabs fitted. These operate in the opposite sense to the balance tab by deflecting the anti-balance tab in the same direction as that of the primary control surface and increase the aerodynamic loading.",

            "explanation": "In flight, an aircraft can rotate about any one, or any combination of, its three axes. These axes are at right angles to each other and all pass through the aircraft’s centre of gravity. The moment around an axis is produced by changing the aerodynamic force on the appropriate aerofoil. The magnitude of the force is a product of the dynamic pressure (IAS) and the angular displacement of the control surface. Aerodynamic force can be changed by: - adjusting the camber of the aerofoil. - changing the incidence of the aerofoil. - decreasing lift and increasing drag by “spoiling” the airflow. Changing the camber of any aerofoil (wing, tailplane or fin) will change its lift. Deflecting a control surface effectively changes its camber. AILERONS The primary effect of ailerons is to provide roll control about the longitudinal axis A downward movement of the aileron causes an increase in the effective angle of attack and a corresponding increase in lift, whilst an upward movement of the aileron causes a reduction in the effective angle of attack and a decrease in lift. The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment.",

Creating an unstable situation. Therefore, the effect is destabilizing. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

The only power supplied is by the pilot. Power assisted controls - The pilot is mechanically connected to the controls, but any force they exert will be assisted by extra force from the hydraulics. Similar to powered steering in a car. Fully powered controls - The flight controls physically move a servo valve which directs hydraulic pressure to the controls. No computers involved, but hydraulic pressure is absolutely required. Fly-by-wire - The flight control movements are interpreted by a computer which electronically controls the hydraulic servo valves to move the control surfaces. The hydraulics still provide the power to move the control surfaces, but a computer sits between the pilot and the hydraulics, checking and modifying the requested movements. Fly-by-wire and fully powered controls are \"irreversible\", meaning that there is no feedback from the control surfaces to the pilot. This means that an artificial feel system has to be installed, so the pilot can feel the correct amount of resistance when moving the controls. This is not the case on manual or power assisted control systems, which have natural feedback to the flight controls. Fly-by-wire systems do not have to be joystick controlled.

If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up.

As shown schematically in the diagram, a device sensitive to dynamic pressure (1⁄2 ρ V2). Pitot pressure is fed to one side of a chamber and static pressure to the other, which moves a diaphragm under the influence of changing dynamic pressure with airspeed. This causes “regulated” hydraulic pressure to provide a resistance or ‘feel’ on the pilot’s input controls proportional to IAS2, just as in a manual control. In addition, stick force should increase as stick displacement increases. An advantage of artificial feel is that it can be configured to provide envelope protection, which prevents the pilot over stressing the aircraft. The Boeing777 fly- by-wire system employs envelope protection. This feature of the artificial-feel system provides increasingly greater force when the aircraft is pushed to its limits.",

            "explanation": "CG position VS Aircraft’s performance A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. FORWARD CG increases the pitch down moment tendency of the aircraft. Therefore, greater horizontal stabilizer and elevator deflections are needed to give the aircraft a pitch-up attitude to compensate for the pitch-down moment. Extra lift is generated by increasing the angle of attack, which in turn increases induced drag. Thus performance decreases. For take-off, if the CG position is too far forward, the aircraft is said to have a “heavy nose”. Conversely, as the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since Climb gradient is a product of excess of thrust over drag, climb performance will be improved. For take-off, if the CG position is too far aft, the aircraft is said to have a “light nose” making the rotation easier. Additionally, an aircraft which requires less lift will have a slower rotation speed, which results in a reduced take-off distance. To simplify this concept and make it easier to answer these type of question you can think of a forward CG as having the same effects as a heavy aircraft; and an aft CG as having the same result as a light aircraft.",

On the wing with the down-going aileron, they remain retracted. Unlike ailerons, spoilers cannot give an increase of lift, so a roll manoeuvre controlled by spoilers will give a net loss of lift. However, the spoiler has several advantages compared to the aileron: - There is no adverse yaw. - Wing twisting is reduced. - At transonic speed, its effectiveness is not reduced by shock wave induced flow separation. - They cannot develop flutter. - Spoilers do not occupy the trailing edge, which can be utilised for more flaps. An example is illustrated in the attached figure. Speed brakes have been selected, and then a turn to the left is initiated. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the up-going aileron will stay deployed, or modulate upwards, depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron will modulate towards the stowed position. The spoiler surfaces on the wing with the down-going aileron may partially or fully stow, again depending on the speed brake selection and the roll input. Note: Roll control spoilers are generally distributed throughout the wing, and the system depends on pilot input to modulate the degree of deflection and which spoilers to extend or retract. On this question, it seems that EASA considers the most likely to extend to be the outboard spoilers. If you see this question in your exam, we strongly recommend you appeal and report back to us any changes made to this question.",

Creating an unstable situation. Therefore, the effect is destabilizing. If the thrust line is above the CG, this is the opposite of the above and a thrust increase will produce a nose down moment (negative moment), and, in moderate amounts, can have a stabilising effect. The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Thrust is in line with CG. The airplane will start to climb (or reduce descent) and will settle on the same AoA and roughly the same speed.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. When the aircraft's CG (Centre of Gravity) is located far forwards within the aircraft, the aircraft's stability is high, and its manoeuvrability is low. When the CG is located further aft, the aircraft is less stable, but more manoeuvrable. Pitch manoeuvrability is measured by the \"stick force per G\" (stick force stability), meaning how much force the pilot needs to apply to the controls to gain an extra 1G of vertical acceleration. The higher the stick force stability, the lower the manoeuvrability, so in this question, as the CG has been moved aft by the cargo, the manoeuvrability will be increased, so the stick force stability will decrease. The second part of this question is about the aircraft's trim in relation to the CG location. Most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. The trim is often done (and in this question certainly done) by an all moving tailplane, known as a variable-incidence horizontal stabiliser, so the whole stabiliser moves to perform the act of trimming. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra cargo behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards. This will be the same during the cruise, where less nose down moment will be required, so the leading edge of the stabiliser will be pointing more upwards than if the cargo was not loaded.",

Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance. To counter adverse yaw, some aircraft incorporate aileron/rudder coupling which is a system that automatically applies a rudder input in a turn to counter the adverse yawing moments generated by the ailerons. In a right turn, the left wing lift is increased by lowering the aileron. As we have described above, increased lift, increases induced drag, which generates a yawing moment in the opposite direction. As a result, the aircraft will be in an unbalanced turn. To re-balance the turn, right rudder must be applied.",

Adverse (aileron) yaw is corrected in the design by the use of either differential ailerons or Frise ailerons. The differential aileron deflection system ensures that the drag generated by both ailerons when rolling into or out of a turn is equal, thus eliminating adverse yaw. This is achieved by constructing the aileron system such that the angular deflection of the upgoing aileron is always proportionately greater than the deflection of the down going aileron.",

If you encounter this question during your official exam, kindly inform us. We appreciate your assistance. 081.05.07.01.01: Explain which parameters may be controlled in level flight with the pitch control law. Fly-by-wire is a sophisticated system that substitutes the traditional manual-mechanical flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. Within this system, a computer interface is interposed between the pilots and the final control surfaces. Modern commercial fly-by-wire aircraft integrate a flight-envelope protection system into their flight control software, which is housed within the flight control computer. This protection system serves the crucial role of preventing pilots from issuing control commands that could push the aircraft beyond its structural and aerodynamic operational boundaries. In the realm of fly-by-wire technology, the concept of flight envelope and maneuvering envelope protections is employed. These are governed by predefined control laws that serve as a set of rules, guiding the computers in transforming input signals. One of the most commonly used control laws involves managing the load factor in pitch control. Essentially, this means that the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) adjusts its position to maintain a specific load factor. When the pilot manipulates the sidestick, the THS moves accordingly, altering the load factor proportionally to the sidestick's deflection (refer to the attached diagram). This means that as long as the sidestick remains untouched, the aircraft will maintain its flight-path-angle-corrected load factor. For example, if the aircraft is in straight and level flight and the pilot pulls the sidestick, the aircraft will follow a curved trajectory, increasing its pitch angle until the sidestick is released.",

The elevators are hinged control surfaces located on the horizontal tail plane usually at the rear of the airplane. A forward movement of the control column (stick) by the pilot will cause the elevators to go down and a backward movement will cause them to go up. The effect produced by the elevators is to increase the camber of the tail plane when the stick is pushed forward, which causes an increase of tail plane lift and an upward force on the underside of the control surface that results in the airplane rotating about its lateral axis through the CG and the nose being depressed. The opposite is true when the stick is pulled back, the camber is negative, and the lift generated is downward which when trimmed becomes the counterbalancing force required for longitudinal equilibrium.",

It may therefore be written quite differently in the exam, and we cannot ensure that it is even precisely the same question, so do read it careful and evaluate that yourself, and please place any further feedback in the comments, thank you! Adverse yaw is a yawing motion with an opposite direction to the turning/rolling motion of the aircraft. Adverse yaw is caused by the drag on the down-going aileron being greater than that on the up-going aileron. This is because the down-going aileron is effectively acting like a trailing edge flap with high camber, so higher drag, but the up-going aileron is reducing the camber of the wing, so has a lower drag. This imbalance in drag causes the yawing motion around the normal/vertical axis. Since this yaw is adverse (i.e., in a banked turn to the left, the yaw is to the right), it is opposing the turn, which is detrimental to the aircraft's performance and may cause uncoordinated turns. Adverse (aileron) yaw is corrected in the design by the use of either differential ailerons, Frise ailerons or aileron/rudder coupling. The differential aileron system counteracts adverse yaw by making the draggy down-going aileron go proporitonally less far, so a smaller angular change, than the low drag up-going aileron. This means that the up-going aileron does more of the work, and therefore produces a similar amount of drag to the other aileron, and the aircraft roll rate is the same. This could mean, for instance, that the up-going aileron moves 30% further upwards than the down-going aileron goes downwards. For this question, BE VERY CAREFUL. The higher drag down-going aileron is on the UP-GOING WING. This means that; The up-going wing produces a greater amount of drag when normal ailerons are fitted. The differential ailerons will therefore make the aileron on that wing move less far to counteract the adverse yaw effect.",

If you see this question in the exam, please send anything you can remember to us in the comments, through the question feedback tab on your dashboard or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. In any conventional aircraft, the application of rudder will cause some secondary effect of roll, usually towards the direction that the rudder was applied. This effect is very strong in swept wing aircraft, and very noticeable when flying them, hence the reason most jets of this kind are flown without the use of the rudder pedals except for engine failures and crosswind take-offs and landings. Using full rudder deflection only to intercept the final approach course is a terrible idea as the aircraft will violently roll to the right. This is because the left wing will be significantly accelerated through a much longer arc that the right wing, which conversely gets a much reduced speed of airflow during that motion, causing a large right wing drop, and the right wing could even stall if the effect were large enough to increase the right wing's angle of attack above the critical AoA. As for the other answers: The left wing would not stall as there is greater airspeed over it and with no significant increase of angle of attack. Adverse yaw is a secondary effect which occurs when ailerons are used for roll purposes, so does not really apply to this situation. There is indeed a potential for loss of control to occur in this scenario, but we think this answer is way too vague (and the feedback was also not 100% about the wording here so we can't confirm it yet) so for now we are saying this is less correct than the potential for the right wing stalling.",

The horizontal straight line joining the most forward point of the fuselage of the airplane, the center of the nose, to the center of the most rearward point of the airplane’s fuselage is the longitudinal axis. It is often referred to as the roll axis because the airplane, in response to a control input by the pilot or as the result of an external disturbance, drops one wing and raises the other. Thus, it rotates or rolls about the longitudinal axis. The flight controls enable the pilot to rotate the airplane about its three axes. The ailerons and the rudder cause the airplane to roll about its longitudinal axis, the elevators enable the airplane to pitch around its lateral axis and the rudder allows the airplane to yaw around its normal axis.",

When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable. Aeroplane 2: the thrust line is below the CG (the case of most airliners with underwing engines), therefore a thrust increase will produce an added pitch-up moment. This will cause the airplane to slow down more than necessary (despite the added thrust). Creating an unstable situation. To counteract this, a pitch-down moment must be created. Therefore, the elevator must be deflected downwards. Regardless of the type of aircraft, adjusting the configuration will always result in a trim change.

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and during the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is what the question is referring to. Adding extra fuel behind the CG will move the CG backwards, making the aircraft more tail heavy. This will require more nose-down stabiliser trim to feel the same on take-off. A nose-down stabiliser trim is caused by providing less downforce (or extra lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a higher angle, with its leading edge pointing more upwards.",

            "explanation": "Note: this question is much too vague to be able to correctly work out in its current format. There are so many clarifying questions that need to be asked in order to work out the second part of the question correctly. Therefore, we will explain to you the basics here, then you can let us know if you see it in the exam, and what the correct answer was (or if the question/options were different at all), thank you! This comes back to stability, and longitudinal stability in particular (stability in pitch). Think of a stable aircraft like a throwing dart, weight at the front, fins at the back, and it is incredibly stable flying through the air, always landing facing into the dartboard. This is the same for an aircraft, and we have to make our \"weight\" (Centre of Gravity, CG) in front of our \"wings\", which are dictated by the Centre of Pressure (CP)/Centre of lift (CL) of our wings and other aerodynamic features. The \"neutral point\" is the average location of the pressure effects from all our wings, fuselage, engine cowlings and other aerodynamic features, sort of the balanced centre of pressure of the whole aircraft. As long as our CG is in front of our neutral point, then the aircraft will be longitudinally stable. Also, the weight, acting through the CG, is not in line with all the lift, acting through the CP. This means that the further forward weight will cause a nose-down moment. We obviously have to counteract this moment, and this is why the tailplane is tasked with providing a downwards force on the aircraft tail, causing a balancing nose-up moment. Of course, the movement of the CG and CP can change how much downforce the tail needs to produce. If the CG moves further forwards, the tailplane has to produce higher downforce to counteract the larger nose down moment, and vice-versa. The way that the tailplane produces downforce is two-fold. It usually has a low/negative angle of incidence, to provide a negative angle of attack, and the downwash from the wings causes an even larger negative angle of attack, particularly at high aircraft AoA (low speed), when the wing downwash angle is greater. This is why tailplanes have elevators, to change their angle of attack for control, and for trimming at different speeds. This does not unfortunately help us get a solid answer for this question. Of course, the increased speed means a higher airflow over the tailplane, but also leads to decreased downwash angle from the main wing (due to lower angle of attack), but now with a more negative angle of attack without accounting for downwash due to the lower pitch angle of the aeroplane. These are opposing effects, and without knowing the aircraft and speed range, it is really very difficult to say whether the force increases or decreases. Our tendency is to say that the downwash angle and pitch angle mostly cancel each other out, and that the increased airflow increases the down-force of the tailplane. We can also justify this by saying that when an aircraft gets faster, we have to trim down, which is us artificially decreasing the downforce of our tailplane via the elevator, this means the downforce must have been too large after the speed increase, therefore the force increased. We do not like having to use this as an justification, as there are other forces at play, but it works quite well for everyone to understand.",

A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is impossible to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. Therefore, first, the pilot must disconnect the autopilot to stop any autopilot fault from making the situation worse. They should then attempt to control the aircraft manually, and if the trim runaway continues, switch off the electric trim and trim manually. On balance, we would say that both of the actions in the question are correct, and with pretty much correct reasoning, although there will be an order in which to do these actions, set out by the manufacturer. We haven't had this answer confirmed though, so please let us know if you see this in the real exam, and anything you can remember about it, thank you!",

            "explanation": "The CG location plays a crucial role in the stability and control of the aircraft. If the CG is too far forward, the aircraft may be excessively nose-heavy, making it difficult to rotate during takeoff. If the CG is too far aft, the aircraft may be excessively tail-heavy, leading to difficulty in controlling the pitch attitude. When an aircraft has an aft center of gravity (CG), it will tend to rotate rapidly during takeoff and naturally adopt a high nose attitude during climb-out. Conversely, if the CG is forward (nose-heavy), the opposite effect will occur. To counterbalance these tendencies and ensure a smooth takeoff, the position of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) is adjusted. This adjustment aims to achieve two goals: first, to maintain a standard rotation rate, and second, to facilitate the aircraft settling into the desired climb-out attitude with minimal trim adjustments.",

Direct Law is the lowest level of fly-by-wire system and directly transmits the pilot inputs to control surfaces, while still giving stall and load factor warnings Mechanical back up. In case all of the above fail, the system reverts to mechanical backup, where pitch control is achieved through the horizontal stabilizer and lateral control is accomplished using the rudder pedals. The purpose of the backup system is to allow control of the aircraft following a total loss of electrics, flight control computers, elevators, or ailerons and spoilers In case of mechanical backup, the system will operate as long as hydraulic power is available. In case of electrical failure, as long as hydraulics are OK, the pilot should be able to control the aircraft.",

In this setup, the flying control is connected to a small servo tab mounted on the trailing edge of the main control surface, rather than directly to the control surface itself. Moving the servo tab generates a force that moves the main control surface. In summary, the control surface is only moved by aerodynamic forces while the servo tab is moved directly by the pilot. Regarding this question: Imagine the aircraft is parked with no wind and the flight controls are not locked. The control surface would tilt down due to gravity. If the pilot moves the controls, only the servo tab moves; the control surface stays tilted down. When taxiing with a headwind, the control surface can level out due to aerodynamic forces. The pilot can then adjust the angle using the servo tab, though less effectively than in flight. If taxiing with a tailwind stronger than the aircraft's speed, the relative wind from behind can push the control surface up or down, depending on its previous position. Thus, the statement that \"the position is undetermined during taxiing, in particular with tailwind\" is correct.",

Consequently, the slope of the total lift vector generates a rearward component on the upgoing wing and a forward component on the down going wing. These are yaw moments but in the opposite direction to that of the roll caused by the difference of the induced drag of each wing. This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: rudder/aileron coupling. slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. differential aileron deflection. The differential aileron deflection system ensures that the drag generated by both ailerons when rolling into or out of a turn is equal, thus eliminating adverse yaw. This is achieved by constructing the aileron system such that the angular deflection of the upgoing aileron is always proportionately greater than the deflection of the down going aileron.",

Summary: A trimmable horizontal stabiliser is more suitable to cope with the large trim changes generated by the high lift devices on most jet transport aeroplanes. \"II. A trim tab runaway causes less control difficulty.\" CORRECT Runaway trim occurs when the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) or other trim devices on the aircraft tail fails to stop at the desired position and continues to deflect up or down. A trim tab is much smaller than a trimmable horizontal stabiliser. Therefore, if it runs to the wrong position, it will produce smaller forces than a THS, thus causing less control difficuty.",

            "explanation": "Ailerons are the control surface on an aircraft that controls roll. They are usually mounted at the tips of the wings, to create the largest moment arm between them and the centre of gravity, for greater effectiveness. This can become problematic, particularly at high speeds. At high speeds, the forces on a control surface are so great that they can actually twist the wing they are connected to. The further outboard the ailerons are, the easier it is to cause the wing to twist, as it has less stiffness. Imagine a down-going aileron, used to increase the lift of the wing and make the wing rise. This would also twist the wing so its trailing edge was up, and therefore the leading edge goes down, causing the wing to lose lift, and the wing would drop, instead of rising. We call this aileron reversal, shown in the annex above. This is why many high speed aircraft often have secondary ailerons, which are called inboard ailerons, much closer to the fuselage, that are used during high speed flight, and the outboard ailerons are locked in place to avoid control reversal, flutter, and other structural issues due to the high aerodynamic forces. Some aircraft use roll spoilers also. There is also a low speed aileron reversal that happens near the stall, so be aware of the similar names.",

These are yaw moments but in the opposite direction to that of the roll caused by the difference of the induced drag of each wing. This is adverse yaw, which is particularly significant at low airspeeds because of the large aileron deflection necessary to achieve the same rate of roll as at higher speeds with less deflection. Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. frise ailerons. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. The deflection of the ailerons on airplanes fitted with rudder coupling causes the rudder to move an amount proportional to the angular displacement of the aileron and to oppose adverse yaw.",

If it is necessary for a control surface to be deflected to maintain balance of the aircraft, the pilot will need to apply a force to the cockpit control to hold the surface in its deflected position. This force may be reduced to zero by operation of the trim controls. The aircraft may need to be trimmed in pitch as a result of: - changes of speed. - changes of power. - varying CG positions. - changes of configuration. VARIABLE INCIDENCE TAILPLANE The Variable Incidence Horizontal Stabiliser provides pitch trim on most transport category aircraft. Varying the angle of incidence has the same effect as moving the elevator, but is aerodynamically more efficient, particularly at high airspeeds, and can provide a considerable trim range. An actuator near the leading edge varies the angle of incidence of the stabiliser. This normally operates in conjunction with the elevator to produce the least trim drag. The position of the CG directly affects the amount of trim necessary for the angle of attack required. A forward CG adds to the inherent longitudinal stability of the aeroplane; the pilot may run out of elevator up movement and be unable to maintain the required attitude. An aft CG decreases the longitudinal stability and makes the aeroplane more difficult or impossible to control in pitch. The CG must remain within the CG safe envelope at all times to ensure that the aeroplane remains controllable in all phases of flight. The elevator trim or stabiliser trim setting must be preset to a value for take-off and initial climb that will ensure a minimum stick force during this critical stage of flight. In comparison with a correctly balanced aeroplane during take-off, the position of the stabiliser for a nose-light aeroplane requires nose-down trim from an increased stabiliser angle of incidence.",

These controls are fitted with transducers which convert the mechanical movement into an electrical output which is then amplified and processed by several computers. These computers provide the input for the servo valves which controls the movement of the hydraulic actuators attached to the flight control surfaces. Advantages of fly by wire Weight reduction, as there is no need for the long and heavy control cables this is a big reduction in the weight of the aircraft. Pilot work load is reduced because the pilot is supported by the computers with automated features like auto trim and turn coordination. Flight envelope protection, which can prevent the pilot from pitching up too much beyond the stalling angle of attack. It can limit the controls in such a way that the airframe will not endure Gforces out of the limits. Disadvantages Reliability, as conventional systems might give some indication of an upcoming failure, a fly by wire system can lose a computer would could result in loss of control. This means there is need for redundancy in the form of additional computers and hydraulic systems.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating.

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. In this case, if an aircraft is very stable (forward CG), the elevator will have to produce a bigger moment to move the pitch and thus requires a larger deflection",

They also need large control surfaces to be able to control such large aircraft. For these reasons, elevators are often not enough on their own to provide all the pitch trim and pitch control required. Some aircraft use a variable incidence horizontal stabiliser and elevators, which just means that the whole tailplane moves in order to trim the aircraft and the elevators are a control surface on the back of this. Some aircraft go even further than this, and have something known as an \"all moving tailplane\", or \"all-flying tailplane\", and is also known as a \"slab tail\". This has no elevator surface at the back, and combines the trim and control inputs into a single movement that the whole tail makes. This is more efficient than using elevators only, as it is a large (full wing) surface making a small change, rather than smaller elevators making a large change, and this not only causes a lot less aerodynamic drag, but also requires less force from the aircraft's hydraulic systems. The reason less force is required to move the all-flying tailplane than elevators is because elevators are hinged at the front, whereas \"slab tails\" rotate around a point closer to the middle, and therefore the front of the tail helps the movement somewhat. Also, a much smaller movement is required, which does not \"fight\" the airflow as much, like an elevator does. This is why they may also be used on light aircraft to provide \"lighter\" stick forces, but on larger aircraft, the hydraulics are doing all the hard work anyway.",

However, they are not suitable for jet airplanes because of their large range of operating speeds, preference, for this type of airplane, is given to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer. There are two types of trim tab in common use: the variable and the fixed. The variable trim tabs may be manually or electrically controlled. If manually controlled, then trim wheels located on the center console are used. For the elevator trim if the tab is deflected up the cockpit indication is nose-down and if the trim tab is deflected down the cockpit indication is nose-up. To remain in trim and maintain level flight following a deceleration the trimmer control is moved to give a nose-up movement that causes the trim tab to move down, which makes the elevator move up. This does not affect the static longitudinal stability. The moment required to move the primary control surface to the required position (MM) is equal to the force (FM) multiplied by the length of the arm (Am) from the hinge of the elevator to the center of pressure of the elevator main control surface. The same moment can be applied to the elevators by a smaller force (FT) in the opposite direction generated by a trim tab multiplied by the longer arm distance (AT) from the center of pressure of the trim tab to the elevator hinge-line. In other words, (FM × AM) = (FT × AT). The trim tab thereby does the work required to maintain the elevator out of the neutral position and there is no need for any force from the pilot’s controls.",

The difference in lift between the two wings produces the necessary rolling moment. INBOARD AILERONS Ailerons are normally situated at the wing tips to give the greatest rolling moment for the force produced. However, this means they are also able to generate the maximum twisting loads on the wing. For instance, a down-going aileron will twist the wing tip and decrease wing tip incidence. The wing is not a rigid structure and any twist will cause a decrease of aileron effectiveness. As IAS increases, a down-going aileron will give more wing twist (decreased wing tip incidence). Eventually, an IAS will be reached at which the decrease in tip incidence will give a larger downforce than the upforce produced by the aileron. This is called high speed “aileron reversal”; the wing will go down, rather than up as the pilot intended. To reduce this effect, the ailerons could be mounted further inboard. Unfortunately, this would reduce aileron effectiveness at low speed. Alternatively, two sets of ailerons may be fitted: one set at the wing tips for use only at low speeds when the forces involved are low, and one set inboard for use at high speeds when the forces are greater and could cause greater structural distortion. Outboard (low speed) ailerons are “locked-out” as the flaps retract. At low speed both sets of ailerons work, but at high speed only the inboard ailerons respond to control input.",

If this stabiliser becomes jammed, then the aircraft will remain trimmed for a particular configuration/speed, and can cause serious problems when flying in other configurations/speeds. In this case, the pilot is trimmed for a low speed (forget flap settings for now because they make things overly complicated but don't change the answer), which means being trimmed for a high angle of attack. In reality, the basis behind trimming is actually quite complicated, but in essence, we trim to balance the aircraft at a particular angle of attack, which equates to a speed (there are a lot of assumptions in that statement but it's fine for this question). When we accelerate from that speed, the aircraft will provide too much lift and pitch up naturally, this is where we would usually begin to trim down to decrease the angle of attack, but without a working trimmer, we have to hold it on the elevator control whilst out of the trimmed condition. Without an elevator, the aircraft will continue to pitch up until it stops accelerating. If there isn't a separate elevator, then the aircraft will have to be trimmed with speed using thrust, faster makes it pitch up, slower makes it pitch down. The aircraft will attempt to hold the same angle of attack, which loosely equates to a speed. It can be flown like this, but it would not be easy. This question seems like there is a separate trimmer to the elevator, so that should not be necessary.",

To relieve the pilot of the need to apply so much force to operate the controls servo-tabs are fitted to carry out this function. The servo-tab is a small tab hinged on the trailing edge of the primary control surface and linked directly to the control column. There is no direct link between the control column and the primary control surface. The function and operation of the servo-tab is the same as the balance tab and moves the trim tab in the opposite direction to the movement of the primary control surface. However, at low IAS the servo-tab makes the main control surface less effective. The position of a servo-controlled primary control surface cannot be determined until a positive pressure is applied to the servo-tab by the airflow. In flight, if a servo-controlled elevator jams the servo-tab reverses the direction of the pitch control input, because the elevator becomes part of the fixed horizontal stabilizer and the servo-tab now acts as a small elevator because despite its small size it has a longer moment arm than the elevator and consequently generates a large moment. Under normal circumstances an up servo-tab position would drive the elevator to a downward deflection causing the airplane’s nose to go down, but if the elevator is fixed the servo-tab in an up position will cause the airplane’s nose to move up.",

Weight and CG location massively affect the handling characteristics of an aircraft. This is why most large jet aircraft calculate different pitch trim settings to use for take-off, depending on the position of the CG and the take-off mass of the aircraft. This is so the pilot can always feel roughly the same force when rotating the aircraft, and in the first phase of flight. If the aircraft has a far forward CG location, the nose will feel heavy to the pilot, so during the setup, the pilots will set a much more nose-up trim setting, so that at rotation, the feeling will be roughly the same. This is exactly what the question is referring to. Extra weight at the front of the aircraft will make the aircraft nose heavy, requiring nose-up stabiliser trim to feel the same. A nose up stabiliser trim is caused by providing extra downforce (or less lift force) on the tail. That is created by setting the horizontal stabiliser at a lower angle, with its leading edge pointing more downwards.",

The magnitude of the force is a product of the dynamic pressure (IAS) and the angular displacement of the control surface. Aerodynamic force can be changed by: - adjusting the camber of the aerofoil. - changing the incidence of the aerofoil. - decreasing lift and increasing drag by “spoiling” the airflow. Changing the camber of any aerofoil (wing, tailplane or fin) will change its lift. Deflecting a control surface effectively changes its camber. AILERONS The primary effect of ailerons is to provide roll control about the longitudinal axis A downward movement of the aileron causes an increase in the effective angle of attack and a corresponding increase in lift, whilst an upward movement of the aileron causes a reduction in the effective angle of attack and a decrease in lift.

            "explanation": "Instead of using elevators to change the angle of attack and camber of the tail plane, the whole of the tail plane lifting surface is constructed in such a manner that it has a mutable incidence or changeable angle of attack. This is known as the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

Please send any further exam feedback to us in the comments or via email to info@atplquestions.com, so we can correct any differences and verify the answer, thank you! There are two scenarios that this could be. Faulty autopilot or trim runaway. A faulty autopilot would be exactly as it sounds, the autopilot is inputting the incorrect command into the control system, and the feedback loop is not working correctly to fix it. The fix for this situation would be disconnecting the autopilot. Of course, the pilots must then be aware that the trim will be set massively different from normal, so the forces will be high upon autopilot disconnect. The other situation is a trim runaway. It is difficult to tell from the question whether this is the situation or not. A trim runaway is where the electric trim system of an aircraft continues changing the trim angle, without command from the pilots. It could be due to the trims themselves, or the trims commanded by the autopilot. It is then up to the pilot to choose whether to disconnect the autopilot or not, as leaving the autopilot running reduces the forces the pilots have to bear, but disconnecting could fix the problem entirely. We would say that as the aircraft is already struggling to maintain altitude, disconnecting the autopilot is the best bet, and the pilots can switch off the electric trim and use the manual one if the problem has not been fixed.",

An aft CG decreases the longitudinal stability and makes the airplane more difficult or impossible to control in pitch. The CG must always remain within the CG safe envelope to ensure that the airplane remains controllable in all phases of flight. The elevator trim or stabilizer trim setting must be preset to a value for take-off and initial climb that will ensure a minimum stick force during this critical stage of flight. Usually, there is a graph in the airplane performance manual from which the setting appropriate to the total mass and CG position for take-off can be determined. Factors that affect the stabilizer trim position for take-off are: CG position Take-off mass Flap setting In comparison with a correctly balanced airplane during take-off, the position of the stabilizer for a nose-heavy airplane requires nose-up trim from a decreased stabilizer angle of incidence.",

Pitot pressure is fed to one side of a chamber and static pressure to the other, which moves a diaphragm under the influence of changing dynamic pressure with airspeed. This causes “regulated” hydraulic pressure to provide a resistance or ‘feel’ on the pilot’s input controls proportional to IAS2, just as in a manual control. In addition, stick force should increase as stick displacement increases. An advantage of artificial feel is that it can be configured to provide envelope protection, which prevents the pilot over stressing the aircraft. The Boeing777 fly- by-wire system employs envelope protection. This feature of the artificial-feel system provides increasingly greater force when the aircraft is pushed to its limits.",

This also leads to more control difficulty due to a jammed stabiliser.

            "explanation": "FLY-BY-WIRE (FBW) Fly-By-Wire aeroplanes function differently to conventional aeroplanes in that the pilot or autopilot input is via a flight control computer. The computer translates this input into an aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. CONTROL LAWS - NORMAL LAW The Fly-By-Wire system was designed and certified to render the new generation of aircraft even more safe, cost effective, and pleasant to fly. Flight control surfaces are all : ‐ Electrically-controlled ‐ Hydraulically-actuated. Computers interpret pilot input and move the flight control surfaces, as necessary, to follow their orders. However, when in normal law, regardless of the pilot’s input, the computers will prevent excessive manoeuvres and exceedance of the safe envelope in pitch and roll axis. One of the PF's primary tasks is to maintain the aircraft within the limits of the normal flight envelope. Some circumstances, due to extreme situations or aircraft mishandling, may provoke the violation of these limits. Protections are intended to: - Provide maximum authority to the PF to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft performance in extreme conditions - Reduce the risks of over-controlling, or over-stressing the aircraft - Provide PF with an instinctive and immediate procedure to ensure that the PF achieves the best possible result. The normal law protects the aircraft throughout the flight envelope, as follows: ‐ load factor limitation ‐ pitch attitude protection ‐ high-speed protection. - bank angle protection ‐ high-angle-of-attack (AoA) protection One of the hard protections on the Airbus system, in normal law, is the stall protection. Without flight crew input, the F/CTL computers maintain the AoA equal to a defined value. The limits of the hard protection prevent the pilot from exceeding the designed flight envelope of the aircraft. The AoA can be further increased by flight crew input, up to a maximum value. The AoA will not exceed that maximum value, even if the flight crew gently pulls the sidestick all the way back. CONTROL LAWS - RECONFIGURATION LAWS Depending on the failures occurring to the flight control system, or on its peripherals, there are 3 levels of reconfiguration : ‐ Alternate law (There are two levels of alternate law : with and without reduced protections.) ‐ Direct law ‐ Mechanical ALTERNATE LAW - REDUCED PROTECTIONS - Load Factor Limitation - Pitch Attitude Protection - Low Speed Stability (Soft protection) An artificial low speed stability replaces the normal angle-of-attack protection. A gentle progressive nose down signal is introduced, that tends to keep the speed from falling below these values. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, stall warnings are activated at an appropriate margin from the stall condition. - High Speed Stability (Soft protection) Above VMO or MMO, a nose up demand is introduced to avoid an excessive increase in speed. The flight crew can override this demand. In addition, the aural overspeed warning remains available.",

This is known as the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). One of the advantages of a trimmable stabilizer is that the elevator will be in line with the stabilizer when the aircraft is in trim. This reduces drag, and maintains full control authority, i.e., full elevator deflection can still be applied in either direction, if required. As seen in the attached figure, an airplane trimmed for nose up would require the stabilizer to be deflected down. When the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed, it has no elevator deflection. The question asks to consider the reference as the TRAILING EDGE. In that case we can conclude that for an airplane trimmed for nose up it would require the stabilizer’s trailing edge to be deflected up.",

            "explanation": "At low airspeeds, for some airplanes, aerodynamic balancing is not considered necessary, however, as the airspeed increases it progressively becomes a necessity because of the increasing aerodynamic load on the main control surface. Towards the leading edge of the primary control top surface is pivoted a lever. The top of the lever is connected to the control column and the balance tab is connected to the same lever just above the pivot. Thus, movement of the control column is transmitted to the primary control surface but does not directly operate it. To ensure that the balance tab is only effective when it is required, the operating lever of the balance tab system is pivoted through a spring mounted on the elevator main control surface. This is the ‘spring tab.’ When the elevators are operated with at low airspeeds, the control column movement is fed directly to the primary control surface with no deflection of the balance tab so that there is no geometric movement between them. However, at higher speeds, one side of the spring is compressed and changes the geometric position of the balance tab relative to the main elevator control surface. The spring causes the tab to move in the opposite direction to the main control surface at an ever-increasing angle, which is directly proportional to the increasing airspeed. Thus, the spring tab assists the pilot by reducing the stick force required to operate the main control surface to a similar level for all airspeeds. At high IAS, the spring tab behaves like a servo-tab.",

This could lead to excessive deflection of the control surface and result in serious overstressing of the airframe.

The forces and effectiveness of the tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) are greatly affected by the effective angle of attack of the oncoming airflow. This is not just the relative airflow around the whole aircraft as this air has been somewhat affected by the main wing ahead. The effective airflow aver the tailplane is mostly determined by the downwash from the wing. The main wing works by deflecting a large mass of air slightly downwards as it leaves the wing, so as the aircraft speeds up, there is greater airflow over the wing and that greater amount of air needs slightly less downwards deflection. As long as the right momentum change occurs, the aircraft will have the same amount of lift to counteract drag. This means that the angle of attack of the main wing is reduced, the coefficient of lift is reduced, etc., but most importantly for this question, the downwash angle is decreased. The tailplane often operates with a completely negative angle of attack, partly from the design and partly from this downwash from the main wing, in order to produce downforce to balance out the aircraft force couples and keep the aircraft nose up. This decrease in downwash means that the airflow arriving at the tailplane is \"flatter\" than before, i.e. it has less negative angle of attack.",

Under Alternate Control Law, entered into after certain computer failures, the aircraft should handle almost exactly as in Normal control, but some protection features will be lost, including the possibility of losing autopilot function, dependent on the specific failures. In Direct Control Law, all protections are lost and flying control input is translated directly into movement of the control surfaces without calculation or correction. The final degradation is Mechanical back-up. The aircraft is flown in pitch through use of the pitch trim wheel and roll by a mechanical connection retained to the rudder pedals (through the secondary effect of yaw). It is designed to allow the pilots to maintain control of the aircraft, while restoring flight control computers, after a complete power interruption. In the event of computer failure on a FBW aircraft, some form of back-up mode is required in the event of total computer failure. For this question, the statement \"to the first level of degradation\", means degradation to the \"Alternate Law\", where some protections may be lost.",

This changes the moment from the aerodynamic surface acting on the aircraft, resulting in aircraft pitch, roll or yaw.

This happens because the deflection of the control surface changes the CL for the airfoil on which it operates. The effectiveness of surfaces operates through the lift formula (CL * ½ * ρ * V² * S). So, if CL increases, lift will also increase. In this question we are talking about a constant deflection, so CL will remain stable. Therefore, if we increase speed (v), lift will increase and so does the moment resulting from the control surface, increasing aeroplane manoeuvrability.",

            "explanation": "Control surfaces produce lift or drag. Lift and drag increase and decrease with increasing and decreasing speed. Therefore, only small deflections are necessary when flying with high airspeeds and larger deflections at lower speeds. The lift equation states: LIFT = ½ρV2SCL CL = coefficient of lift. This represents angle of attack of the airfoil and the shape of the airfoil. This described in terms of thickness/chord ratio and a camber and can be altered in flight, for example, by lowering the flaps. ρ = The density of the air. For any given altitude during subsonic flight, the density may be considered to be constant. V2 = The velocity of the aircraft, squared. S = The wing area. The lift formula can also be rearranged and written as: LIFT = q × S × CL (q = dynamic pressure, i.e. ½ρ × V2). In the lift equation all factors except density and speed (TAS) are constant. At higher altitude ρ is reduced; therefore TAS (V) must be increased to maintain the same lift (= weight). Drag equation states that: DRAG = ½ρV2SCD ρ = the mass density of the fluid (rho), V = the velocity of the object relative to the air, S = the reference area, CD = the drag coefficient - a dimensionless constant. The drag formula can be rearranged and written as: DRAG = CD × ½ρ × V2 × S From the drag equation it is clear that drag is directly proportional to the frontal area: if it increases by a factor of e.g. 3 the drag will be increased by the same factor.",

While the question does not explicitly specify, it is presumed to pertain to asymmetric flight. In this scenario, the live engine generates a yawing moment on the dead engine, necessitating corrective action. The pivotal response involves applying rudder input to counteract the yaw induced by the engine failure. However, employing the rudder creates a sideslip, leading to increased drag. The offset rudder also generates a lateral force, exacerbating the sideslip. To mitigate these effects, banking (ailerons) towards the live engine is recommended. This banking maneuver reduces the required deflection of the rudder to maintain the desired track and minimize drag. It's crucial to note that a maximum banking angle of 5° towards the live engine is specified. This limitation is imposed to prevent larger bank angles, which could significantly diminish the vertical lift component.",

This is known as the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). The advantages of this tail plane over a conventional fixed tail plane, with an elevator and trim tab, is that the trim is more powerful, it creates less drag, retains full elevator movement at extreme trim angles and is able to cope with a larger range of CG positions than traditional elevator trim tabs. The angle of incidence of an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the airplane’s trim system, which alters the jack datum setting. The position of a properly trimmed variable-incidence tail plane depends, most importantly on, the CG position, the airspeed, the thrust setting and on the flap/slat position. When correctly trimmed the elevator angle relative to the horizontal stabilizer is neutral and the stabilized speed is referred to as the ‘trim speed.’ Thus, the trim may be used to set the desired speed without having to hold the elevator out of its trimmed position. A tail-heavy airplane would require the elevator to be deflected downward, which when the variable incidence tail plane is trimmed has no elevator deflection; it is in the neutral position and the leading edge of the adjustable stabilizer is up. If it becomes jammed in the cruise position, when approaching to land select a higher landing speed and/or use a lower flap setting. When trimmed for a forward CG position (nose heavy) the stabilizer leading edge is lower than the trailing edge.",

Adverse yaw may be counteracted by any one of the following devices: slot/aileron coupling. spoiler/aileron coupling. differential aileron deflection. rudder/aileron coupling. frise ailerons.

The airplane will settle at a higher speed, which is presumably what the pilot wants (despite the \"power controls altitude\" mantra). When the line is too high, the airplane may even descend and accelerate more than necessary, until the aerodynamic moment balances out the thrust moment, but overall the condition is stable.

Positive camber means that a wing is thicker on the top end of the wing, than on the bottom if looked at from the chord. In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below the origin. The camber of an airfoil can be increased with the use of flaps.

            "explanation": "When density altitude decreases, the air gets \"thicker\", meaning that there are more air particles per cubic metre, and therefore more air particles will hit our aircraft and flow over its wings per mile flown. This would increase lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but descend in the atmosphere, the higher air density means that we have to fly slower to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is a decrease in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with decreased altitude. As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with a decrease in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the left, due to the decreased TAS for the same IAS at lower altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 2, moving to the left.",

Given other questions in the database which have been confirmed, we have decided to change the options to make one \"actually correct\", rather than the very questionable previous options, which were never fully verified. This question could have even been removed from EASA's database by now, but we also cannot guarantee that. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect of spoilers on the critical angle of attack is much more complex (and explained where necessary in different questions), and unpredictable, but EASA appear to say that it increases with spoiler deployment (opposite to how it decreases when trailing edge flaps are deployed). As far as we are aware, it could actually increase or decrease slightly in real life, dependent on the wing, spoiler size and location, and particularly the amount of spoiler extension. For this question though, mercifully, the answer remains the same. ANSWERING THE QUESTION The question asks about the angle of attack of the wing. When spoilers are extended, the lift decreases, so without any change to the angle of attack, then the aircraft will no longer be in equilibrium, so in reality, to counteract weight, the angle of attack of the wing has to increase. This agrees with our experience of flying jets, in when we extend spoilers, the aircraft pitches up slightly. The margin to the stall is a very vague term, as it could mean the difference between current speed and stall speed, but it is more likely to mean in terms of angle of attack, and in this case, would probably be the difference between the aircraft's current angle of attack and the critical angle of attack (AoA). When spoilers are extended, the actual AoA is forced to increase to maintain the flight path, and the critical angle of attack will either decrease slightly (according to some other sources) or increase slightly (according to EASA's other questions), but either way, the increase in current AoA will likely be much greater, so the margin to stall will decrease.",

Ground effect increases as an aircraft flies closer to the ground, so the lowest height would give the lowest induced drag. Obviously then, the highest induced drag would occur when at the greatest height above the ground. Ground effect is usually cited as taking effect at approximately half the wingspan of height (which would be 30 ft here), as that is when it becomes significant and noticeable, but as with everything in aerodynamics, it is not a binary effect (on or off), it is a gradual change, so the correct answer here is simply the greatest height.",

In case of positive camber, a wing will generate lift with airspeed, as the air on top of the airfoil will get accelerated more than on the bottom, creating a low pressure on the top and high pressure at the bottom. This is “pushing” the wing up into the air as the pressure difference wants to restore itself to 0 difference. In case of negative camber, the exact opposite happens and the lift coefficient for a certain speed is lower than for a positively cambered wing. A completely symmetrical airfoil will intersect the vertical axis of the graph at the origin (0). A positively cambered airfoil will generate more lift at the same speed (and therefore has a higher CL) than a symmetrical airfoil and therefore intersects the vertical axis above and left of the origin. A negatively cambered airfoil will generate less lift at the same speed (which translates into a lower CL at a certain speed) and therefore intersects the vertical axis below and right of the origin.",

            "explanation": "To understand the venturi effect, we must first introduce two conditions: The conservation of mass (Continuity Equation) and the Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem). Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation) The mass of air entering the pipe, in each unit of time, equals the mass of air leaving the pipe, in the same unit of time. The mass flow through the pipe must remain constant. The mass air flow 'm' is the product of the density, the area and the velocity: m= ρ*A*V Continuity equation: m1= m2= m3= ρ1* A1* V1= ρ2* A2* V2= ρ3* A3* V3=constant The continuity equation explains the relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area: The speed is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Conservation of Energy (Bernoulli’s Theorem) The total energy of an airstream comes in two forms: potential energy (static pressure) and kinetic energy (dynamic pressure). The total pressure of the airstream is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure and must remain constant, according to the law of conservation of energy. Thus, an increase in one form of pressure, must result in a decrease in the other. Dynamic pressure (q) is expressed by: q= 1/2* ρ* V2 Assuming the total pressure to be constant, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure vary inversely: If one increases the other decreases and vice-versa. As an airfoil (wing) moves through the air, varying changes in velocity occur on its surfaces. Air particles move around it in specific trajectories. These trajectories are called streamlines. Diverging streamlines mean a decrease in airspeed. Converging streamlines imply an increase in airspeed. In Conclusion: With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). If dynamic pressure decreases, static pressure increases. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. With an increase in section area (from station 2 to station 3), flow speed decreases, decreasing dynamic pressure (streamlines diverge). Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.",

Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind. Parasite drag is caused if an airfoil is moving through the air. It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag. Form drag arises from the shape of the object. The more streamlined the object, the less form drag is present. Shape and size are most important in the amount of form drag resulting. Form drag increases with increasing velocity, making it very important for high speed aircraft. Skin friction drag is caused by the friction of the fluid (in case of aircraft this fluid is the atmosphere) against the skin of the object moving through it. It is directly related to the surface area in contact with the fluid. Skin friction increases with the square of the velocity. Induced drag is caused when an object redirects the airflow. A wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference. This pressure difference is caused by the shape of the airfoil, causing the airflow on top to accelerate, creating a low pressure on top of the wing and high pressure below the wing. This pressure difference naturally wants to restore towards a uniform pressure, which creates vortices around the wingtip. These vortices are deflected downwards, this phenomenon is also called downwash. The induced drag decreases with airspeed (with a rate of 1/V2) and increases with angle of attack and increasing weight. In the image we can see that the two vectors (induced and parasite drag) create a resulting vector, the total drag. Where the induced and parasite drag vectors collide, we have the minimum drag speed (VMD); the speed where the total drag is the lowest. This leads us to understand that during an acceleration from a total stand still, the total drag first decreases up until the minimum drag speed and then starts increasing again.",

            "explanation": "Spoilers are aerodynamic surfaces that exist on the top surface of some wings, and are used for many reasons. They are primarily used to increase drag and \"dump\" lift. (If they are just for drag then they are called speedbrakes, but aircraft manufacturers do blur these distinctions). They are called spoilers because they \"spoil\" the airflow, sticking up into the airflow, causing a lift reduction similar to an up-going aileron and a similar drag increase to that of a split flap. Of course, the spoiled airflow is not as effective at producing lift, and the CLMAX of wings with spoilers extended is much lower, so the stall speed therefore increases. The effect on the critical angle of attack is much more complicated, however, and is not always easy to predict. As the spoiler pushes up into the airflow, the adverse pressure gradient over it (which usually causes the stall) is reduced and the airflow is re-energised, but the area behind the spoiler (most do not go all the way to the trailing edge of the wing) is automatically stalled after a small spoiler deflection, due to the gap created. So there are two opposing forces at play: Spoilers act a little bit like an up-going aileron, re-energising the airflow and increasing the critical AoA, The large stalled area behind the spoiler decreases the lift of the wing greatly, with an unknown effect on the critical AoA Therefore, it is difficult to say what effect spoiler deflection will have on the critical AoA. Some sources mention a slight decrease in critical AoA overall, but it appears that EASA have published other questions where the overall effect is an increase in the critical AoA due to spoiler extension, so we have stuck with this across all questions, as it seems likely that the examiner wants this answer (and feedback has agreed with this in the past). Of course, the real answer is certain to depend on the proportion of the wing, the size and location of the spoiler, and most importantly, the amount of spoiler deflection. As this is so complex, the examiner’s choice of answer is all that truly matters here. A big consideration for this question is the scenario. We are at the critical AoA and we raise the speedbrakes. Of course, we will begin to descend as the drag increases, unless we add thrust. if we don't do either of these things then the aircraft will quickly stall, but initially, assuming the angle of attack remains constant, the speedbrake extension should slightly delay the stall to a higher AoA.",

Consequently, lift will be even smaller at the wing tip, resulting in smaller induced drag, which prevents wing tip stall. Ailerons are generally located in the outer wing sections. As consequence of washout, the wing tips (aileron section) will be the last to exceed MCRIT which allows roll control to be maintained. In simple words: The purpose for washout is to control the stall characteristics of the wing. It ensures the root will stall before the tips to maintain aileron authority for as long as possible.",

The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the IAS where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). Flying at a slower or faster speed than VMD will generate more drag. Flying at a slower speed than VMD (back side), the aircraft will be in the unstable speed region. Any loss of speed will result in an increase in drag and further speed loss (which must be corrected by an increase in thrust). The sudden change to a tailwind (or a decrease in headwind) will cause a loss of airspeed.",
