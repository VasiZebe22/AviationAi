The Flight Management Computer (FMC) holds two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days to align with the standard revision cycle for navigation charts. Prior to flight, the flight crew can designate the active set, which the FMC employs for navigation computations. The maintenance department updates the contents of these navigation databases every 28 days. By the time the navigation chart revision date arrives, the new data is already integrated into the FMC and available for selection. Should pilots mistakenly switch navigation databases while on the ground or in-flight, it could compromise elements of the planned flight route, potentially leading to hazardous deviations in performance and navigation. In the best case, such an error may result in a flight plan discontinuity - this is typically flagged by multiple FMS warnings. However, there's also the possibility that the FMS can still adhere to the flight plan, albeit leading the aircraft along an unexpected path, causing both pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel to lose situational awareness. This scenario could potentially result in perilous close encounters between aircraft.",

If you encounter this question during your official exam, we kindly request you to inform us about it. MCDU INIT FUEL PRED PAGE The pilot uses this page to initialise the gross weight, center of gravity and block fuel, before starting the engines. The FMGC will stop using the pilot-entered block fuel and will compute its predictions based on the FOB indicated by the FQI computer after the first engine start. BLOCK: Crew may enter a block fuel for planning purposes. However, the FMS will take the fuel onboard from the fuel quantity indication system. After the aircraft is refuelled, the pilots should: - Check that the indicated Fuel On Board (FOB) corresponds to the Flight Plan - Check that if any imbalance is present, it is within the limits - compare the planned and actual uplift in mass (kgs or lbs). This will allow to identify any error or discrepancy that happened during the refuelling process. These discrepancies are generally limited by the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and if out of limits a maintenance action is due.",

The FMS (Flight Management System) is the main computer that the pilots use to interface with the aircraft's more complex systems. Before a flight, the pilots will spend many minutes checking through the various pages in the FMS, making sure the data is correct, and inputting things such as the route, weights, clearances, temperatures, etc. The pilots can input many of these items from the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) which is part of the briefing pack the pilots have before the flight. Some of this data, however, such as updated weights and centre of gravity locations, arrive on the load sheet handed to the PIC by the dispatcher. The values on the load sheet then have to be checked/inputted into the FMS to make sure that the weights and CofG limits are correct for the flight. There are also databases in the FMS, and these are comprised of the navigation database and the performance database. These both need to be checked. The navigation database must be checked for time validity and the performance database must be checked to see if it contains the correct data, for example if it pertains to the correct aircraft variant with the correct engines. The alternate airport routing would not normally be entered into the FMS, unless it was expected to be used soon after take-off, which of course would be a scenario where taking off is not advisable in the first place. We do not input destination weather on most systems (and certainly not before take off).",

Both FMCs are synchronized, which means that each performs its own calculations then exchanges data with the other through a crosstalk bus. The master FMC sends its commands to the autopilot, the flight director system, and the autothrottle/collective. Independent mode – Both FMCs are decoupled and there’s ZERO cross-checking between them. This mode is automatically selected by the FMS under certain abnormal conditions such as different database validity on both FMCs. Single mode – When one FMC fails, the remaining one supplies both sides: its onside peripherals and failed FMC’s peripherals.

A monitoring section is provided in the MCDU where you can actually check the accuracy and integrity of the GPS signal and select the desired position computation method. Autotuning – automatic tuning of the radio navigation frequencies. The autotuning function automatically tunes the radio navigation facilities based on the available signals in terms of geometry and strength.

            "explanation": "The Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) performs navigation functions and lateral and vertical flight planning functions. It also computes performance parameters and guides the aircraft along a preplanned route. The Flight Management (FM) part controls the following functions: - Navigation - Management of flight planning - Prediction and optimisation of performance - Management of navigation radios - Management of displays The Flight Management Computer (FMGC) computes its own aircraft position ('FM' position) from an IRS position and a computed radio position, or a GPS position. Each IRS computes a mixed IRS/GPS position called the GPIRS position. For this, each IRS can independently select their GPS source in order to maximize the availability of GPS data. If the GPIRS data does not comply with an integrity criterion that is based on a Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) and on the automatic detection of failed satellites, the FMS rejects the GPS mode and uses the radio position update. The flight crew can deselect/select the GPS position on the SELECTED NAVAIDS page, if necessary. Without GPS PRIMARY (GPS deselected or inoperative) the navigation accuracy is lower and is a function of ground radio navaid infrastructure or elapsed time since the last radio update. RNAV(GNSS) approaches may be performed, provided GPS PRIMARY is available and with AP or FD engaged. The flight crew may check the position computation using the POSITION MONITOR page.",
