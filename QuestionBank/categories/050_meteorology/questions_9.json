Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude. Strong inversions are known to happen in desert areas, such as Saudi Arabia, where the surface will heat up quickly during the day and cool off rapidly at night. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. - Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind => which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in Rate of Climb. The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground. - Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreases aircrafts performance leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air - which reduces the aircraft's rate of climb.",

Microbursts are short-lived, usually lasting less than 5 minutes, and they are relatively compact, usually affecting an area of 1 to 4 km in diameter. Flying through a Microburst 1. Imagine you're approaching a microburst at 80 knots. As you enter the vortex ring, you experience turbulence and a rapid increase in airspeed as you pick up a headwind. You start to climb as your performance increases. 2. As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft. 3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed. You're at a high angle-of-attack, and still descending. 5. You encounter more turbulence as you enter the final vortex. If you haven't already hit the ground, you may begin to climb again as you exit the vortex. => An airplane flying through a series of horizontal vortices generated by microbursts experiences alternating updrafts and downdrafts causing pitch changes without pilot input.",

Therefore it is a sudden, semi permanent change which can feel like turbulence when it does occur. Turbulence, on the other hand, is a temporary, irregular change in the speed or direction of a small \"pocket\" of air due to things such as thermal convection, mechanical eddy currents from the uneven ground, wake turbulence from other aircraft, etc. These are transient effects, and is not like the sudden, semi permanent effect of windshear. Note: Very heavy turbulence is not described as windshear, they are different phenomena, but can feel a little similar.",

It's important to note that at the top of the inversion, the wind direction can shift by as much as 90º, and the wind speed can increase by up to 40 knots. Additionally, aircraft performance is closely tied to density altitude, with temperature playing a crucial role. As temperature rises, density altitude increases, causing the air to become less dense. This, in turn, affects engine and wing performance. When climbing through an inversion, the temperature rises with altitude, resulting in reduced aircraft performance. This decrease in performance leads to lower thrust and lift as the aircraft enters warmer and less dense air.",

This develops a series of standing waves downstream from the barrier and may extend for hundreds of kilometres over clear areas of land and open water. The wavelength and amplitude of the oscillations depends on many factors including the height of the high ground relative to surrounding terrain, the wind speed and the instability of the atmosphere. Mountain waves may also be referred to as standing waves or lee waves. These are likely to form when the following atmospheric conditions are present: Wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge of high ground and no change in direction over a significant height band. Wind speeds at the crest of the ridge in excess of 20 knots, increasing with height. A marked layer of stability around the altitude of the summits, e.g. an isothermal layer or inversion, with less stable air above and below If the wave amplitude is large enough, then the waves become unstable and break, similar to the breaking waves seen in the surf. Within these 'breaking waves', the atmospheric flow becomes turbulent. Vertical currents within the oscillations can reach 4,000 ft/min. The combination of these strong vertical currents and surface friction may cause rotors to form beneath the mountain waves causing severe turbulence.",

There are other types of icing that can happen to an aircraft on the ground. In fact, hoar frost can be quite common, particularly if an airframe is very cold and the air contains a high relative humidity, allowing the water vapour to turn straight into ice crystals on the airframe by deposition (the opposite of sublimation).

If it falls through warmer air before reaching the ground, it can melt and turn to rain droplets. If it then falls through cold air again before hitting the ground, the droplets can become supercooled (which means that they are still falling in liquid state, even though their temperature is below 0ºC). Freezing rain is a rare type of liquid precipitation that strikes a surface and freezes almost instantly. Most favourable conditions for the formation of freezing rain: Temperature inversions (with continuous rain) - Rain falls from a cloud at a temperature just above freezing into air with a temperature just below freezing. (Warm air aloft) Warm fronts: continuous rain falling from NS ahead of a warm front, flying from the cold sector into the warm sector. Occlusions",

Dictated what size of super-cooled water droplets will be present in a given cloud and also in what quantity. In this case, it is true that Stratocumulus clouds primarily contain small sized water droplets. However, bear in mind that temperature is very important. Temperatures at the surface are quite cold in this case (close to 0 °C). The cloud top will typically exhibit the coldest temperatures in these clouds. When the temperature is just right, these harmless-looking clouds can surprise a pilot with some moderate or even severe icing while climbing or descending through them – especially at the top of the cloud where the concentration of super-cooled water droplets will be higher. The higher the concentration of super-cooled water droplets, the greater the intensity of icing.

Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.

Falling through cold air (between 5 000 ft and 2 000 ft), the droplets become supercooled. Freezing rain consists of raindrops that have become supercooled after falling from warmer air into air where the temperature is below zero, which happens between 5 000 ft (+7ºC) and 2 000 ft (-4ºC). Freezing rain increases the risk of severe icing.",

Cloud-to-air lightning: Referring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud. Cloud-to-cloud lightning: Happens when a negatively charged cloud finds a positively charged cloud and opposites attract. The discharge travels from cloud to cloud.

Freezing Rain can cause significant accumulations of clear ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Clear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.09.07.01.02: List the influences of the phenomena associated with the lower stratosphere (wind, temperature, air density, turbulence). In the stratosphere, which is the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere, starting at 36 090 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the temperature stays the same (isothermal layer) up to around 60 000 ft, where it then begins to gradually increase again. The lower levels of the stratosphere would therefore be around the region of 36 000 ft to 50 000 ft. Let's go through each option individually: A) \"Horizontal movement of air masses is much less than in the troposphere, therefore very little head- or tailwind is to be expected.\" The wind in the lower stratosphere is still plenty strong enough to cause significant head- or tailwinds. The jetstreams sometimes extend upwards above the tropopause, and therefore this answer is wrong. B) \"The air in the lower stratosphere is very dry. Therefore, there are very few clouds in the stratosphere.\" Indeed, the air is very dry in the stratosphere, especially as it is so cold, so cannot hold much water vapour at all. This, and the stability of the isothermal layer, make clouds very rare in the stratosphere. Correct. C) \"There is strong vertical movement of air masses and therefore more turbulence to be expected in the lower stratosphere than would be felt in the troposphere.\" The stratosphere is isothermal, and is therefore stable. Rising air therefore stops at the tropopause, and there is very little vertical movement of air above this point (in comparison to the troposphere. Therefore there is little turbulence in the stratosphere. D) \"The temperature in the lower stratosphere decreases with height. This leads to reduced fuel consumption and better range.\" As mentioned earlier, the temperature stays the same in the stratosphere until about 60 000 ft, where it gradually begins to become warmer again. The reduced fuel consumption and better range bit is actually correct, but for the wrong reason.",

They usually extend from the bottom of the valley up to the boundary-layer top. In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused. Above the inversion, wind direction and speed may change significantly. Consequently, when crossing the top of the inversion, strong windshear (from 30 to 50 kt) may be expected.",

This may be done by climbing above the ice forming zone or to descend and fly contact below the ice forming zone. The advisability of this course would depend on the ceiling and visibility along the route at the lower level concerned. In this case, the stratiform cloud is at the minimum safe altitude => therefore, a climb to a higher level should be considered. Do not remain in icing conditions any longer than necessary. For that reason, during climbs or descents through a layer in which icing conditions exist, plan your ascent or descent to be in the layer for as short a time as possible. Note: \"increase the speed\". Speed of an airplane affects accretion of ice. The faster an airplane moves through an area of supercooled water drops, the more moisture it encounters and the faster will be the accumulation of ice.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

An aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation => in this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runways close to a bearing of 270º - into the sunset. Runway 26 is very close to this, so would experience the same effect.

As this has not been reported, we know the visbility in the landing direction should not be below 1 500 m. It will be below 3 000 m though, due to the aircraft landing towards the setting sun.

A katabatic wind is what happens when the face of a mountain cools down, and then cools the air in contact with it. The colder air wants to sink, and creates a wind that flows down the mountainside into the valley below (if one exists). Very simply, this cold katabatic wind gathers in the bottom of a valley, creating what is called a valley inversion, where the air is cold at the ground level, but warms up as you gain altitude initially, into the air mass which has been displaced by the katabatic wind. It is extremely common for this to happen overnight in mountainous areas, and should be carefully considered, as it can reduce an aircraft's climb performance after take-off, which would be a bad effect in the region of mountains. Therefore, at the ground just after sunrise (the coldest time of day), we would expect the air in the valley to be colder than the air at 1000 ft, which means -1°C is the correct answer",

The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Clear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C. \"Snow\" INCORRECT. Snow is solid precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Remember that for airframe icing to form water must be present in liquid state. \"Cirrus Clouds\" INCORRECT. You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.",

            "explanation": "ICE CRYSTAL ICING Ice crystals phenomenon has only recently been identified as a serious threat to turbine engines. Ice crystals previously were thought to be harmless to airplanes because they will not adhere to the external airframe, and will simply bounce off the airframe without accreting. Nowadays, researchers believe that ice crystals can partially melt, due to compression effects, as they pass through the engine fan section, enter the engine core and create a film of moisture on relatively warm surfaces, such as the forward stator vanes. The moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout. Another possible cue to the presence of a high concentration of ice crystals at altitude is anomalous total air temperature (TAT) indications, which include the increase in outside static air temperature due to compression. Researchers believe that erratic and erraneously warm TAT indications are caused by ice crystals that build up on heated TAT probes and block the airflow through the probes.",

            "explanation": "If an indication of a temperature inversion is given as part of an ATIS, it means that it is quite a noticeable inversion. Inversions occur when the air gets warmer with increased altitude, so when warmer air is above colder air. This can happen for many reasons, due to night cooling, valley inversions, frontal activity, etc. An inversion is incredibly stable, meaning that there is very little vertical movement of air through the inversion. This means that little to no mixing occurs, and therefore, the wind velocity (speed and direction) below the inversion may be totally different from the wind velocity above the inversion, and the difference may happen over a very small band of altitude. This means that flying through an inversion has the potential for quite significant vertical wind shear (changing wind velocity with changing altitude). This is why information about them are passed to pilots, so they can expect the wind shear and make decisions based on it. Inversions can also have large effects on aircraft performance, and the aircraft performance will be better below the inversion in the colder air. To look at the options: \"The altimeter will overread the aerodrome elevation when the QNH is set.\" This is not correct, as the QNH pressure is set at aerodrome elevation, so will read the correct altitude when on the ground. The air is very cold so some temperature errors will exist when flying around, but as mentioned above, not when using QNH whilst on the ground. \"Reduced braking performance.\" The ATIS said nothing about a wet or contaminated runway, braking performance might be perfectly fine. \"Low visibility due to snow.\" The ATIS made no mention of snow. \"Low level wind shear.\" Correct. As mentioned above, the inversion may cause wind shear at low levels when passing through it.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Wings that are thin or have sharp leading edges are more efficient ice collectors. For this reason, smaller, thin airfoils may accrete more ice faster than larger, thick airfoils. => Therefore, severe icing accretion is most likely to occur in thin aerofoils and in the presence of large supercooled water droplets.",

            "explanation": "Clear air turbulence (CAT) refers to turbulence occurring in cloud-free air. Unlike convective turbulence, CAT is invisible and may lack obvious signs of its presence. Consequently, the associated turbulence can catch individuals off guard. CAT can be severe, leading to structural damage, physical harm to both crew and passengers, and even impairing crew performance to the extent that simple tasks like reading instruments become nearly impossible. While NASA is actively developing various programs to enhance weather forecasting, the remote sensing of turbulence, especially CAT, using satellites remains a challenge, limiting the accuracy of forecasts. During flight, the most reliable source of information on turbulence is the reports provided by pilots. It is crucial for pilots to report turbulence so that air traffic control (ATC) can issue advisories to other aircraft and provide requested information. Aircraft reports (AIREPs) are particularly valuable since they can indicate the presence of CAT if turbulence is reported by another aircraft flying along the same route. This information assists in determining the potential location of CAT.",

It lights up the cloud to look like the picture above. Cloud-to-air lightning: Referring to a discharge (or a portion of a discharge) jumping from a cloud into clear air. This happens when negative charged air particles become attracted to positive charges within a cloud.

The resulting airspeed fluctuations can also increase the risk of a stall, especially when the aircraft is close to the ground. Additionally, aircraft performance is heavily influenced by density altitude, with temperature being a key factor. Higher temperatures increase the density altitude, resulting in thinner air and reduced engine and wing performance. As the aircraft climbs through an inversion where the temperature rises with altitude, performance decreases due to reduced thrust and lift, thereby lowering the rate of climb. The temperature inversion inhibits vertical mixing, leading to light winds below the inversion and relatively strong winds just above it. This creates wind shear between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above, which can cause airspeed fluctuations as the aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion.",

Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice.

These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C Freezing Rain can cause significant accumulations of clear ice Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.

These currents draw in air from the surrounding areas, generating turbulence as the air is displaced. Additionally, the energy from the rising air within the cloud can propagate turbulence above the cloud. Beneath the cloud, the inflow and outflow of air produce severe turbulence at low altitudes, posing a significant risk, particularly with the potential occurrence of microbursts or downbursts, which can be life-threatening. Whenever feasible, it's preferable to perform lateral avoidance over vertical avoidance, using the airborne weather radar and visual cues to navigate around CB cells. Vertical avoidance may not always be viable, especially at high altitudes, due to reduced safety margins and performance limitations. When identifying a \"threat area\" such as a CB cloud, the flight crew should aim to clear it laterally by a minimum of 20 NM whenever possible. A larger margin may be necessary if the convective clouds are highly dynamic or have rapid build-up speeds. If the flight path intersects multiple convective clouds, maintaining a minimum margin of 40 NM from each \"threat area\" is recommended. \"Descend to FL280 to increase the margin for manoeuvring and avoid severe turbulence. Request help from ATC to find a safe path through the front, as they have better weather radar equipment.\" Incorrect. Avoid attempting to fly beneath a convective cloud due to potential hazards such as severe turbulence, windshear, microbursts, and hail. Descent toward the wider part of the CB should be avoided as it can lead to icing issues due to an increase in supercooled liquid water droplets. \"Climb to FL380 to fly above the cold front. Moderate to severe turbulence can be expected within the CB cells, but only light turbulence above the CB cells.\" Incorrect. If flying over a convective cloud cannot be avoided, a vertical margin of at least 5000 ft must be maintained. In this case, it would surpass performance limitations.",

Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing, because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process.

The fact that the supercooled drops spread back before freezing is especially dangerous because there is the risk of accretion of ice aft of the ice-protection equipment.",

Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance, leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air. SUMMARY: An inversion marks the boundary between layers of air having differing temperatures and to some extent density. This will result in an aircraft gaining lift, thrust and power when descending through an inversion with the reverse conditions when climbing.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear. TEMPERATURE RANGE TYPE OF ICING RIME ICE (Small supercooled water droplets Stratiform clouds) 0ºC TO -15ºC -15ºC TO -30ºC Expect moderate icing Expect light icing CLEAR ICE (Large supercooled water droplets Cumuliform clouds) 0ºC TO -10ºC May be found in CB’s at -25ºC Expect severe icing => Regarding this question, “dense layered” cloud means stratiform cloud, therefore, we can assume RIME ICE might occur. At -25ºC, we can expect light icing.",

It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost can occur in clear air. Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating). This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles). Hoar frost can occur: on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack. in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases: If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer. If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion. The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating. \"Haze is a reduction of visibility due to the presence of water vapour\" INCORRECT. Haze is an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure the clarity of the sky - it is not caused by water particles. \"Mountain waves are always accompanied by rotor clouds\" INCORRECT. Mountain waves are accompanied by rotor clouds only if sufficient moisture is present in the air.",

For that reason, icing will not be experienced between the freezing level (3000 ft) and 4000 ft. 2. It then falls through an area where the temperature is below 0ºC (from 3000 ft to the surface) => between that layer, the water droplets will become supercooled, meaning that they will remain in liquid state but have a temperature lower than 0ºC. - The most important factor for the build-up of ice on aircraft is the freezing of supercooled drops following impact with a cold aircraft.

Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

Nonetheless, the answer should be the same, as the scenario is almost exactly the same. Please let us know if you see these in the exam, and anything you can remember about the question(s) that you see, thank you! If an indication of a temperature inversion is given as part of an ATIS, it means that it is quite a noticeable inversion. Inversions occur when the air gets warmer with increased altitude, so when warmer air is above colder air. This can happen for many reasons, due to night cooling, valley inversions, frontal activity, etc. An inversion is incredibly stable, meaning that there is very little vertical movement of air through the inversion. This means that little to no mixing occurs, and therefore, the wind velocity (speed and direction) below the inversion may be totally different from the wind velocity above the inversion, and the difference may happen over a very small band of altitude. This means that flying through an inversion has the potential for quite significant vertical wind shear (changing wind velocity with changing altitude). This is why information about them are passed to pilots, so they can expect the wind shear and make decisions based on it. Inversions can also have large effects on aircraft performance, and the aircraft performance will be better below the inversion in the colder air. To look at the options: \"The possibility for a sudden reduction in visibility due to the blowing snow.\" The ATIS made no mention of snow. \"A sudden degradation of braking performance on the runway.\" The ATIS said nothing about a wet or contaminated runway, braking performance might be perfectly fine. The low air temperature has the opportunity to form ice from any moisture, but if the ground if dry then the traction should not be much less than normal. \"Possibility for low-altitude wind shear.\" Correct. As mentioned above, the inversion may cause wind shear at low levels when passing through it. \"The altimeter will over-read the aerodrome elevation.\" This is not necessarily correct, as if the QNH pressure is set at aerodrome elevation, the altimeter will read the correct altitude when on the ground. The air is very cold so some temperature errors will exist when flying around, but as mentioned above, not if using QNH. This is because the QNH is measured at the aerodrome elevation specifically so the elevation will show on aircraft altimeters when they are on the ground.",

Bases of the clouds typically have greater concentrations than tops of the clouds. As you can read above, Severe Icing can be expected in Nimbostratus clouds.

FZRA occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C.

            "explanation": "In flight airframe icing occurs when an aircraft flies through icing conditions. Icing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0ºC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0ºC, but they are still liquid. We call them Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze, adhering to the airframe in the process. This can form icing such as rime ice, clear ice, or mixed ice (a mixture of the two). This can occur in precipitation also, particularly when the air temperature or airframe is below 0ºC, where rain, freezing rain, or wet snow can adhere to the airframe or engines. In reality, the best option here is \"dry snow\", as dry snow is considered to be made up of solid ice crystals only, not any water droplets that could freeze onto the wing. Therefore, dry snow is very unlikely to adhere to the wing, unlike the other options. Even \"snow and rain\" has a higher chance of causing airframe icing than dry snow, as the temperature will be very close to 0ºC in this instance, and the airframe or air temperature may be intermittently below 0ºC, causing ice accretion. The other two options are obviously very likely to cause problematic ice accretion.",

The Ice Water Content (IWC) is a measure of how much ice is present in a certain volume (or sometimes mass) of air. It can therefore be measured in either g/m3. This is part of the \"Ice Crystal Icing (ICI)\" topic in meteorology. A high IWC is usually caused by tropical storms bringing a very large amount of moisture very high up in the atmosphere, where the air is less than -20°C, and that moisture will form ice crystals rather than supercooled water droplets. This can lead to the formation of Ice Crystal Icing within aircraft engines, and is the reason that we have to learn about this. The annex above caters mostly for standard airframe icing, but we must be able to recognise the danger of ICI in the top sections also, which contain the ice crystals. These tropical storms that bring high IWC are areas of extreme convective activity, and the region around the tops of these clouds (and within those clouds) is the most dangerous location for experiencing Ice Crystal Icing.",

In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. A hard and heavy layer of transparent ice is formed that spreads from the point of impact to areas further away on the structure. It may be difficult or sometimes impossible to completely remove this ice accretion using the aircraft de-icing equipment.

Therefore, it would be unnecessary to brief them without knowing they are present, and they primarily occur in clear weather, so can be seen and avoided if necessary. \"Fog formation due to moist air descending into the valley.\" Fog can form in the bottom of valleys, but this is due to the cold air from the mountainside flowing down into the valley, usually during the night. It is not something you can expect every time you fly into a valley, certain conditions have to exist. We do not have enough information to assume that this might be happening. \"Turbulence on the windward side of the hills due to up and down draughts.\" Whilst you can expect some turbulence on the windward side of a hill, it is primarily due to the air being forced upwards by the wind hitting the terrain, and therefore just updraughts. The airfield is also surrounded by mountains, so is on the leeward side of each mountain, not the windward side. \"Rotor turbulence which could lead to loss of control.\" Most correct. The rotor effects from winds going over mountains are incredibly common to observe, as they require a wind to be blowing, so happen almost all the time. They also form a lot of turbulence, particularly when the winds are strong, and are a good item to brief when descending into mountainous terrain.",

It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10°C and -10°C. Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning. While flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge The main effects of a lightning strike are: Temporary blindness of the pilots Minor airframe damage Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked Disruption to electrical equipment Note: Aircraft cointaining composite materials (which have not been made conductive) will be severely damaged by lightning strike.",

Strong winds combined with moist air can induce convective instability, leading to the development of Cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In regions characterized by rugged topography, this uplifting process can become quite vigorous, resulting in the generation of extensive cloud cover and vertical growth due to convective instability. Moreover, this can enhance the intensity of precipitation. The orographic lift phenomenon amplifies the concentration and size of Supercooled Large Droplets (SLD), thus flying through orographic clouds increases the risk of icing. In stable atmospheric conditions, the freezing level is positioned lower, and the severity of icing is heightened both upwind and downwind of the mountainous range.",

An aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation => in this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runways close to a bearing of 270º - into the sunset. Runway 25 is very close to this, so would experience the same effect.

However, we still believe that the correct option should be: (1) 10ºC; (2) 0ºC. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam. Thank you! Icing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0ºC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0ºC, but they are still liquid. We call them Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze, adhering to the airframe in the process. For this question though, we have very little information, so have had to take some of the \"edge cases\" into account. Icing can also occur when the water droplets are close to freezing, but still just above, as long as the airframe is colder than freezing. The slightly warmer water droplets will freeze upon hitting the colder airframe. In fact, this icing can be particularly dangerous, as it drips back over the wing very easily, forming clear ice. This can happen when the wings are \"cold-soaked\", and in some parts of the rain-ice triangle as well. This is why we have said that icing can form with outside air temperatures of 10ºC or colder, as we know that it occasionally can, and this is the classification of icing conditions for most operators/aircraft, but that is partly due to SAT vs TAT and RAM rise. We think this is on the \"safe side\", which is where EASA examiners usually sit on this kind of topic. Also to note, airframes at -40ºC would mean that the air is close to -40ºC also, and that is too cold to form airframe icing. You could argue this but it is inadvisable.",

Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing. The ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is 1. Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage. Clear ice forms in Ns, Cu and Cb at temperatures from 0 to -20 °C. It is the most dangerous form of icing because 1) of the speed at which it can build up on the aircraft and 2) it might be very difficult to detect due to its transparency.",

Learning Objective 050.09.01.01.09: Explain the influence of fuel temperature, radiative cooling of the aircraft surface and temperature of the aircraft surface (e.g. from previous flight) on ice formation. In this scenario, the aircraft has a very cold airframe, which will warm up quite fast during the descent and landing. The fuel, however, has a much larger thermal mass than the airframe, and will take much longer to warm up. This means that the wings are what we refer to as \"cold-soaked\", as they will be much colder than the surrounding air for a while. This can be a problem, even on a warm day, depending on the moisture content of the air. If the air has a high enough moisture content, then any moisture that touches the wing will condense immediately, but due to the wing being below freezing temperature, will actually turn straight to ice on the wing (known as sublimation, or deposition, depending on the country). This forms icing on the wing, most commonly in the form of frost, similar to hoar frost but sometimes it can look a bit like mixed ice, depending on the conditions. Therefore, it is very likely that there will be fuel frost present on the wings on the ground, and the drizzle will also be likely to freeze to the cold soaked wing in flight, making the frost worse. This may require the pilots to take precautions such as re-fuelling with heated fuel, or delaying departure, if it is deemed necessary.",

It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10°C and -10°C. Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning. While flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge The main effects of a lightning strike are: Temporary blindness of the pilots Minor airframe damage Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked Disruption to electrical equipment",

The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.

The feedback we have received was not clear enough to assume that they are only one question as different authorities can publish questions with different wording. We kindly request any further exam feedback that anyone has about these questions, thank you! In flight airframe icing occurs when an aircraft flies through icing conditions. Icing conditions are mostly present within clouds below freezing temperature (0ºC), where the suspended water droplets have not yet become ice crystals. These droplets are held in a \"supercooled\" state, in that their temperature is less than 0ºC, but they are still liquid. We call them Supercooled Water Droplets (SCWDs). When an aircraft flies through a cloud of SCWDs, some of them will hit the airframe (which is also below freezing temperature), and this will cause the droplets to freeze, adhering to the airframe in the process. This can form icing such as rime ice, clear ice, or mixed ice (a mixture of the two). This can occur in precipitation also, particularly when the air temperature or airframe is below 0ºC, where rain, freezing rain, or wet snow can adhere to the airframe or engines. In reality, the best option here is \"dry snow\", as dry snow is considered to be made up of solid ice crystals only, not any water droplets that could freeze onto the wing. Therefore, dry snow is very unlikely to adhere to the wing, unlike the other options. Even \"slush\" has a higher chance of causing airframe icing than dry snow, as the temperature will be very close to 0ºC in this instance, and the airframe or air temperature may be intermittently below 0ºC, causing ice accretion. The other two options are obviously more likely to cause ice accretion, particularly freezing rain.",

            "explanation": "Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure the clarity of the sky. Haze is primarily caused by particles in the atmosphere which scatter the sunlight. The increase in airborne particulates combined with specific (low) sun angles causes the slant range visibility to be reduced even further. An aircraft landing \"into the sun\" will experience significant haze related visibility degradation => in this case, greatest visibility deterioration will occur when landing on runways close to a bearing of 270º - into the sunset. Runway 26 is very close to this, so would experience the same effect. Worst cases occur around sunrise and sunset during the summer months at times of day where haze-reduced visibility may be exacerbated by the low sun angle. Note: This is a very common type of question to encounter, usually referring to sunrise or sunset in haze, and 3000m seems to be an EASA favourite for the prevailing visibilty measurement. We do sometimes see feedback stating a different value for the minimum visibility occasionally, 1000m for instance, instead of 1500m. It should be clear in an exam which is correct. Any further exam feedback on this question would be appreciated, thanks.",

In such conditions, the dry air above the surface allows long-wave radiation to escape from the atmosphere during the night, a phenomenon known as nocturnal radiation. As a result, both the surface and the adjacent air cool down. This atmospheric setup can result in the development of ground-level fog. However, the presence of clouds can impede or entirely halt this cooling process. Desert air, characterized by its extreme dryness, is prone to the formation of radiation inversions on almost any summer night. In the daytime, the sun intensely warms the ground and the adjacent atmosphere. However, as evening descends and the sun disappears below the horizon, the primary heat source vanishes. In response, the desert's sand rapidly releases its stored heat and undergoes a rapid cooling process. This immediate cooling effect extends to the air just above the surface, resulting in air temperatures near the ground dropping by as much as 15ºC within a matter of hours. This phenomenon of cold surfaces and warmer upper air layers constitutes what is known as a temperature inversion. It's important to note that water, with its superior heat-retaining properties compared to rock and sand, is notably absent in the desert environment. Consequently, in the absence of cloud cover and with minimal water vapor, there is no thermal insulation to prevent the rapid cooling of the desert environment and strong inversions will commonly form.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -15ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear. TEMPERATURE RANGE TYPE OF ICING RIME ICE (Small supercooled water droplets Stratiform clouds) 0ºC TO -15ºC -15ºC TO -30ºC Expect moderate icing Expect light icing CLEAR ICE (Large supercooled water droplets Cumuliform clouds) 0ºC TO -15ºC May be found in CB’s at -25ºC Expect severe icing",

CAT can be caused by the interaction of layers of air with differing wind speeds, convective currents, or obstructions to normal wind flow. It often develops in or near the jet stream (narrow band of high-altitude winds near the tropopause). Clear air turbulence tends to occur in thin layers, typically less than 2000ft deep, less than 20 NM wide and more than 50 NM long. CAT can form when a layer of air slides over the top of another, relatively slower moving layer. Eventually the difference in speed might cause waves and, in some cases, distinctive clouds to form. Jet streams can sometimes be identified by long streams of cirrus cloud formations. The turbulence associated with a jet stream can be very strong, and because it often occurs in clear air, it is difficult to forecast accurately.",

RERA: Recent Rain, which indicates that rain has been observed at the airport during the period since the last routine report was issued or the last hour, whichever is shorter. WS: Wind shear. A TORNADO is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually occurs as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air at high altitude, which comes from a different direction. It creates a very small (a few hundred meters maximum), extremely low pressure zone, with air circulating around it at incredibly high speeds, in the region of 200 kt. Tornadoes start as funnel clouds, extending downwards from the base of the thunderstorm, eventually reaching the ground and causing incredible destruction in some cases. The cores only move at around 10-20kt, but the wind speed around the core can reach over 200 kt. The circular air motion is key, as the air begins to \"orbit\" the core, getting continuously sucked inwards but missing the centre, so ending up circling the core. The other answers are referring to different meteorological phenomena, such as cloud formation (temperature close to dew point), tropical revolving storms (need a sea temperature of 26.5°C) and dust devils (small tornado style winds that pick up the dust off the ground).",

            "explanation": "A typical airmass thunderstorm consists of three states – initial stage (cumulus stage), Mature stage and Dissipating stage. CUMULUS STAGE/INITIAL STAGE Lifting action initiates the vertical movement of air Because of the strong updrafts (as great as 3000 ft/min), precipitation usually does not fall. Instead, the water droplets or ice crystals rise and fall within the cloud, growing larger with each cycle. The cloud reaches the mature stage in about 15 minutes. => This stage is characterized by continuous updrafts. MATURE STAGE As the water droplets in the cloud grow too large to be supported by the updrafts, precipitation begins to fall. This creates a downward motion in the surrounding air and signals the beginning of this stage. The down-rushing air spreads outward at the surface, producing a sharp drop in temperature, a rise in pressure, strong gusty surface winds and turbulent conditions. Within the thunderstorm cloud, the strongest turbulence occurs in the shear between the updrafts and downdrafts (below the cloud) As the thunderstorm advances, a rolling, turbulent, circular shaped cloud might form at the lower leading edge of the cloud => this is called a roll cloud. It can last up to 30 min => Thunderstorms reach their greatest intensity during the mature stage (which is signaled by the beginning of precipitation at the surface). DISSIPATING STAGE As the mature stage progresses, more and more air aloft is disturbed by the falling drops. Eventually the downdrafts begin to spread out within the cell – taking the place of the weakening updrafts. During this stage the upper level winds often blow the top of the cloud downwind, creating the familiar anvil shape. => Thunderstorms reach this stage when downdrafts become the dominant air movement within this cell.",

            "explanation": "The correct option describes the ideal conditions for Freezing Rain. Freezing Rain occurs when precipitation, in the form of rain, passes from a warm air mass into a relative cold air mass of an air temperature less than 0°C. The rain maintaining its liquid state in sub-zero temperatures renders it super-cooled. These supercooled water droplets freeze when they come into contact with the ground or other exposed surface, if the surface temperature is below 0°C. Now, freezing Rain can cause significant accumulations of clear ice. Clear ice is the most hazardous form of airframe icing. The raindrops spread and freeze on contact with a cold airframe. When the supercooled drop hits the airframe, it freezes relatively slowly due to the latent heat released in the freezing process. This allows part of the drop to spread backwards before it too freezes. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Clear ice forms a sheet of solid, clear, glazed ice with very little air trapped in it which can dramatically alter the aerodynamic properties of an aerofoil. There may also be a significant increased weight penalty associated with clear ice. \"Level flight in snowfall below a nimbostratus layer.\" INCORRECT. Snow is solid precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Remember that for airframe icing to form water must be present in liquid state. \"Flying in dense cirrus clouds.\" INCORRECT. You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe.",

Whether an aircraft flies in the stratosphere or not largely depends on the type of aircraft. Some airplanes, such as commercial jets, are better suited to flying at higher altitudes and it is also more advantageous for them to do so. Some of the reasons why it is advantageous for aeroplanes to fly in the lower stratosphere are listed below. FUEL ECONOMY. At around 35 000 - 42 000 feet, which is the altitude that commercial airliners like to operate in, a very low amount of oxygen is required for proper combustion in the jet engines. An airplane flying in the stratosphere uses far less fuel than at lower altitudes thanks to the lower air density and lower temperature. The air temperature drops 2°C for every 1 000 feet an airplane climbs – up to about 36 000 feet. This results in big savings for the airline and other operators. LESS TURBULENCE. Generally speaking, much of the weather phenomenon we see on Earth occurs in the troposphere, therefore an airplane flying in the stratosphere can avoid the bad weather that is typically found lower in the atmosphere. If you’ve wondered why you don’t see any clouds in the stratosphere it’s because the air contains very little water vapor, so clouds are unable to form. TIME EFFICIENT. At higher altitudes, the air is thinner (roughly thousands of times thinner at the top of the stratosphere compared to at sea level), which results in less drag. An airplane flying in the stratosphere can therefore, fly faster and a pilot will reach their destination more quickly.",

There are 2 general types of structural icing: RIME ICE Normally encountered in stratiform clouds. In these clouds, continuous icing can be expected in the temperature range from 0ºC to -30ºC, and results from instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets striking the aircraft’s surface. It has an opaque appearance caused by air being trapped in water droplets as they freeze. Because it freezes instantly, it builds up on the leading edge of airfoils and it does not flow back over the wing. CLEAR ICE Can develop in areas of large water droplets that are found in cumulus clouds or in freezing rain beneath a warm front inversion. In this case, the droplets flow over the aircraft structure and slowly freeze (they can glaze the aircraft’s surface). Clear icing is most heavily concentrated in cumuliform clouds (dense clouds) in the range of temperature from 0ºC to -10ºC. However, you can encounter clear icing in Cumulonimbus clouds with temperatures as low as -25ºC. In addition, supercooled water and icing have been encountered in thunderstorms as high as 40 000 ft, with temperatures of -40ºC. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice because it has the fastest rate of accumulation and is more difficult to remove than rime ice. Note: You are least likely to encounter icing in high clouds, because these clouds consist of ice crystals and this already-frozen moisture will not adhere to your airframe. Icing might also occur as a mixture of both rime and clear.

            "explanation": "On a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling - which can lead to windshear. Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind => which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in lift. The fluctuation in airspeed can also induce a stall precariously close to the ground. Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreased aircraft performance, leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air. SUMMARY: An inversion marks the boundary between layers of air having differing temperatures and to some extent density. This will result in an aircraft gaining lift, thrust and power when descending through an inversion with the reverse conditions when climbing.",

It is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. Hoar frost occurs in clear air. Water vapour in contact with the airframe is converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid (sublimating). This whole process required the presence of another type of ice nucleus – their composition is usually inorganic (ie. Dust, soil particles). Hoar frost can occur: on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. If frost is not removed from the wings before flight, it can cause an early airflow separation that decreases lift and increases drag. This causes the airplane to stall at a lower-than-normal angle of attack. in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases: If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer. If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion. The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.",

You also want to fly in a direction to reduce your diversion track, so if your track has a turn ahead, then you may want to take that into account. It is also important to increase the range of the weather radar sometimes to check you are not travelling into a \"thunderstorm valley\" ahead. In this question, then, the wind is from left to right, which means we should attempt to go to the left of the storm cloud (upwind of it), and our track also turns left ahead, which means turning left to avoid the storm is not going to add as many miles to our track, so is best.",

Mountain waves are very violent updrafts and downdrafts that occcur above, and downstream of, mountain ranges. In particular, the area insde and underneath a lenticular cloud contains extremely violent rotor turbulence effects, and should never be flown close to. When at only 1500ft above the maximum terrain elevation, the downdrafts from these mountain waves could easily overpower a piston aircraft's maximum rate of climb, causing potential terrain clearance issues also. Another problem with mountain waves is that they can, in the right conditions, continue upwards for tens of thousands of feet, up as high as the tropopause in some cases. This means that attempting to climb above them is a dangerous gamble, with potential for severe clear air turbulence, certainly not worth it, especially in this case. Sometimes the lenticular clouds will form in higher mountain wave layers, stacking up; sometimes they will not. If there are lenticular clouds around 9500ft, there will almost certainly be a lot of turbulence around 11,500ft also. This track from Barcelona to Castres goes over the Eastern Pyrenees, and if you were to go a few more miles East, you would be out of the mountain range area. This is not an excessive diversion to make, and so could be completed safely. If this was not possible, then turning back would be the best course of action.",

Ice crystals previously were thought to be harmless to airplanes because they will not adhere to the external airframe, and will simply bounce off the airframe without accreting. Nowadays, researchers believe that ice crystals can partially melt, due to compression effects, as they pass through the engine fan section, enter the engine core and create a film of moisture on relatively warm surfaces, such as the forward stator vanes. The moisture traps additional ice crystals, and, eventually, the ice buildup is shed into the compressor, causing the engine to surge and stall and possibly the combustor, causing a flameout. Another possible cue to the presence of a high concentration of ice crystals at altitude is anomalous total air temperature (TAT) indications, which include the increase in outside static air temperature due to compression. Researchers believe that erratic and erraneously warm TAT indications are caused by ice crystals that build up on heated TAT probes and block the airflow through the probes.",

Clear air turbulence is a remarkably difficult to detect as a pilot (until you are within it), as no radar returns will ever show it. Both airborne weather radar and ground radar pick up returns from particles in the air (hail, rain, snow, etc.) and can detect turbulence from the doppler shift as those particles move about a lot. Unfortunately, this does nothing to help us detect clear air turbulence (CAT), as, by definition, there are no particles to receive returns from, so RADARs will not pick it up. This is the same for satellite sensors, which also would not be able to pick up this invisible phenomenon. The absolute best way to receive information about CAT is through reports from other aircraft, as these give you a location and a strength of the associated turbulence in real time, very valuable information to use for turbulence avoidance. CAT can be forecast with varying reliability, as jet streams and similar wind patterns can cause it, but it is very much guesswork, and CAT can appear in unexpected places with no warning. It would certainly be difficult to pick up with a weather balloon, as CAT areas are isolated and the chance of the weather balloon ascending through one is small.",

Blowing snow can be falling snow or snow that already accumulated but is picked up and blown about by strong winds. It is one of the classic requirements for a blizzard. As an obstruction to vision, it is encoded as BLSN as an obstruction to vision in a METAR report. Drifting snow is only raised from the ground surface by the wind to a height of less than 2 m (6 ft) creeping, rolling and bouncing above the surface. While drifting snow is not regarded as a major vision hazard for aviation it is a major hazard for surface transportation (including taxying small aircraft). The visibility can be as low as 1m in drifting snow. Snow Grains are small grains of ice. They do not produce much accumulation and are the solid equivalent to drizzle. Snow Pellets are ice crystals that grow by supercooled water accreting onto them as they fall. They look like tiny hailstones, but are a bright white colour, and often have formed so quickly that they break as soon as they hit the ground. They can be up to 5mm in diameter, and can also be formed when snow and sleet melt, and then re-freeze.",

The amount of a supercooled water droplet that freezes on impact is 1/80th of the droplet for each degree below freezing. Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no air trapped under the flowback icing. The ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the build-up can be uneven. It is 1. Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, the pieces can be large and cause skin damage. Clear ice forms in Ns, Cu and Cb at temperatures from 0 to -20 °C. It is the most dangerous form of icing because 1) of the speed at which it can build up on the aircraft and 2) it might be very difficult to detect due to its transparency.",

Learning Objective 050.09.07.01.02: List the influences of the phenomena associated with the lower stratosphere (wind, temperature, air density, turbulence). Note: this is the first question in this section (stratospheric conditions) that has been ever been known to be examined by EASA. We expect that more similar questions may be added by EASA in future. With the question being so new, any exam feedback about it (or any similar questions) would be greatly appreciated, and can be sent to info@atplquestions.com or put in the comments, thank you. In the stratosphere, which is the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere, starting at 36,000 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the temperature stays the same (isothermal layer) up to around 60,000ft, where it then begins to gradually increase again. The lower levels of the stratosphere would therefore be around the region of 36,000 to 50,000ft This means that the lower levels of the stratosphere have decreasing pressure with height (the same occurs all through the atmosphere) but the temperature remains the same (warmer than it would otherwise be). In the troposphere, the reduction in temperature with altitude allows some density to be regained (as cold air is denser), but this does not happen in the stratosphere, meaning that the air density drops off quicker than it would in the corresponding troposphere. This also means that the stratosphere is also completely stable due to the isothermal nature of it. Let's go through each option individually: Stratospheric flight levels have lower density (therefore higher density altitude) than if it were the troposphere, which means that the jet engines can run at their peak efficiency, as they are effectively at a higher altitude. This compounds with the fact that the stratospheric flight levels are high up anyway, giving them very efficient flight characteristics even without the effect of the isothermal layer. The reduced density also gives a higher TAS when flying at a constant IAS, and the warmer temperature means that TAS will be higher when flying at a constant Mach number (which is much more likely). Emissions within the stratosphere have been studied to have a different impact on the environment, but not necessarily less of an impact. Mountain waves can extend well into the stratosphere in some cases, and EASA formally recognise that as part of the mountain waves syllabus. There will be less clouds in the low stratosphere, as cloud form due to uplift (mostly) which does not occur, and the isothermal layer is completely stable. There are some rare clouds that do occur (noctilucent, polar stratospheric, etc.), as well as the peaks of some violent CBs that penetrate the tropopause with their high upwards momentum. Less wear on the engines is not true, as the engines will have to spin at a higher RPM to maintain thrust output in the low density air (which is actually more efficient), but will cause more wear due to the high rotational speeds. Less turbulence is probably the easiest one to work out of this whole selection, as this is what the stratosphere is best at, producing low turbulence, stable conditions.",

This happens on clear afternoons in summer over land, when the heating of particular patches of ground cause significant thermal uplift, a parcel of air large enough, and with enough moisture to form a heavy cloud brings about what is known as an air mass thunderstorm.

At very low temperatures, the water vapour turns directly into solid ice crystals by deposition (often referred to as \"sublimation\" in meteorology). Engine surfaces and pitot tubes are affected. Several engine power-loss and damage events have occurred in convective weather above the altitudes typically associated with icing conditions. Research has shown that strong convective weather (thunderstorm activity) can lift high concentrations of moisture to high altitudes where it can freeze into very small ice crystal. Ice crystals do not adhere to cold airframe surfaces because the ice crystals bounce off. However, the crystals can partially melt and stick to relatively warm engine surfaces. It has also been noted that ice crystals impacting heated windscreens can result in pilots observing “rain” as the crystals rapidly melt on contact with the heated windscreen. The main risk of encountering high crystal concentrations appears to be downwind from the tops of large areas of convective cloud - the area where the visible anvil shape is seen when viewed from a distance.",

The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.",

It is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. Temperature between +10°C and -10°C. Lightning typically strikes a relatively sharp edge of a plane, like a wingtip or nose, and the current exits via the tail - becoming part of the lightning trajectory. This happens because an aircraft's fuselage, or body, acts as a Faraday cage (a container that blocks electromagnetic fields). In short, lightning strikes are not a severe problem from a safety standpoint. When air operators route around stormy areas, it is to prevent turbulence or possible external damage caused by things like hail rather than to avoid lightning. While flying through air that is electrically charged the aircraft is likely to become a charge carrier itself and can initiate a lightning discharge The main effects of a lightning strike are: Temporary blindness of the pilots Minor airframe damage Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked Disruption to electrical equipment",

Please let us know if you see it in the exam, thank you! Given that the pilot is likely well out of line of sight range of the destination, picking up the normal ATIS over VHF is impossible. The options from here would be: Use a VOLMET. This will only work if the airport is part of a particular VOLMET broadcast, but most large airports are, and it is the best answer here. VOLMETs can be listened to over VHF or HF radio, depending on the specific VOLMET tuned. HF VOLMETs allow for even greater ranges than VHF signals. Request the weather information from ATC. Whilst this can be done, it is not the preferred method, as the frequency would then get blocked for a while whilst this information was passed to the aircraft, and is extra work for the controller who may already be incredibly busy. It is usually only done in urgent or emergency situations, or when no other means are available. Get a D-ATIS. This is a Digital/Datalink ATIS, and you can get this using SATCOM (satellite communications), which will show up the ATIS on screen, or print it out in the flight deck. This is not available in the given options though.",

The correct answer is therefore \"Thunderstorms may occur in the summer months over central Europe\". With low pressure systems, warm soil (= rapidly rising warm air) and light winds, thunderstorms are likely to occur.

            "explanation": "The explanation figure has a couple of cities not in their precise locations. They are not far enough off to make any difference so there is no need to adjust them. For this question it is easiest to go through each option: \"On a flight from Zurich to Rome you do not have to worry about any moderate and/or severe turbulence at FL 150.\" INCORRECT. As you can see in the attached chart, the first part of the flight between Zurich and Rome will be across an area where moderate turbulence and icing are forecasted from a level below FL100 (XXX here means below the lowest level of the chart) up to FL180 => which means that at FL150 we can expect moderate turbulence. \"Between Paris and Amsterdam, moderate icing conditions are forecast above FL140.\" INCORRECT. The entire flight between Paris and Amsterdam will be in an area where moderate turbulence and icing are forecasted from a level below FL100 up to FL140 => moderate icing is not forecasted for a level above FL140. \"The wind speed in the core of the jet stream just to the west of Rome is approximately 80 kt.\" CORRECT. The jet stream just to the West of Rome is ending, and therefore that final section of the jet stream is just over 80 kts in the core (and decreasing), as this is the criteria for showing as a jetstream on this chart. Therefore, at the points where jet streams start and end on these charts, the core must have a wind speed of 80 kts somewhere in that region. \"Moderate, occasionally severe turbulence can be expected over Frankfurt at FL290.\" INCORRECT. Do not be tricked by this one. Even though it could appear that Frankfurt is in CAT area 2 - it is not. Frankfurt is located in CAT area 4 - and in this area, only moderate turbulence is forecasted between FL180 and FL420. No severe turbulence is expected.",

This means the lines are points of equal height (isohypses) and the higher the pressure level is (the further that pressure level is from MSL), the higher the pressure is in that region. It is a better way for meteorologists to plot upper winds and high altitude pressures, but for all we care, it acts very similar to a surface pressure chart. The wind circulates anticlockwise around a low, and clockwise around a high in the Northern Hemisphere. The closer the isobars/isohypses, the higher the wind speed. With regards to this question, We can see that this question depicts a situation in the Northern Hemisphere, in Paris. Now, notice the wind arrow on the lower right side of \"A\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from the Southwest, therefore indicating an anticlockwise direction => which means that it is a low pressure area. This means we can label the isohypses in our mind, and give each one an arbitrary number, if necessary, to indicate its height or pressure. All we are looking to do is to work out if B is higher or lower pressure than A, so we have labelled it as if it were a surface pressure chart, for ease. The values don't matter, only the relationship. We can see that the left hand pressure system is a low, and following the wind along the isobars/isohypses, that the right hand pressure system is also a low, and is a deeper low. By counting the isobars away from the left hand side and towards the right, we can see that the point B lies at a lower pressure area than the point A. \"High to low, beware below\", and therefore the true altitude of the aeroplane is higher at A and lower at B. Neither of the options regarding the wind speed are correct given that the closer the contour lines, the higher the wind speed.",

When the front is overhead “V”, wind veers (from a south-westerly direction to a westerly direction).

The most suitable option remaining is \"every minute.\" It's worth noting that the following information is not part of the syllabus but may be of interest: The Terminal Weather Information for Pilots System (TWIP) is accessible to pilots and dispatchers through the ARINC Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data link services. During adverse weather conditions, when a specific level of precipitation or wind shear is detected within a 15-mile radius of the terminal area, TWIP products are updated once every minute for text messages and once every 5 minutes for character graphic messages. During favorable weather conditions (below the predetermined precipitation or wind shear parameters), each message is updated every 10 minutes. Considering the additional information provided, it reinforces the conclusion that \"every minute\" is the expected answer from the examiner.",

A knowledge of the radar principle is paramount in order to accurately tune this system and interpret the weather radar display correctly.

The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity.

Advantages: easy to interpret, the clouds look the same as in real life. Disadvantage: not available continuously, due to the lack of sunlight at night. Clouds are represented in white, the land grey and the sea black. INFRARED (IR) – The temperature of the cloud will determine the wavelength of radiation emitted from the cloud, which can then be displayed. Advantages: available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will about the same by day and by night. Disadvantage: If the clouds near the surface are approx. same temperature as the land surface it can be difficult to distinguish the clouds from land. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. Together, they can give us a good idea of what clouds are present. In this case, the band of clouds is very white on the IR image, so we know that the cloud tops are very cold (high in the atmosphere). Also, the visible image shows us that the clouds are thick enough to obscure the land below, and not wispy like cirrus clouds might be. This means that the clouds are thick, with good vertical extent, so they must be cumulus/cumulonimbus clouds.",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

If anyone sees either questions in their exams, please inform us in the comments, or alternatively, you can email your feedback to info@atplquestions.com or put it in the \"question feedback\" section of your dashboard, thank you! RVR is a special measure of visibility in the direction of the runway. As prevailing visibility is usually used, which is approximately the average visibility in all directions from the station, this can be a bit inaccurate, as the visibility can vary massively between two different directions, due to different density of obscuration, perhaps. This is why, when the visibility is below 1500 m, the RVR is reported also, as the RVR (Runway Visual Range) is a measure of the exact visibility directly down the runway, and usually is measured at 3 different places on the runway, touchdown zone, midpoint, and stop-end. This is almost always higher than the prevailing visibility, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers). In terms of this question, the runway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of centreline markings or lights that can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so those two answers must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is the runway edge lights, which you should be able to see also. The other options are either to the side of the runway (in a direction where visibility is not assured), or behind the aircraft when lined up. Again, we are not sure about some of the options here, due to lack of feedback.",

Ground weather radars are similar to airborne weather radars. They operate using the same system of pulses and returns, including the use of doppler shift to calculate directions in some cases. They are dotted around many European countries to provide a good coverage, and indicate areas of precipitation, as well as the intensity of that precipitation. If you think about it, they are a very simple system. All they can do is beam out pulses and see which return, how strong the returns are and how far away they are returning from. They cannot measure visibility or obscurity (which are pretty much the same thing) as they are set up to measure precipitation, so are the wrong wavelength for tiny dust or water particles to provide returns. The returns also differ depending on the precipitation, but they can certainly measure differ intensities of precipitation, usually using the standard green-yellow-red colour scheme that we are familiar with.",

Sometime between 12:00 to 15:00 UTC, the visibility will continue to improve to 3 500 m and haze is to be expected. However, the METAR at 09:10 UTC states that poor visibility and fog have persisted longer than expected. Probably the OVC layer which was not forecasted has delayed the process of fog dissipation.",

            "explanation": "The word VOLMET derives from the French words \"vol\" (flight) and \"météo\" (weather). The purpose of a VOLMET broadcast is to provide weather information to aircraft in flight. VOLMET reports are broadcast principally over high frequency (HF) radio by a number of civil and military stations located around the world. This global network is divided into regions with each region having a number of VOLMET broadcast stations which all broadcast on the same frequency(s). In some regions, such as Europe, there are also a number of stations which provide VOLMET broadcasts on very high frequency (VHF) radio. In both cases, the station will use automated voice transmission to broadcast TAF, SIGMET and METAR information for a published list of aerodromes. VHF stations normally broadcast their information in a continuous loop updating the information as changes occur. HF VOLMET stations generally broadcast on a published schedule with five minute intervals allocated to each station, thus preventing overlapping transmission on the same frequency. A listing of VOLMET broadcasts by provider, inclusive of broadcast time, frequency(s) and a list of aerodromes for which information is provided, can be found in the appropriate en-route supplements for the region in question. With the ever increasing availability of SATCOM and Data Link equipment such as ACARS, the reliance on VOLMET is diminishing. None the less, it is anticipated that VOLMET stations will continue to broadcast inflight weather information in the coming years.",

Utilize a ruler to measure the distance between the 1 012 hPa and 1 016 hPa isobars at this location. Locate the geostrophic wind scale, usually found in the top left corner of the surface pressure chart. Commencing from the left side of the geostrophic wind scale, project the measured distance onto the 45°N latitude (between the 40°N and 50°N horizontal lines). You'll observe that the end of the measured distance falls slightly to the left of the 40 kt curved line. Therefore, we can deduce that the speed of the geostrophic wind at position 45°N 030°W is slightly greater than 40 knots. For determining the wind direction: At position 45°N 030°W, draw a straight line parallel to the 1 012 hPa and 1 016 hPa isobars. According to Buys Ballot's Law, in the Northern Hemisphere, the lower pressure is on our left when we have our back to the wind. Thus, we can conclude that the geostrophic wind at position 45°N 030°W is blowing from the southwest. Based on the preceding information and the available choices, we can assert that the geostrophic wind at position 45°N 030°W is roughly 210º/45 kt.",

For example, the 500 hPa level corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations). Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed),then we can assume a low pressure. Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts. The closer the contours the stronger the wind. Circulation of air around a High and Low Pressure system: In the Northern Hemisphere: - The air moves anticlockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Clockwise around a high pressure centre. In the Southern Hemisphere: - The air moves clockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Anticlockwise around a high pressure centre. With regards to this question, We can see that this question depicts a situation in the Southern Hemisphere, in Melbourne. Now, notice the wind arrow on the upper left side of \"A\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from Southwest - Northeast, therefore indicating an clockwise direction => which means that both are low pressure areas. The tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations, wider spaced isohypses show higher elevations => by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the contours at \"A\" are closer than at \"B\", therefore true altitude is higher over \"B\" than \"A\".",

Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. => Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water. In some modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence. => This function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence.",

Any spot on the globe will experience a southbound pass of the satellite in the morning and a northbound pass in the afternoon or evening. Although picture definition is good, polar orbiting satellites do not give a continuous view of the weather. Geostationary satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, so the satellite appears to remain in the same part of the sky when viewed from the ground. These orbits are much higher than polar orbits (typically 36,000 km) so the satellites travel more slowly, at speeds of around 3 km/s. Picture definition may not be as good as Polar orbitting satellites images, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles. 1 The pictures from geostationary weather satellites are generally of higher resolution than the pictures from satellites in a polar orbit.

            "explanation": "There are two types of satellite - the Polar Orbiting and the Geostationary: Polar orbits take the satellites over the Earth’s poles. The satellites travel very close to the Earth (usually between 820 and 970 km above sea level), covering a band 1500 NM wide. Any spot on the globe will experience a southbound pass of the satellite in the morning and a northbound pass in the afternoon or evening. Although picture definition is good, polar orbiting satellites do not give a continuous view of the weather. Geostationary satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, so the satellite appears to remain in the same part of the sky when viewed from the ground. These orbits are much higher than polar orbits (typically 36,000 km) so the satellites travel more slowly, at speeds of around 3 km/s. Picture definition may not be as good as Polar orbitting satellites images, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles. I. A Polar Orbiting satellite is able to take a higher resolution image, compared with a Geostationary satellite. CORRECT. II: A Geostationary satellite orbits at a higher altitude than a Polar Orbiting Satellite. CORRECT.",

            "explanation": "FEW CONSIDERATIONS: Firstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere => this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations). Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed),then we can assume a low pressure. Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts. The closer the contours the stronger the wind. Circulation of air around a High and Low Pressure system: In the Northern Hemisphere: - The air moves anticlockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Clockwise around a high pressure centre. In the Southern Hemisphere: - The air moves clockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Anticlockwise around a high pressure centre. With regards to this question, We can see that this question depicts a situation in the Northern Hemisphere, in Paris. Now, notice the wind arrow on the lower right side of \"A\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from a Southerly direction, therefore indicating an anticlockwise direction => which means that both are low pressure areas. The tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations, wider spaced isohypses show higher elevations => by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the contours at \"B\" are closer than at \"A\", therefore true altitude is higher over \"A\"/Paris than \"B\". Furthermore, as we have discussed, the contour lines are closer together at \"B\" than at \"A\"/Paris so the wind is stronger at \"B\" than at \"A\"/Paris",

Note: This question has not yet been verified, and given how poor the options are, it could very easily be different in the real exam. We would prefer a correct answer of \"Longitude, latitude and height (or pressure)\" to make it actually correct. Gridded forecasts are excellent tools to enhance weather forecasting globally, and to be able to get weather forecasts for areas of the world where it would otherwise be unknown or very difficult to forecast. Furthermore, their integration with each other, with aircraft systems, pilot reports, and other meteorological observations (radiosondes, etc.) make them a tool which will continue to get more accurate as technology advances. They use a 3D grid of latitude, longitude and height (or pressure). Given that height has not been mentioned in any of the options, the next best option is just \"height or pressure\" in our opinion. Time is very important, but it is not put on an axis of its own when presenting the data, so we are assuming it is not correct.",

This is one of three very similar questions (505494, 506338 and 507458), and this is the only version that we see as 100% correct. ICAO annex 3 defines RVR as follows: Runway visual range (RVR). The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. In METARs, the RVR values are prefixed by the letter “R”, followed by the runway number for which the RVR value applies and the actual RVR value. ICAO dictate that RVR should be measured in metres, but some countries (like the USA) may choose to differ from this as long as they notify ICAO as such. For instance, The United States FAA dictate that there, RVR shall be measured in feet and reported in 100 ft intervals.",

This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. The aircraft is most likely climbing after take off or approaching to land when passing through the inversion, which means that the airspeed is most probably slow - only a few knots greater than stall speed. The fluctuation in airspeed can induce a stall precariously close to the ground. \"that the performance of the engine will be reduced from inversion level down to ground.\" INCORRECT. Below the inversion, temperature will decrease and pressure increase with decreasing altitude => engine performance will increase. \"for fog below the inversion.\" INCORRECT.

A knowledge of the radar principle is paramount in order to accurately tune this system and interpret the weather radar display correctly. Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. For example, a water particle is five times more reflective than an ice particle of the same size.",

The Wind and Temperature Chart is a map of a region of the world that shows, in a general view, the forecast of the direction and intensity of the wind and the temperature in a given altitude. The figures next to the wind barbs represent the forecasted temperature at that point and altitude. To determine the ISA temperature deviation at FL110 and FL180, in order to calculate the ISA deviation at FL150, we need to first calculate the ISA temperature at these levels: At FL110: ISA temperature = 15 - 2 x 11 = -7ºC At FL180: ISA temperature = 15 - 2 x 18 = -21ºC The actual temperature at FL110 is +9ºC, which means it is 16ºC warmer than the ISA temperature. The actual temperature at FL180 is -9ºC, indicating it is 12ºC warmer than the ISA temperature. Based on the calculations, the ISA deviation falls approximately between ISA+12ºC and ISA+16ºC. The only available option within this range is ISA+14ºC.",

The air pressure is slightly higher than that of the low-pressure (depression) regions, but lower than that of the high pressure (anticyclonic) regions. Weather can be unsettled and can go for the worse or clear up, the winds are relatively calm and varying in direction. Trough = Extended region of a low-pressure system. Troughs may be at the surface, or aloft, or both under various conditions. Most troughs bring clouds, showers, and a wind shift, particularly following the passage of the trough. Troughs are very often associated with the fronts of polar front depressions. The weather associated with a trough will be similar to that of the depression/low pressure area. If they are not marked, troughs may still be identified as an extension of isobars away from a low-pressure system. They are often V-shaped Ridge = Extended region of a high-pressure system. The ridge originates in the centre of an anticyclone. The phenomenon is the opposite of a trough. Ridges of high pressure are indicated by isobars extending outwards from an anticyclone and always rounded, never V-shaped as seen in a trough. In case of this specific question: We can see that the pressure system at D lays between a high-pressure system east and west, and that there is a low-pressure system to the north and south. Because of this we can say that the pressure system at position D will be a col.",

These broadcasts utilize plain language to provide the most recent weather reports and forecasts, delivering METARs, TAFs, and SIGMETs in spoken form. They sequentially transmit weather information for various aerodromes. VOLMET broadcasts on VHF contain information from METAR, SPECI, and TREND reports. VOLMET broadcasts on HF consist of weather messages such as METAR, SPECI and TREND as well as (based on regional agreements) TAF and SIGMET. Therefore, its content is similar to these messages.",

After the change occurs, the following conditions are to be expected: 23016KT = wind 230º at 16 kt 4500 = visibility 4500 m RA = moderate rain SCT030 = scattered clouds at 3000 ft OVC050 = overcast layer at 5000 ft From the above decoded TAF, we can see that the wind is gradually backing whilst the wind speed is increasing (250º/6kt - 230º/16 kt). Visibility deteriorates (from 8 km down to 4.5 km) due to moderate rain - most probably falling from Nimbostratus clouds. An overcast layer is also forecasted between 1300 UTC and 1600 UTC => typical conditions for an approaching warm front. The only airports situated ahead of a warm front are: EDDL and LFPO. \"LFPO\" is INCORRECT. Note that the map is valid for 0600 UTC and rain only starts at 1300 UTC (according to the TAF). At 0700 UTC, this airport would definitely be situated in the rain belt of the warm front and, therefore, rain should be in the forecast (for 0700 UTC) => and it is not. Furthermore, overcast layer of clouds would be expected just ahead of the warm front, with relatively low cloud bases. Instead, \"no significant clouds\" are forecasted for 0700 UTC. \"EDDL\" is CORRECT. Considering the TAF, we can expect the warm front to be quite far away from the airport at 0600 UTC. We can expect EDDL to be situated in the rain belt of the warm front at around 1100 UTC - it makes sense that rain is in the next forecast (for 1300 UTC), along with overcast clouds.",

Blue line: cold front associated with the low pressure system. Remember that a cold front is always drawn on the warm side of the frontal zone, so most of the frontal clouds appear just behind the front, as the cold airmass wedges under and lifts the warmer air ahead of it. Cold fronts usually extend quite far south from low pressure systems. Red line: warm front associated with the low pressure system. Remember that the warm front is also always drawn on the warm side of the frontal zone, so a lot of the clouds appear ahead of it, as the warm air rises up slowly over the cooler air ahead of it. Purple line: occluded front, which extends from the junction of the warm and cold fronts back towards the low centre. Occlusions typically occur where the cold airmass has caught up with the warm air and is under-riding it, so clouds also appear just ahead of the front.",

Satellites can be Polar Orbiting, covering the entire Earth and passing above or nearly above both poles, or Geostationary satellites, hovering over the Equator. There are two methods of producing the weather picture; visual photography and infrared. => Apart from clouds and fog, satelite imagery can be used to identify other weather phenomenon, such as Low Pressure Systems and Fronts.

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

This sector shows Isolated scattered/broken cumulus and stratocumulus - with moderate icing to the East of the sector, we are in the West of the sector so that does not affect us - and moderate turbulence between 2000-4000 and 5000ft. We can expect moderate turbulence at 3000 ft for this section of flight, but no icing. In the second half of flight, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. In terms of icing and turbulence, sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between 1500-3000ft and 5000-8000ft. We are expected to pass through these clouds at 3000ft which would give moderate turbulence again, with moderate icing also now. Note: the 0⁰C level in sector \"B\" is between 4000 ft and 6000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0⁰C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2⁰C and -20⁰C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures. Current feedback shows the correct answer to be the one indicated, but we would appreciate any further exam feedback on this question.",

All weather data are mapped onto this grid with each grid box representing the atmospheric processes in that region. Atmospheric models can calculate winds, heat transfer, radiation, relative humidity, and surface hydrology within each grid and evaluate interactions within neighbouring points. Numerical prediction equations are applied to each box of the grid and across an aggregation of medium-range weather forecast some two to fifteen days ahead.

            "explanation": "FEW CONSIDERATIONS: Firstly, it is important to point out that this is a Contour chart and pressure information is not provided - Pressure is constant everywhere => this shows the True Altitude of a certain pressure level. For example, the 500 hPa level, in ISA conditions, corresponds to FL180. Isohypses will show you whether its true altitude is found at a lower or higher level (due to temperature variations). Isohypses are are plotted with the reference being MSL and the heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If the contours are high values (wider spaced) then we can assume a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values (closely packed),then we can assume a low pressure. Having that established, it is true that roughly the same rules apply as for isobar charts. The closer the contours the stronger the wind. Circulation of air around a High and Low Pressure system: In the Northern Hemisphere: - The air moves anticlockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Clockwise around a high pressure centre. In the Southern Hemisphere: - The air moves clockwise around a low pressure centre; and - Anticlockwise around a high pressure centre. With regards to this question, We can see that this question depicts a situation in the Northern Hemisphere, in Madrid. Now, notice the wind arrow on the upper side of \"B\", which indicates that the wind is blowing from a Easterly direction, therefore indicating an anticlockwise direction => which means that both are low pressure areas. The tighter packed Isohypses show lower elevations, wider spaced isohypses show higher elevations => by looking at the isohypses, we can see that the contours at \"A\" are closer than at \"B\", therefore true altitude is higher over \"B\" than \"A\". Furthermore, as we have discussed, the contour lines are closer together at \"A\" than at \"B\", so the wind is stronger at \"A\" than at \"B\".",

The height of the tropopause is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. Therefore, temperature variations due to latitude, season, land and sea, will all cause varying heights of the tropopause. At the Equator, the average tropopause height ranges from 16 to 18 km, with temperatures averaging between -75°C and -80°C. Conversely, at the poles, the height is around 8 km, with average temperatures between -40°C and -50°C. Averaging at 50°N, the tropopause height is about 11 km (36 090 ft), accompanied by a temperature of approximately -56.5°C. We would usually recommend that you choose the route with the largest variation in latitude (so an elongated North/South route, but in this case, the correct answer appears to be based on the temperature at FL240 As we have been given the temperatures at FL240 (remember they are all negative numbers), then we can say that the greater the change in temp at FL240, the greater the change in tropopause height (it's a tiny bit of a stretch but still true in most cases), which allows us to answer the question. The greatest change in temperature at FL240 is from Keflavik to Brussels, Route 2, where the temperature changes from around -42ºC to -28ºC. Each other route has a much smaller temperature change.",

We think the current answer is the most correct out of the options given, but it is a little misleading, given that RVR is reported in feet in the USA. ICAO annex 3 defines RVR as follows: Runway visual range (RVR). The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. In METARs, the RVR values are prefixed by the letter “R”, followed by the runway number for which the RVR value applies and the actual RVR value. In annex 3, ICAO specifically dictate that RVR should be measured in metres, but some countries (like the USA) may choose to differ from this as long as they notify ICAO as such. For instance, The United States FAA dictate that there, RVR shall be measured in feet and reported in 100 ft intervals",

We received information about the correct answer, but have not yet had this verified by any other source, so could potentially be different in the real exam, but we believe it should be made a bit more clear by the significant weather chart in the real exam. For the purpose of this question, this Significant Weather Chart (SWC) mainly shows us the location of the jet stream and the height of the tropopause on either side of it. These can tell us enough to work out the expected temperature change in the cruise at FL310. We can see that the jet stream begins far North of Shannon and goes South of Amsterdam, and that would indicate that Amsterdam would be in the \"cold sector\" and Shannon within the \"warm sector\" of that polar front. This is corroborated by the fact that the tropopause heights around Amsterdam are FL300 and around Shannon are much higher at FL410. Working out the temperature difference depends on the heights of the tropopause on either side of the polar front, as well as the height of the jet stream core. Up to the jet stream core altitude, the warm sector is warmer, it usually becomes equal around the height of the jet stream, and then becomes warmer in the stratosphere above the cold sector above this altitude. This, unfortunately, leaves us with 3 possible options; “not enough information”, “temperature remains the same”, and the feedback indicated that “warmer at ToD (Shannon)” was correct, which is a perfectly good option, depending how far away Amsterdam is from the Polar front (see the second figure above). Overall, we will go with the original feedback until informed otherwise.",

This term is commonly applied to higher altitude turbulence associated with windshear. Clear air turbulence (CAT) is often, though not exclusively, associated with jetstreams. Regions of CAT are usually delineated by dashed lines, and will be identified by either a reference number. SIGMET charts give forecasts of the location and level of clear air turbulence. These only indicate regions of moderate and/or severe CAT. Areas of light turbulence are not indicated on SIGWX forecasts. Only Significant Weather Charts (SWC) contain a CAT forecast. A SWC gives areas and levels in which CAT theoretically may occur.",

The satellites travel very close to the Earth (usually between 820 and 970 km above sea level), covering a band 1500 NM wide. Any spot on the globe will experience a southbound pass of the satellite in the morning and a northbound pass in the afternoon or evening. Although picture definition is good, polar orbiting satellites do not give a continuous view of the weather. Geostationary satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, so the satellite appears to remain in the same part of the sky when viewed from the ground. These orbits are much higher than polar orbits (typically 36,000 km) so the satellites travel more slowly, at speeds of around 3 km/s. Picture definition may not be as good as Polar orbitting satellites images, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles.",

This sector shows isolated scattered/broken cumulus and stratocumulus - with moderate icing to the East of the sector, we are in the West of the sector so that does not affect us. We can expect moderate turbulence at 3 000 ft for this section of flight, but no icing. In the second half of flight, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. In terms of icing, sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between cloud bases of 1 500-3 000ft and tops of 5 000 - 8 000ft. The 0ºC level in sector \"B\" is between 4 000 ft and 6 000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0⁰C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2⁰C and -20⁰C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures. The aircraft cannot therefore avoid icing conditions on that route at any of the given levels. Note: There is some debate over whether the aircraft could remain outside of icing conditions at 3 500 ft, as that is lower than the 0ºC isotherm in the B region, however, the CU/SC cloud that would be encountered does include moderate icing and turbulence, and icing can occur just above 0ºC, so we are agreeing with the most recent feedback that 3500 ft would not be able to avoid moderate icing.",

A warm front is shown with a red line and red semi-circles and cold fronts are presented as blue line with blue triangles. The simple rule is that warm air follows a warm front and cold air follows a cold front. We also see increased amounts of cloud and rainfall along the front itself. Often you will see a purple line, with purple semi-circles and triangles next to each other. These are occluded fronts, which form when faster cold fronts \"catch up\" with warm fronts. Sometimes these lines will be broken by crosses or contain a dot. A dot represents a front that is developing, whilst a cross tells us the front is weakening. The air trapped between a warm and cold front is called a \"warm sector\", and we often see low cloud and patchy, light rain associated with this type of air. You may also see thick black lines that have no semi-circles or triangles attached. These are called troughs and mark areas where the air is particularly unstable.

Infrared (IR). Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. Note: Convective cumulus clouds develop puffy cotton shaped profiles. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud If you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

This suggests the likelihood of severe hail and intense precipitation ranging from strong to very strong. Hail typically carries a water film on its surface, causing a hailstone to appear as a substantial water particle. Due to this film and the larger size of hailstones compared to raindrops, thunderstorms featuring significant amounts of wet hail yield stronger radar signals than those with rain. Despite wet hail's excellent radar reflectivity, some hail shafts are notably small (100 yards or less), making them poor radar targets. Hail shafts are commonly identified by four distinct patterns (attached figure): (1) fingers and protrusions, (2) hooks, (3) scalloped edges on the cloud outline, and (4) U-shaped cloud edges spanning 3 to 7 miles.",

            "explanation": "SATELLITE IMAGERY Cloud detection. There are two types of satellites; Polar Orbiting and Geostationary. Polar Orbiting satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited. It takes roughly 2 h to orbit the earth. This satellite orbits between 820 and 870 km above the surface and covers a band 1500 NM wide. Picture definition is good due to its relatively low orbit height – making it possible to identify fog. Geostationary satellites are put into orbit over the Equator and they take 24 hours to complete the orbit. Their orbit is considerably higher than the polar orbiting satellites (36000 km) and picture definition may not be as good, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted towards the poles. There are two methods of producing the weather picture; visual photography and infrared. Visual Images. Although visual photography may be easy to interpret, it suﬀers the disadvantage of not being available continuously, due to lack of sunlight at night. Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black - Visible satellite image show solid clouds (such as CBs) as bright white and wispy clouds (thin or faint cloud - such as cirrus) as translucent whitish layers. Infrared (IR). Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud or fog. If you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

When falling through warmer air before reaching the ground (in this case, due to the temperature inversion, temperature at 3500 ft will be above 0ºC), it melts and turns to rain droplets. It then falls through cold air again before hitting the aircraft surface (at 2000 ft, temperature = -2ºC), the droplets become supercooled.

This is a very difficult question, as the satellite image is not very easy to read, and the region of Scandinavia is huge, and contains many different presentations of clouds on this image. Please send any exam feedback you have to us via the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. To start with, jet streams do not cause cloud. They can sometimes be associated with cirrus clouds due to the warm and cold fronts that jet streams follow, and often the location of a jet stream coincides with the location of cirrus clouds as part of those fronts. It is not a common enough effect to be able to spot jet streams on a satellite image, though. Also, the sub-tropical and arctic jet stream are usually not over the majority of Scandinavia. The arctic jet stream is a little further North when it forms, and the sub-tropical jet stream much further South. So then it is down to warm front vs cold front. Warm fronts are easier to spot because they contain quite dense clouds (particularly towards the lower levels of the front) and are usually quite uniform in shape. The clouds seen in this image are less thick, and quite patchy/isolated in sections, leading us to believe that a cold front is present, particularly running up the Eastern side of Sweden. It could actually be travelling either way, but due to normal air currents we have drawn the cold front line going from West to East. We are not too sure what is being indicated through Finland and across the border into Russia, as the satellite image is not enough alone to work out what has caused this cloud formation. We do not believe it is a warm front, as the clouds do not appear to be thick enough (if the satellite is a visible light image, which we believe it to be)",

Although visual photography may be easy to interpret, it suﬀers the disadvantage of not being available continuously, due to lack of sunlight at night. Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black - Visible satellite image show solid clouds (such as CBs) as bright white and wispy clouds (thin or faint cloud - such as cirrus) as translucent whitish layers. Infrared (IR). Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image => If the clouds near the surface are approx. same temperature as the land surface it can be difficult to distinguish the clouds from land. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud If you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

This question is asking about how pilot reports can actually be used by meteorologists. Not only can pilot reports (PIREPs) be relayed by ATC to inform other aircraft about potential hazards in an area, some of which are not seen by any radar or satellite imaging, but PIREPs can also be inputted into the weather models that generate future forecasts for a region. For instance, the presence of heavy clear air turbulence (CAT) in an area may not be picked up by radar or satellite (as clear air turbulence is invisible), but the pilot report of it can tell a weather model that it is occurring in that region, and it can use this information to inform its forecasted wind speeds, windshear, expected turbulence, etc. The thing to remember is that the data is still very useful, and therefore the computer program used by the meteorologists has a way to merge any pilot report data into the current model. To go through the incorrect options: \"The reports can be directly used in weather prediction systems and processed into PIREPs.\" As mentioned above, these are already PIREPs (Pilot Reports), so the first part is correct, but there is no need to process them to make them into PIREPs. \"The relevant Meteorological Watch Office will process the report and issue a SPECI.\" A SPECI is a special weather report for an aerodrome, they are produced when significant changes have occured since the last METAR was issued. Therefore, most pilot reports will not affect this. \"The meteorological office will rebroadcast these reports because they are incompatible with digital weather processing systems.\" ATC may well rebroadcast the PIREPs (pilot reports) to other pilots who might be affected, but they are compatible with weather processing systems, as explained above. \"The reports can be processed into weather models to improve subsequent forecasts.\" This is correct. As previously explained, this data is very useful for weather models and weather forecasting, so the Meteorological Watch Office can input them into the computer models.",

(Not present on this extract) The report ends with an equal sign. Most of the statements are pretty obviously correct with the decode above (1, 2, and 4). Using the annex, we can see that the coordinates N2706 W07306 are off the East coast of Florida (quite far off the coast, but it never asked about distance), so statement 3 is correct. Statement 5 uses km/h instead of kts, so is incorrect. Again, we have no idea about quite a lot of the content of this question, only the type of question.

It is also very important in this question to use the local true north when determining the wind direction. As the wind barbs highlighted are all of similar direction and the same strength, we do not have to do much interpolation to figure out a wind velocity reading. In the above annex, you can see the location of True North in line with the nearby meridians, as well as the green arrow aligned with the wind barbs, showing the direction.

Please do let us know if you see either in the real exam, and what the correct answer could have been, so we can verify the options and correct answer, as some debate can be had on the chart's interpretation, thank you. Whilst in the first half of the flight, the aircraft is in sector \"D\" of the chart. This sector shows isolated scattered/broken cumulus and stratocumulus - with moderate icing to the East of the sector, we are in the West of the sector so that does not affect us. We can expect moderate turbulence at 3 000 ft for this section of flight, but no icing. In the second half of flight, we pass through sector \"B\" which has an occluded front followed by a slow moving cold/warm front reversal, so many different weather conditions can be expected in this area. In terms of icing, sector \"B\" contains cumulus and stratocumulus clouds which are overcast in the frontal areas between cloud bases of 1 500-3 000ft and tops of 5 000 - 8 000ft. The 0ºC level in sector \"B\" is between 4 000 ft and 6 000 ft, which could make the aircraft in non-icing conditions, however, convective activity such as that associated with fronts in this region can cause air movements that reduce the 0⁰C isotherm, and can cause icing in our case. Also, NASA quotes ice as being worst between +2⁰C and -20⁰C, so we know it can happen in low positive temperatures. The aircraft cannot therefore avoid icing conditions on that route at any of the given levels. Note: There is some debate over whether the aircraft could remain outside of icing conditions at 3 500 ft, as that is lower than the 0ºC isotherm in the B region, however, the CU/SC cloud that would be encountered does include moderate icing and turbulence, and icing can occur just above 0ºC, so we are agreeing with the most recent feedback that 3500 ft would not be able to avoid moderate icing. Further feedback is still required to verify this though.",

This is the least commonly reported, which is good as it is the most questionable, as discussed below. ICAO annex 3 defines RVR as follows: Runway visual range (RVR). The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. In METARs, the RVR values are prefixed by the letter “R”, followed by the runway number for which the RVR value applies and the actual RVR value. In annex 3, ICAO specifically dictate that RVR should be measured in metres, but some countries (like the USA) may choose to differ from this as long as they notify ICAO as such. For instance, The United States FAA dictate that there, RVR shall be measured in feet and reported in 100 ft intervals. ICAO requirements are just that the ICAO member states either follow the SARPs described in the annexes, or that they inform ICAO and publish the differences from the SARPs (within reason, of course). Therefore, we think it possible to say that ICAO requirements allow RVR to be reported in both Metres and Feet (though statute miles would be a push as that unit is too large to be useful in RVR measurements).",

This is almost always higher than the prevailing visibility, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers). In terms of this question, the runway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of centreline markings or lights that can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so the answer \"identify the runway centre line\" must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is \"see the lights delineating the runway\", which you should be able to see also.

Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. With regards to this question, note that this is a night flight.

            "explanation": "WEATHER ATTENUATION The weather radar display depends on signal returns: the more intense the precipitation, the less distance the radar can see through. Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Tip for avoiding shadows: To accurately interpret your radar returns, aim the tilt on your radar down far enough to paint the ground, then look for returns. If you see a potential shadow (a dark, blank area), look for a cell in front of the shadow. If you see a storm before the shadow, avoid it. If you don’t see any storm cells in front of the dark area, it’s probably not a shadow, but may be a large lake or a tall mountain (equally disturbing, depending on your altitude).",

Clouds will appear white, the land grey and the sea black Infrared (IR). Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud",

A knowledge of the radar principle is paramount in order to accurately tune this system and interpret the weather radar display correctly. Reflectivity Weather detection is based on the reflectivity of water droplets. The weather echo appears on the Navigation Display (ND) with a color scale that goes from red (high reflectivity) to green (low reflectivity). The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. For example, a water particle is five times more reflective than an ice particle of the same size.",

It is a very poor \"satellite image\", making it very difficult to pick out any weather patterns, fronts, etc. We hope that the real annex is a little better, but from what we currently know, we don't think it is. We have therefore had to make an educated guess about the correct answer. Further feedback is absolutely essential for making this question more representative of the real exam, thank you. This figure also appears on question 509187. Our best bet for the feature shown by the satellite image is a cold front over Eastern Sweden, which we expect is moving from West to East, as per the usual flow patterns in this area. Therefore, we think that the area to the North of Scandinavia is currently a low pressure region, as per the usual polar front depressions that sweep through this region often. Therefore, we believe that Umea will have lower pressure than Stockholm, as it is closer to the centre of the polar front depression (also called a \"travelling low\"). For Temperature, we simply guessed that the more Northerly Umea will have lower Temperature than Stockholm, due to its higher latitude. Therefore, the answer we have currently gone for is \"Temperature decreases and pressure decreases.\"",

Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. To get a clear picture of the weather you should analyse both the IR and visible images. If both images are bright in the same area => very likely that you can find a very high and thick cloud with high convective activity over that area. If you get cloud returns on a visible imagery but not on an IR image => most likely a low cloud If you get a white return on an IR imagery, along with a translucent whitish layer on a visible imagery => it is most likely a high wispy cloud - a thin layer of cirrostratus.",

On the other hand, CAT area 7 is anticipated to have moderate turbulence from FL270 to FL380. As the aircraft is cruising at FL380, it will be affected by the moderate turbulence in CAT area 7. Considering the information provided, it is worth noting that the region of 50ºN 010ºW falls within CAT area 4. As a result, the first two options which mention an immediate deviation can be excluded as the aircraft will not be flying within CAT area 4 at FL380. Additionally, the region of 45ºN 060ºW is situated within CAT area 7, which means it will experience moderate turbulence, so a deviation should be made just before it.",

In reality, it doesn't matter what we think, or even what it truly correct in some cases, it only matters what EASA think is correct, and the feedback indicates cold occlusion, though this does still need to be verified by further sources, so please comment with anything you can remember from the exam if you see this, thank you!",

Therefore when the radar echo is unable to make the two way trip through heavy precipitation, a \"shadowing\" effect occurs. The stronger the rainstorm, the more radar energy will be scattered by Weather Attenuation. In simple words, Radar attenuation is simply the absorption or reflection of radar signals as the radar pulse penetrates an area of precipitation, preventing that radar from detecting any additional cells that lie behind the first storm. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions. Furthermore, as discussed above, Airborne Weather radar detects large droplet precipitation and hail (present in CBs), it does not detect stratus/stratocumulus or very small water droplets => making it relatively easy to identify embedded cumulonimbus.",

The weather radar echo returns vary in intensity as a function of the droplet size, composition and quantity. => Airborne weather radars do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, often contains water. In some modern radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used to give an indication of likely turbulence. => This function (the TURB function) is based on the Doppler effect and is sensitive to precipitation movement. The TURB function is on most weather radars only active within a range of 40 NM (Doppler measurement capability) and should only be used in wet turbulence.",

Automatic aircraft reporting and pilot reports are fed into the grid forecasting models to provide better weather observation and future forecasting, which could therefore improve the quality of SWC (Significant Weather Charts - These are handmade by the WAFC, who also produce a lot of the digital gridded data), aerodromes TAFs, and general weather prediction.

These fronts mark the boundaries between different air masses. A warm front is shown with a red line and red semi-circles and cold fronts are presented as blue line with blue triangles. The simple rule is that warm air follows a warm front and cold air follows a cold front. We also see increased amounts of cloud and rainfall along the front itself. Often you will see a purple line, with purple semi-circles and triangles next to each other. These are occluded fronts, which form when faster cold fronts \"catch up\" with warm fronts. Sometimes these lines will be broken by crosses or contain a dot. A dot represents a front that is developing, whilst a cross tells us the front is weakening. The air trapped between a warm and cold front is called a \"warm sector\", and we often see low cloud and patchy, light rain associated with this type of air. You may also see thick black lines that have no semi-circles or triangles attached. These are called troughs and mark areas where the air is particularly unstable. This means that the air is quite turbulent with lots of upward motion. We tend to see showers associated with this type of feature and they don't mark any sort of boundary in the same way that a front does.",

Note.— Pre-eruption volcanic activity in this context means unusual and/or increasing volcanic activity which could presage a volcanic eruption. In addition, in the case of transonic and supersonic flight: i) moderate turbulence; or j) hail; or k) cumulonimbus clouds. ICAO defines 4 levels of turbulence intensity, light, moderate, severe and extreme. In very basic terms, 0 - 0.5 G of acceleration is light, 0.5 - 1 G is moderate, 1 - 1.5 G is severe, and anything above that is extreme turbulence. As this scenario fits the criteria for severe turbulence (1.2 G accelerations), a mandatory special air report shall be made by the pilot.

VCSH: Showers (SH) are occurring in the vicinity (VC). SCT012 SCT015 BKN020: The cloud coverage consists of scattered clouds at 1200 feet above ground level (AGL), scattered clouds at 1500 feet AGL, and broken clouds at 2000 feet AGL. 14/13: The temperature is 14 degrees Celsius, and the dew point is 13 degrees Celsius. Q1017: The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1017 hPa. NOSIG: There are no significant weather changes expected. Additionally, the abbreviation \"VC\" stands for vicinity and indicates that a particular weather phenomenon, such as showers, is occurring in the area that lies within a radius of approximately 8 km and 16 km of the aerodrome reference point. In this context, it would imply that showers are present within 8 km of the aerodrome reference point but not directly at the aerodrome itself. (1) showers between 8 km and 16 km of the aerodrome reference point. The term \"ceiling\" refers to the lowest layer of broken or overcast clouds at your intended destination. It represents the height of the cloud base that could potentially impact operations. (2) 2 000 ft. The code \"NOSIG\" in the METAR indicates that there are no significant changes expected in the meteorological conditions within the next two hours. This suggests that the current weather conditions are likely to persist. (3) no significant changes in the next 2 hours.",
