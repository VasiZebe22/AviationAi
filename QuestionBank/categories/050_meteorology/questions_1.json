However, the altitude of the tropopause and the thickness of the troposphere can vary. Over the poles, the tropopause is relatively low, at about 8 km to 10 km, whereas over the equator, it can reach approximately 16 km to 18 km. To illustrate this with a basic example, imagine a partially inflated balloon where the skin of the balloon represents the tropopause, trapping the air inside. When the balloon is heated, the air inside expands, pushing the skin outward. Similarly, when the air in the troposphere heats up, it expands and pushes the tropopause higher. This phenomenon occurs at the equator. Conversely, at the poles, the cooler air causes the air in the balloon to contract, bringing the skin closer to the center. Therefore, the tropopause is much lower over the poles. The height of the tropopause is influenced by the temperature of the air in the troposphere near the surface. Warmer air leads to a higher tropopause, while cooler air results in a lower tropopause. For example, during winter, the tropopause is lower due to colder surface conditions. In summer, with warmer surface conditions, the tropopause rises.",

            "explanation": "In the real atmosphere the tropopause is a continuous surface. INCORRECT. The tropopause is not always one continuous surface. Often there is a distinct tropopause above the tropics with a break at around 30° latitude where a new tropopause forms at a lower level. That tropopause slopes downward toward the pole and sometimes shows another break. A jet stream is often found in these tropopause breaks, which become regions of mixing between troposphere and stratosphere. The height of the tropopause in the ISA is 11 km. CORRECT. The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet (approx. 11 km). You can easily calculate it as follows: To find ISA standard temperature for a given altitude, here's a rule of thumb: double the altitude, subtract 15 and place a - sign in front of it. => (For example, to find ISA Temp at 10,000 feet, we multiply the altitude by 2 to get 20; we then subtract 15 to get 5; finally, we add a - sign to get -5.) ISA Tropopause temperature = -56.5ºC 15ºC – 2ºC x Y = -56.5ºC Y = (-56.5ºC – 15ºC) / 2 Y = approx. 36 Which means 36000 ft. (11 km)",

After insolation has occurred, the surface of the Earth warms up, and produces longer wave radiation (infrared radiation), as well as conduction and convection, which heats the atmosphere from the ground. The greenhouse effect is how the Earth manages to keep its heat in. The greenhouse gasses mostly allow the short wave radiation to penetrate down to the ground, but then keeps a lot of the longer wave radiation in, similar to a greenhouse, which lets shortwave radiation (sunlight) in through the glass walls, but keeps the long wave infrared radiation in to warm up the internal atmosphere for the plants. If the Earth did not have any greenhouse effect, the atmosphere would get very cold, particularly during the night. The greenhouse effect comes from the presence of many different gasses in the atmosphere, and include water vapour, and to a certain extent, clouds as well. The majority of the atmosphere exists beneath the tropopause, within the troposphere, and therefore the vast majority of atmospheric heating happens below the tropopause. The radiation which is trapped is the infrared (long wave radiation), and the ultraviolet from the Sun is allowed to pass through the greenhouse gasses (CO2, NO2, etc.).",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature here increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). This layer is considered turbulence free because the warm air over the cold air mass acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere.",

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 12 290 ft - 5 100 ft = 7 190 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 190/1000) = -575 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­12 865 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. The local pressure equals standard, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL130. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

When the ground gets heated by the Sun during the day, it starts to warm up the air molecules directly touching it. This process is called conduction. Just like when you touch a hot pan on the stove and feel the heat transferring to your hand, the ground transfers its warmth to the air molecules nearby. So, the lower layers of air, those closest to the ground, get warmed up by this direct contact with the warm Earth. As these air molecules heat up, they start moving around faster, spreading the warmth to other nearby air molecules. This sets off a chain reaction, warming up the lower levels of the atmosphere. Convection, radiation, and latent heat also play important roles in heating the atmosphere, but when it comes to how the lower levels get warmed up by the ground, it's primarily through conduction, this direct transfer of heat through molecular interactions between the ground and the air.",

In this case, the aircraft is flying to a place with higher pressure, but keeps the old QNH set on the subscale and continues flying at what they think is 5 500 ft. However, this is not 5 500 ft anymore, as the aircraft has actually gradually changed altitude during the flight due to the change in surface pressure. To calculate whether the aircraft has gained or lost altitude, we can use the rhyme: \"High to Low, Beware Below\" Meaning that if flying from high to low pressure, the actual altitude is reducing (if we don't change the altimeter subscale. We are flying from low to high, so have the opposite issue; we are getting higher. The amount can be easily calculated by multiplying the pressure change by 27 ft/hPa (given in the question, if not give, use 30 ft/hPa) Altitude increase = (1016 - 968) x 27 = 48 x 27 = 1 296 ft This means the new altitude is 5 500 + 1 296 = 6 796 ft However, the question asks us for our height, which is measured above ground level (agl). We therefore just remove the elevation of the ground from 6 796 ft. Height (agl) = 6 796 - 650 = 6 146 ft",

Important aspects in this question: It is a very cold winter’s day. The aircraft is flying at an altitude with regional QNH. In the case of this specific question: Because it is a very cold winter’s day the density is increased. The altimeter will overread and the true altitude will be lower than indicated. If you would go up 27 feet the amount of pressure would decrease faster than in ISA conditions, it would be more than 1 hPa (millibar). So that is why at the altitude of the summit the pressure would be lower than in normal standard atmosphere conditions (ISA). Compared to the elevation of the summit the aneroid altimeter will give a higher indication. And this would be a dangerous condition when you fly in IMC conditions because you have less clearance with the mountain. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below!

Please let us know if you get this in the exam, and send us any feedback you can remember, thank you! The aircraft has been cruising above the transition layer, in reference to a flight level, so has had standard pressure setting (1013.2 hPa) set. This means that the altimeter is indicating the pressure altitude of the aircraft. If the pilot forgets to change the subscale to the QNH of 1006 hPa, the aircraft will not indicate the correct altitude when flying below the transition layer, and will therefore be wrong when at the platform altitude of 5000 ft. Converting from pressure altitude to indicated altitude (altitude with QNH set) will tell us how high the aircraft actually is when the pilot flies at 5000 ft (with 1013 hPa set), as there are no differences in temperature from ISA, therefore indicated altitude = true altitude. Indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. Indicated altitude varies from pressure altitude by the amount of hPa difference multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which is 30 ft/hPa. 1013 - 1006 = 7 hPa 7 x 30 = 210 ft No temperature correction, so the aircraft's true altitude is 5000 - 210 = 4790 ft.",

It varies from true altitude by a difference in temperature from ISA, and varies from pressure altitude (flight levels) due to a difference in pressure setting between QNH and standard pressure setting (1013.25 hPa). If the QNH pressure is set, and the pressure changes but the pilot does not change the altimeter subscale, then the aircraft's true altitude will change without the pilot noticing. This is the same for temperature changes. The rule for both pressure and temperature changes is: High to Low, Beware Below. This means that any decrease in pressure or temperature will cause our true altitude to decrease, and vice-versa. So in this scenario, the static pressure decreasing would cause our true altitude to decrease without the altimeter needle moving. The radio altimeter is not affected by such errors though, and will be a very useful indication of our true altitude, especially whilst flying over the sea. A decreasing radio altimeter indication therefore means that either the radio altimeter is broken, or the pressure is decreasing. On the balance of probabilities, it is much more likely that the pressure is decreasing.",

            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the right, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from low pressure to high pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually increase. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the right, the aircraft's true altitude will be increasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be increasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

The lowest temperature of the day usually occurs then. But why is this temperature after sunrise, you might think? At dawn, when the first light beams across the landscape, the incoming solar radiation is very weak. It does not yet have enough strength to counter all the heat escaping from the surface. As a result, the surface continues to lose heat for some time following sunrise, and the air temperature continues to fall. At some point, the solar rays shine strongly enough to counter the heat loss. The gain-loss balance is shifted, and the air finally begins to warm up.",

Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­270 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 25 000 ft + 270 ft = 25 270 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-35 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-50 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (25 270/1000) = -1 516 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 25 270 ft - 1 516 ft = ­­­­­23 754 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

An atmospheric pressure expressed in terms of altitude which corresponds to that pressure in the Standard Atmosphere.

When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. In the case of this specific question: Because QNH at Palma de Mallorca is the same as in Marseille the pressure is not changed. If, however the true altitude is constantly increasing this would mean that the temperature must be changing. The only way the true altitude is increasing is if the temperature is increasing (warmer than ISA altimeter will under read). Because we now know the altimeter functions correctly no actions should be taken. The increase of true altitude is due to the warmer air mass over Palma de Mallorca.",

QFE: The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. QNE: The indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013,25 is set in the altimeter’s subscale. In other words, it is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold. QFF: Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature. If the airfield is at MSL => QFE, QNH and QFF will all be the same pressure. The temperature could be more or less than +15ºC and the pressure could be more or less than 1013.2hPa; it doesn't have to be ISA conditions. Let's now see why: QFE is the pressure value at the airfield; QNH is a QFE value which has been brought to MSL using ISA conditions; If you were to use actual conditions, QFF would be obtained instead. Imagine that you are in an airfield at MSL, you measure QFE and obtain i.e. 1020 hPa Now, reduce it to MSL with standard conditions to obtain QNH. You are already at MSL, the value is the same. Reduce it to MSL with real conditions to obtain QFF => again, you are already at MSL, the value will not change.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft (14 200 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-23ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft = 9 700 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (9 700/1000) = -970 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­17 170 ft. The minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is 17200 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 10 600 ft (8 600 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -9ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-9) × (10 600/1000) = -382 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­10 982 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 995 hPa = 18 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 486 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 10 982 ft + 486 ft = 11 468 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies an westbound magnetic track VFR flight. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL125. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "Mountains deflect the direction of the air flow, which can cause pressure changes. This, in turn, may influence the pressure altimeter reading. When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop and resulting air density decrease. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude, leaving the airplane at a lower altitude than indicated. This effect mirrors flying from a high-pressure system to a lower-pressure system. Consequently, if the pilot maintains a constant indicated altitude, the true altitude will decrease. The barometric pressure drop when encountering the venturi effect in a mountainous area can be as much as 33 hPa in extreme cases, leading to a dangerous altimeter error of as much as a thousand feet.",

If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. We leave A with a QNH of 986 hPa set on the altimeter. We maintain an indicated altitude of 4 500 feet. Over B the QNH changes to 1011 hPa, but we still maintain with 986 hPa set on the altimeter. The true (actual) altitude of the aircraft at B will change now by: 1011 – 986 = 25 hPa. Close to the ground 1 hPa represents 27 feet. 25 x 27 = 675 feet Because the we are flying to the higher-pressure area without changing our altimeter our true altitude will increase by 675 feet. So, we will actually be flying at 4500 + 675 = 5 175 feet. The question asks for the height of the aircraft above the surface at B (elevation = 690 ft), 5 175ft – 690ft = 4 485 feet. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­-5 ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-24ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -19ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -19ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-19) × (8 000/1000) = -608 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 608 ft.

The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 621 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 608 ft + 621 ft = 9 229 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 9 229 ft, which is FL100. RULES.

These capsules are typically sealed and contain a fixed amount of air at a reference pressure. As an aircraft ascends, the atmospheric pressure outside the capsule decreases. Since the capsule is sealed, the pressure inside remains constant. This pressure differential causes the capsule to expand. Conversely, as the aircraft descends and the outside pressure increases, the capsule contracts. These changes in the capsule’s shape are mechanically linked to the altimeter's needle or digital display, translating the pressure changes into altitude readings. The aneroid capsule is specifically sensitive to low pressure. This is because, at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is significantly lower than at sea level. Therefore, the altimeter must be able to accurately detect and respond to these lower pressures to provide precise altitude information.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 6 430 ft (2 000 ft + 4 430 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­+10ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+9ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -1ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -1ºC. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-1) × (4 010/1000) = -16 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 6 446 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa = 19 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 513 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft = 6 959 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is FL70. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL190 and FL70 individually or to the layer thickness (FL190 - FL70). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 240 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 12 240 ft. RULES.

            "explanation": "There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots: True Altitude - The actual altitude above MSL (mean sea level). Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure. Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True. In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question, they give us a transition altitude (which would be an indicated altitude), and want us to calculate the corresponding pressure altitude (as that is what the pilot changes to whilst climbing through the transition altitude). This difference requires a barometric (pressure) correction, between the QNH of 1028 hPa and the standard pressure setting of 1013 hPa. A good way to remember the next part is to think that indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. The amount of change is calculated using the difference in pressure multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which in this case is given as 27 ft per hPa. If it is not given, it should be assumed to be 30 ft per hPa. 1028 - 1013 = 15 hPa 15 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 405 ft QNH is high, so Indicated Altitude is high, so the Pressure Altitude is 405 ft lower than 6 000 ft. 6 000 - 405 = 5 595 ft, closest answer 5 600 ft",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 254 ft (6 254 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +24ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 254 ft - 3 100 ft = 5 154 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+24) × (5 154/1000) = 495 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 759 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 759 ft + 660 ft = 8 419 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 8 419 ft, which is FL85. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.

During the departure we climbed through the transition altitude (18 000 feet) and we switched from a local QNH setting of 1023 to a standard setting of 1013,25. We return back to the aerodrome but at the transition level (FL190) we forget to switch back to the 1023 pressure setting on the altimeter. So, we will be landing with the altimeter still set to 1013 instead of 1023. Because we have a lower pressure set than actual, we already know that the altimeter will under read. True altitude will be higher than indicated (going from low to higher pressure). We know 1 hPa represents 27 feet near the ground so: 1023 – 1013 = 10 hPa X 27 = 270 feet So, when we land the altimeter will read 270 feet less than the elevation (323 ft) of the aerodrome. 323 – 270 = 53 feet indicated altitude after landing with 1013 still set on the altimeter.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 4 237 ft (2 852 + 385+ 1 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­36ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA +21ºC The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +21ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+21) × (4 237/1 000) = 356 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­3 881 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1038 hPa - 1013 hPa = 25 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 25 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 750 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 3881 ft - 750 ft = 3 131 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 3 131 ft, which is FL35. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

If the temperature at Marseille and Palma would be the same, the aircraft's true altitude would be 156 feet lower at Palma. However, the question states that the aircraft's true altitude does not change. Another way an aircraft’s true altitude can be changed is due to temperature => When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Now we know that the temperature at Palma de Mallorca must be higher than at Marseille as this is the only way that the aircraft's true altitude could be higher again and thus remain the same.

The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds.

Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa) and altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels. Pressure decreases with increasing height.

            "explanation": "During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1030 – 1013 = 17 hPa Using the assumed barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft The aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state: When QNH is higher than standard --> Indicated altitude is higher than pressure altitude. When QNH is lower than standard --> Indicated altitude is lower than pressure altitude. The aircraft's indicated altitude is therefore higher than pressure altitude, so their actual pressure altitude is 510 ft lower than the required 5000 ft, making the pressure altitude 4490ft. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used unless specified otherwise in the question.",

True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. To calculate the aircraft’s true height, let's consider the indicated altitude (with QFE set) of 2000 ft. First, we need to determine the temperature correction. Given an ISA deviation of ISA -38°C and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-38) × (2000/1000) = -304 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude. Therefore, we subtract the temperature correction from the indicated altitude according to the rules, resulting in a true height of 1696 ft (2000 ft – 304 ft).",

During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern. Advection can be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced. Physical quantities characterizing it such as heat are also displaced with the air.",

            "explanation": "When an aircraft departs it is flying on a QNH value. Once it starts climbing it will pass through the transition altitude. Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa. So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting. You would now speak of flight level; the transition levels can be found on SID plates. This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: The question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level. Because the local QNH is 1009 (you came from a standard setting of 1013,25) you go from a higher pressure to a lower one. This means that the altitude shown on the altimeter will decrease.",

Take for example a 900 hPa pressure level, this pressure level normally varies with height over different locations. These heights are plotted as contour lines (also known as isohypses) with the reference being MSL. The heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL (so the true altitude of a pressure level). Isohypses are plotted on upper air charts such as the 850, 700, 500 and 300 mb analysis and forecast charts. If the contours are high values (in comparison to other values on the chart) then we can assume a high pressure exists. The other way if the contours are lower values then we can assume a low pressure. If the contours are closely spaced, we can assume a high-pressure gradient exists. This wind speed is proportional to the distance between the contour lines. Closely spaced is high pressure gradient means higher winds.",

Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the temperature correction can be calculated as follows: Correction for temperature = 4 × (+15) × (11 000/1 000) = 660 ft. You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL120 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL120). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 660 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 660 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause.

The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C.

In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore, pressure correction is disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (34 000/1000) = 2 040 ft.

Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1025 – 1013 = 12 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft The aircraft is 6 000 ft – 5 640 ft = 360 ft lower than remaining traffic. Note 1: The local QNH (1025 hPa) is higher than the standard pressure (1013 hPa). This means that the local QNH datum is lower than the 1013 datum => the aircraft is lower than the remaining traffic. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.",

A ridge is a region with relatively higher pressure. A broad region of sinking air or a deep warm air mass will both lead to ridging. Since air is often sinking within a ridge they tend to bring warmer and drier weather. Fair weather is usually associated with ridges; air under a ridge sinks, which is not conducive for the development of clouds and precipitation.

If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated The same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a high pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be increasing. Thus, true altitude will increase.

In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set (8 500 ft), therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (8 500/1 000) = -340 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 160 ft (8 500 ft – 340 ft). RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1 000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­2 536 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude. As altitude is calculated, when compared to the reference pressure setting (i.e QNH), when flying into lower pressure, the true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = the lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins can differ (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. Above the tropics the height of the tropopause can be as high as 20 km. Aircraft almost never fly at such high levels and thus this information is not important to know.",

            "explanation": "Subsidence inversions occur when high surface pressure is present. This brings divergence at the surface, causing the air column above the high pressure to subside. This air warms up at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) of 3ºC/1000ft, which means that the air quickly gets quite warm, often quite a bit warmer than the air near the ground. This temperature difference will eventually stop the air descending any further, and instead the air begins to spread outward in divergence, but with a layer of cooler air trapped underneath this inversion that has formed. The inversion usually exists at around 2 - 3 000 ft, and can bring a reduction in visibility due to haze and other particles in the air under the inversion. Therefore, the location and time of year for this would be anywhere that gets high pressure systems. Northern continents in Winter, such as Canada and Siberia tend to get very cold, bringing high pressure, so these are correct. Subtropical ocean areas include the belt of subtropical high pressure, so that is certainly correct. Therefore, this option is correct. The Polar regions do have high pressure systems, but less so during the Summer than in the winter. The Equatorial regions tend to have low pressure, due to the intense heating, and the location of the ITCZ (which is a product of this low pressure). Mountainous regions have very varied weather, but you wouldn't expect high pressure for every mountainous region during every season, so incorrect. Note that the Encyclopedia Brittanica quotes the following \"Subsidence inversions are common over the northern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres.\", so we can see where the question writer got this from.",

To remember which way the pressure setting change is applied, remember that increasing the pressure setting in the subscale increases the altitude indicated on the altimeter. An increase of one causes an increase in the other. Now let's work it out. (1) First determine the difference in ft between actual elevation and standby altimeter indication: 243 ft – 164 ft = 79 ft (2) Determine the difference in hPa, assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 70 ft / 27 ft/hPa = 3 hPa (3) Since we want the altimeter to have a higher indication (243 ft instead of 164 ft), the altimeter setting must increase for the actual elevation to be shown: 1018 hPa + 3 hPa = 1021 hPa",

The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude. The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.” The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans, as is detailed in Learning Objective 050.01.01.03.02. The ozone layer is found in the stratosphere. Refer to the annex above for a visual representation of a normal ozone distribution.",

Radiative cooling is commonly experienced on cloudless nights, when heat radiated from the earth surface freely escapes into space, resulting in colder temperatures. This is called a Radiation Inversion and is the most common type of temperature inversion. The air which is just above the earth cools through contact with the cool surface. Air is a poor conductor of heat so only a thin surface layer of air is cooled leaving the air above almost unaffected and therefore warmer. Gentle breezes overnight can cause some mixing of the air near the surface leading to the cool layer becoming slightly thicker as the night progresses. Reduced visibility can be evident below the inversion layer. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. Cloudy skies and strong winds reduce the likelihood of a radiation inversion forming.",

For unsaturated air, the lapse rate is 3°C per 1000 feet; this is called the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR). However, when the parcel of air reaches its dewpoint (100% humidity) and becomes saturated, water vapour condenses, latent heat is released during the condensation process, which warms the air, and the lapse rate reduces to 1.8°C per thousand feet (SALR). At higher altitudes and latitudes, where there is generally less water content in the air, and therefore less latent heat to release, the SALR is closer to 3°C per thousand feet. The ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) is the actual rate at which the ambient temperature changes with height. The overall average (ICAO standard atmosphere) rate is a decrease of about 6.5°C/km (2°C per 1000 feet) up to the tropopause (11 km standard), but the rate varies greatly in different regions of the world, in different airstreams, and at different seasons of the year.

            "explanation": "Thinner air, whether caused by a higher altitude, a higher temperature or a lower pressure decreases aircraft performance in two ways: It decreases the amount of air going into the engine, which means that less fuel can be introduced in order to maintain the correct fuel to air mixture. This produces less power output from the engine and decreases the thrust generated by the fans in the turbofan engines. This increases the amount of time (and therefore runway distance) that it takes to accelerate to take-off speeds. At a particular airspeed, there is less actual air (fewer air particles) moving across the wings. Since this is what produces lift, the airplane must be moving faster in order to create the same amount of lift. This requires more time, and therefore more runway. High elevation = less density/lower pressure = less performance by the engine. Low QNH = less density/lower pressure = less performance by the engine. High temperature = less density = lower performance by the engine.",

During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher.

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation to give the appropriate indicated altitude to fly at, when the correct QNH is set. As the correct QNH will be set, there is no need to make any barometric corrections in this question, only one temperature correction is required. The ISA deviation is ISA -12°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (3500/1000) = 168 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 668 ft. Closest answer 3 670 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1 000 = _____ ft The indicated altitude for the above formula might not be known yet, so true altitude may be used instead. If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

            "explanation": "Conduction is one of the three main ways that heat energy moves from place to place. The other two ways heat moves around are radiation and convection. Conduction is the process by which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighboring atoms or molecules. Conduction occurs more readily in solids and liquids, where the particles are closer together than in gases, where particles are further apart. The rate of energy transfer by conduction is higher when there is a large temperature difference between the substances that are in contact. Since air is a poor conductor, most energy transfer by conduction occurs right near Earth's surface. Conduction directly affects air temperature only a few centimeters into the atmosphere During the day, sunlight heats the ground, which in turn heats the air directly above it via conduction. At night, the ground cools and the heat flows from the warmer air directly above to the cooler ground via conduction. \"Conduction has less of an effect in heating of the troposphere in comparison to convection.\" Correct. Convection plays a more significant role in the distribution of heat than conduction. \"At night the air can be cooled by conduction.\" Correct. At night, the ground loses heat and cools down, and this cooler ground can then cool the air directly above it through conduction. This process is more significant near the surface where the air is in direct contact with the cooler ground. \"The air is a good conductor of heat.\" Incorrect. Air is actually a poor conductor of heat. Gases, in general, have lower thermal conductivity compared to solids and liquids, meaning they do not transfer heat as effectively through conduction. \"Conduction always occurs at a constant rate.\" Incorrect. The rate of conduction depends on various factors, including the temperature gradient (the difference in temperature between two regions), the thermal conductivity of the material, and the cross-sectional area through which heat is being transferred. Thus, the rate of conduction can change based on these variables and is not constant.",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). 50° N is about half the average latitude (between 0 and 90) so we can say that at 50° N the average height of the tropopause is 11 km.",

We will now study Cold and Warm Anticyclones: Cold anticyclones form over continents in winter and over polar areas at any time, accompanied by strong inversions: in the clear air, pronounced frosts and very cold surface conditions result. The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW). Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

To make it more obvious, you can draw the wind general circulation: anticlockwise around a LOW and clockwise around a HIGH, in the NH. You can see that the aircraft will be flying towards a LOW pressure system (from High to Low) => True Altitude will decrease.

            "explanation": "QNH. The atmospheric pressure adjusted to mean sea-level. If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level. QFE. The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. So, it is used to get to know the height above the ground. In the case of this specific question: We need to figure out which of these conditions would give the highest QNH. QNH gives the elevation of the airport from mean seal level. QFE set on the altimeter on the ground would give an indication of 0 feet. QNH will always be a higher value than QFE as long as the airport is above mean sea level. Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa: (1) QFE of 1003 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate the QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1003 hPa = 1047 hPa (2) QFE of 1000 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1000 hPa = 1044 hPa (3) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1039 hPa (4) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1600 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1600 by 27 ft/hPa 59 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1054 hPa => A QFE of 995 with an elevation of 1600 feet will give the highest QNH indication. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. In this particular question, the pressure altitude is not relevant. The given information specifies the height at the QFE setting, and the question is asking for the true height. As per the given question, the aircraft is currently flying at an height of 2 000 ft (while the altimeter subscale is set to airfield QFE). This setting indicates that the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the elevation of the airfield. We need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +12ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the aircraft and the airfield elevation will be taken into account: 2 000 ft (the aerodrome which is located 1000 ft AMSL but the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the airfield). Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (2 000/1 000) = 96 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true height of ­­­­­2 000 ft + 96 ft = 2 096 ft.",

            "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). An altimeter will read an altitude of -69m with the QNH of 1018 hPa set on the altimeter. Because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. QFF is the pressure measured at the airfield adjusted to mean sea level according to the actual temperature conditions. Because of the decreased density/decrease in pressure drop the QNH has been made a lower number compared to QFF to let the airfield still read the correct elevation with QNH set. That way we know that the QFF must be higher than 1018 hPa. So, with warmer temperatures from an airfield below msl it means that QFF is at a higher pressure than QNH. QNH set will give you a negative height and as you climb to zero on your altimeter with QNH set, you will be below msl. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­270 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 16 000 ft - 270 ft = 15 730 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL160). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (16 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-17 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-27 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (15 730/1 000) = -629 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 15 730 ft - 629 ft = ­­­­­15 101 ft. RULES.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter.",

Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 999 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to 1013 hPa (the aircraft’s Indicated altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. 6 000 ft = IA + 30 (999 - 1013) IA = 6 000 ft + 420 ft IA = 6 420 ft The aircraft is 6 420 ft – 6 000 ft = 420 ft higher than remaining traffic.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 7 400 ft (5 400 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 400/1000) = -592 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 992 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 992 ft + 690 ft = 8 682 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies an easterly magnetic track. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANTE NOTE: Here is a compilation of all the feedback we've gathered over the past few months: Portugal: 590 ft Poland: 590 ft Spain: 590 ft Greece: 590 ft LBA: 680 ft HCAA: 590 ft Austria: 590 ft We are not exactly sure why this would be the case between different authorities, but maybe there was a small change of number in the question (it can be sometimes minutely changed between questions). There is also the possibility that the states calculate their true altitude differently. There are a couple of places where the method could be modified ever so slightly, such as deciding which altitude to use as the ISA reference in the temperature correction. This could lead to a lower obstacle clearance answer, but very close to our own. We do still believe our method to be more correct though, given the way the ISA works. The incredibly small difference this makes means it is not usually a factor, and therefore never really talked about. This question gives us a planned Flight Level of 290 (pressure altitude 29,000ft) and some meteorological conditions, which we must use to calculate our true altitude, and then compare to the local highest terrain to find our terrain clearance at this altitude. To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn pressure altitude into indicated altitude. The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 = 31 hPa less than standard pressure. Because we are in low pressure, our indicated altitude is lower than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 = 930 ft lower than the pressure altitude. Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 = 28,070 ft To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate. ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C. As our temperature is lower than ISA, our true altitude will be even lower than our indicated altitude. Temperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet). In this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)1909 ft Therefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 = 26,161 ft This makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 = 701 ft, closest answer 590 ft Note: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 540 ft and 680 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

Please report in the comments if you see this (or a similar style question in an exam, thank you.) To start, we need to know the flight level (pressure altitude), and then the expected ISA temperature calculated to check the temperature in the option. Calculator Trick This is more of a rule of thumb, you go down and across the calculator as shown in the annex above, and the numbers of the buttons are the hundreds of hectopascals, then you count up from 1 to 5, and those are the hundreds of flight levels. For instance, 700 hPa is approximately FL100, 500 hPa is FL 180 (which is close to FL200, a discrepancy of this method), 300 hPa is approximately FL300, etc. Note: 200 hPa actually equates to FL390, and 100 hPa equates to FL510, to be a little more precise. The others are very close, remembering the 500hPa = FL180. We can then use this method to calculate the flight level, and use the formula: ISA temp. = 15 - 2 (pressure altitude in thousands of feet) Also, remember that the ISA temperature reduces by 2ºC down to -56.6ºC, where it then becomes isothermal, so all altitudes above approx. 36 000 ft have an ISA temp of -56.5ºC, up to about 60 000 ft. Using these methods, At 700 hPa, the ISA temperature is -5ºC. At 500 hPa, the ISA temperature is -21ºC. At 200 hPa, the ISA temperature is -56.5ºC. (the ISA temperature does not drop below this value) At 300 hPa, the ISA temperature is -45ºC.",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. Conduction = The transfer of heat energy by direct contact. Convection = The transfer of heat by the motion of a matter, the mixing of liquids or gasses. Radiation = The transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation (waves). In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the stratosphere begins can differ. The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The lower boundary of the stratosphere is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The base of the stratosphere is therefore lower near the poles because of the low ground temperatures.",

After take-off, the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes (QNH set) until the Transition Altitude (TA). Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa) and altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels. Pressure decreases with increasing height. Which means that when the pilot changes the altimeter setting from local QNH (1041 hPa), to a lower pressure (1013 hPa), the altimeter reading will decrease. (Increasing the subscale setting increases the altitude readout, decreasing the subscale setting decreases the altitude readout.)

The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. 1. When we move from the equator to the north pole, the temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the altitude of the tropopause decrease. 2. Due to the overall decrease in temperature with altitude, the temperature at the tropopause is lower/colder equatorward and higher/warmer poleward.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 14 500 ft (12 500 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (14 500/1000) = -1 450 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­15 950 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 980 hPa = 33 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 33 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 990 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 950 ft + 990 ft = 16 940 ft. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL170. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            ],
            "explanation": "“The Earth is heated by long-wave radiation from the Sun, but cooled by its own short-wave radiation into space.” Incorrect. Heat is transferred via radiation from the Sun to the Earth’s surface. Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth. “The Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.” Incorrect The Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy. “Cloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.” Incorrect. Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth. Correct. “More heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.” The temperature of an object dictates how quickly they will lose energy to their surroundings. Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects, and thus a hotter planet will shed more energy to space than a colder planet.",

We know that close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft. Therefore: 450 ft / 27 ft = 17 hPa approx. Now, When changing an altimeter setting to a lower value - Altimeter reading decreases. (ie. 1013 hPa to 999 hPa) When changing and altimeter setting to a higher value – Altimeter reading increases (ie. 1013 hPa to 1030 hPa) In this case, we want to increase the altimeter reading by 450 ft (from 4500 ft to 4950 ft). Therefore, we need to add 17 hPa to 1013 hPa for our altimeter to read true altitude of 4950 ft. QNH = 1013 + 17 = 1030 hPa. SECOND METHOD: to simplify your calculations we suggest using the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) + (4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev) Where TA = True Altitude and IA = Indicated Altitude. “(4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev)” can be disregarded in this case because temperature = ISA. TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 (QNH – 1013) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 QNH – 27351 QNH = 1030 hPa approx. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Since we fly on Flight level 120 (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But normally our actual flight level will change if we have non-standard conditions. Our local QNH is 1013. This is the same as according the ICAO standard atmosphere. So, until so far it is logical why the true altitude also indicates 12 000 feet. However, we have to realise that the temperature variation from ISA also affects our true altitude. In this case because true altitude = indicated altitude (and we already know the QNH value is according to ISA)we know that their cannot be any temperature deviation from ISA. True altitude (TA) would have been higher than indicated altitude (IA) if the temperature was warmer than ISA, and TA would have been lower than IA if the temperature was colder than ISA. And thus, the average temperature is the same as ISA.",

QNH is QFE reduced to mean sea level using the assumed conditions of standard atmosphere and the elevation of the airport. If the pilot sets the current QFE into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate zero when on the ground. When the pilot sets the current QNH into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate the elevation of the airport when on the ground. Therefore, in this case, with QNH set in the altimeter window, the altimeter will indicate 1 411 ft. We need to find out the QFE = the altimeter setting that will cause 0 ft indication. When we set a lower value into the altimeter window the altimeter indication decreases and vice versa (higher setting means a higher indication). In this case we need to reduce the altimeter indication by 1 411 ft => we need to reduce the altimeter setting value. Close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft, therefore 1 411 ft reading reduction means a reference value change of approx. 52 hPa (1 411 ft ÷ 27 ft) => QNH 994 hPa - 52 hPa = QFE 942 hPa.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.01.06.03.06: Determine the true altitude/height for a given altitude/height and a given ISA temperature deviation. There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots: True Altitude - The actual altitude above msl (mean sea level). Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure. Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True. In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a Pressure Altitude of 3 300 ft, and also an Indicated Height of 3300 ft. Not only does that tell us that the QNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), but it also tells us that our QFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level. This has the very nice effect of making height and altitude interchangeable. This simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA. ==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude. ==> When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. As this scenario has an OAT of 15ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places). Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA) So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 = 198 ft True Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so True Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 = 3 102 ft * Indicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3.",

In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 983 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1021 hPa - 983 hPa = 38 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 38 hPa x 27 ft = 1026 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 7500 ft - 1026 ft = 6474 ft The elevation at B is 1650 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 6474 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 6474 ft - 1650 ft = 4824 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 983 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 1650 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1021 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 1650 ft + 1026 ft = 2676 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 7500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1021). We need to climb 7500 ft - 2676 ft = 4824 ft (which is our height over the surface).

We have had to assume that the OAT is measured at the aircraft and that the QNH was measured at sea level. These are not always the case, and were ambiguous in our feedback. The aircraft's indicated altitude is 4 500 ft. We know that the true altitude of the highest obstacle is 3 120 ft. We must therefore calculate the aircraft's true altitude from the indicated altitude, which is a simple matter of a temperature correction. In an ISA atmosphere, the temperature at the aircraft's altitude (4 500 ft) would be 15 - 2(4.5) = 6ºC. The actual outside air temperature is -4ºC, so the OAT is ISA -10ºC. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA. ==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude. ==> When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. As this scenario has an OAT of 10ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA) So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 4.5 x 10 = 180 ft. 4500 - 180 = 4 320 ft, the aircraft's true altitude. 4 320 - 3 120 = 1 200 ft obstacle clearance",

As you can see in the attached figure, in the troposphere, the temperature first decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. That is why the temperature laps rate changes abruptly at the tropopause. Recent feedback added the option “temperature and pressure lapse rate change abruptly at the tropopause”, and we think the feedback indicated it as incorrect, as well as the fact that the temperature lapse rate is the major change (and the only one on the syllabus), and the pressure lapse rate is more complex and unlikely to change suddenly due to the beginning of this isothermal layer.",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature in the stratosphere increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. The warm air over the cold air mass (as in this question is the case) acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). Thus, the layer above the tropopause is absolutely stable.",

This reflection prevents a considerable amount of solar energy from reaching the Earth's surface, resulting in cooler maximum surface temperatures compared to when the sky is clear. At night, the situation changes. Clouds have the ability to absorb and trap thermal radiation, particularly infrared radiation, which is emitted by the Earth's surface. As the surface loses heat energy through radiation, the clouds absorb this infrared radiation. The absorbed energy is then re-radiated back towards the surface, effectively acting as a blanket or insulator. This re-radiation of the absorbed infrared radiation by clouds helps to maintain warmer surface temperatures during the night compared to clear sky conditions.",

This means that changing the subscale on an altimeter influences the readout on that altimeter in the same direction. Increasing the subscale setting increases the altitude readout, decreasing the subscale setting decreases the altitude readout. Now that we know the direction things go in, the question is very easy. if we are using 30 ft/hPa (which you should always use unless told in the question to use something else), then that difference of 1010 - 992 = 18 hPa reduces the altitude readout by 18 x 30 = 540 ft. 1500 - 540 = 960 ft",

The coolest time of the day is just after sunrise, and the ground and air heat up graddually until early afternoon, when the temperature begins to drop again. This means that between 08:30 and 11:00 local time, the temperature will have risen quite a bit. A rise in air temperature causes a reduction in air density, due to the increased collisions between particles, keeping them further apart. Reduced air density leads to a reduction in the amount of air particles flowing over an aircraft's wings, which leads to a reduction in ift. This means that an aircraft must fly faster to gain the same amount of airflow, to get the same amount of lift. this lengthens take-off distances as the aircraft has to reach a higher speed. The engines are even more affected by temperature rises and density reduction. both piston and gas turbine engines produce higher power when the air is colder (and therefore denser), as there is more oxygen to burn alongside the fuel. Gas turbine engines also become TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature) limited when temperatures get above a certain amount, and this leads to the engine having to reduce their thrust output to stop the turbine melting. Propellers are also affected in the same way as wings, by having reduced air, they produce less power. Therefore, no matter what type of aircraft is being referenced, the power/thrust output will be reduced by the higher heat in the middle of the day, and therefore the take-off climb performance will be degraded.",

The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be higher than 1016 because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will under read, the altimeter would indicate a lower airfield elevation than 400m. If we set a higher QNH, than the temperature correction is compensated. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 977 hPa = 36 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 36 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 1 080 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 080 ft = 3 920 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude 1 600 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA approx. -22ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 920 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 320 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (2 320/1000) = -204 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 920 ft - 204 ft = ­­­­­3 716 ft. Meaning that our clearance from the obstacle is 3 716 - 2 320 = 1 396 ft ⇒ closest answer 1 420 ft RULES.

The surface radiates heat away as infrared radiation, and therefore the surface cools down. The air in contact with the surface is now warmer than the surface, and so heat will begin to flow from the air to the surface by conduction. This takes heat energy away from the low level air, causing the temperature to drop below the dewpoint, forming fog. Air flowing over a cold surface does a similar thing. The warmer air flows over a colder surface, and heat flows by conduction from the air into the surface. This cools the lower layers of air, and causes the overall ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) to decrease (as the lower air is already cold), often creating an inversion at the altitude where that cold air gradually returns to normal temperature. The lower ELR and potential for an inversion make the air more stable, as any air which is forced to rise (at the DALR or SALR) will then be colder than the surrounding air, so will sink again. This often gives rise to advection fog, where that low level air cools below the dewpoint.",

Since we fly on Flight level 135 (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But normally our actual flight level will change if we have non-standard conditions. Our local QNH now is 1019. Normally (because of the higher pressure) our true altitude would be higher than our indicated altitude. But our true altitude is still 13500 feet. Thus, this will mean that the temperature has to be different than ISA, because if the temperature would have been ISA, our true altitude would have been higher than 13500 feet. The only way our true altitude can be lowered again to maintain 13500 feet (FL 135) is if the conditions where the aircraft is flying in have a lower temperature than ISA.

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at an altitude of 4 000 ft, unless local QNH is set. Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1013 hPa is set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 4 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to the local QNH (the aircraft’s True Altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. TA = 4 000 ft + 27 (1030 hPa – 1013 hPa) TA = 4 459 ft The aircraft is 4 459 ft – 4 000 ft = 459 ft higher than remaining traffic. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used, which would give you a result of 510 ft.",

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL110 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL110). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a colder air mass, the deviation is a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 720 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 280 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

            "explanation": "This question is based upon you knowing the relationship between QFF and QNH. QFE is the pressure at the station (or aerodrome) level. QNH is the mean sea level pressure, derived by applying ICAO's standard atmosphere corrections to QFE. QFF is the mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. Considering the above definitions, we can say that, in ICAO's standard atmosphere, when landing at sea level with QNH set on your altimeter - it will read \"0 ft\". Now, this question states that actual temperature at 4 000 ft is -20ºC - Which means that the air is 27ºC colder than ISA (ISA temperature at 4000 ft = 15 - 2 x 4 = 7ºC). => Normally, a standard lapse rate of 1 hPa per 27 ft is used to calculate the difference between QNH and QFE. However, in cold and dense air, pressure changes more rapidly and the pressure change will be more than that. Thus in colder than standard temperature QFF is more than QNH. Since the QFF (actual pressure at MSL) will be higher than the QNH, when the aircraft reaches MSL, the ambient pressure will be higher than the value set on the altimeter (QNH), therefore, it will indicate a value less than zero. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Insolation and clouds The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. The clouds then have an effect on the outgoing infrared radiation, by absorbing this radiation, and re-radiating it back down, creating a blanket around that section of the Earth. This is where a disagreement may occur, as that could be considered to be the clouds \"reflecting\" the infrared radiation back down, but in reality, they primarily absorb the infrared, and re-radiate it in all directions. SUMMARY The clouds reflect UV rays back into space The clouds absorb and re-radiate the infrared radiation from the Earth's surface.",

            "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Because the airport is situated 400 meters above sea level with a QFF of 1016 and the question states the air temperature is 10 degrees lower than ISA, we can calculate the QNH. 400m x 3,285 = 1314 feet X 1,04 (4 % temperature correction for every 10 degrees below ISA) = 1366,6 feet / 27 (drop of 1 hPa according to ISA near the ground) = 50,6 hPa 1314 feet / 27 = 48,7 hPa 50,6 -48,7 = roughly 2 hPa. So, the QNH will be 1014 and the QFF = 1016. We do not need to do these time-consuming calculations because most of the questions just ask if the QNH would be more or less than QFF. Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is colder than ISA, the air is more dense and thus pressure will drop faster with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be lowered (lower than 1016) because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will overread. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here.

Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: As you can see in the image, the temperature first decreases with altitude in the troposphere, in the stratosphere the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. So that is why the division between the troposphere and the stratosphere can be made according the temperature profile.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 10 000 ft - 690 ft = 9 310 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­0 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +5ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 9 310 ft - 1 500 ft = 7 810 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (5) × (7 810/1000) = 156 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 9 466 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 9 466 ft - 5 000 ft = 4 466 ft (4 500 ft is the closest option). RULES.

Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa. So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting. You would now speak of flight level; the transition levels can be found on SID plates. This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: We go from a standard pressure setting of 1013,2 to the local QNH setting. The indication now changes from a flight level to an altitude.",

QFF = Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature. In case of this specific question: QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). The question states that an airfield is located at mean sea level. Because of this there is no need for any temperature corrections because the airfield does not have any elevation. Thus, will the QNH be the same as the QFF and the same as the QFE.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.01.01.02.04: Describe the variations of the FL and temperature of the tropopause from the poles to the equator. The atmosphere is split up into many different layers. The lowest layer is the troposphere, followed by the stratosphere. In general, these are the two that pilots care about most. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, and is where the stratosphere begins. The atmosphere is not always the same height though, in fact it varies wildly in height between the tropics and the poles. Over the equator, the atmosphere is very tall, due to both heat (meaning that pressure reduces at a lower rate with altitude) and other effects such as convection and general circulation of air. The atmosphere over the poles has much less height, this is mostly to do with the reduced convection and the cold air, which loses pressure more quickly with altitude. The height of the troposphere (which is indicative of the atmosphere in general) will therefore change from season to season, as solar heating differs due to the angle of the sun to the ground. In the winter season, in general a hemisphere will have a lower tropopause, and in the summer, a higher tropopause. This also coincides with how close a particular place is to the ITCZ, the heat equator, which moves with the seasons. In the tropics, the tropopause reaches around FL550 in summer, dropping a little in the winter, depending on where in the tropics. At the poles, it can drop to as low as FL200 around the winter time, and up to around FL250 in the summer. The ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) has the tropopause at 36 090 ft, which is a good average for areas at 40-50º Latitude (above this in summer, below it in winter). Therefore FL250 to FL350 sounds plausible for 55º N, which equates to the South of Scotland, or around the latitude of Denmark. Note: You only need a rough idea of tropopause heights for this question (especially as two answers can be removed for having higher winter heights than summer heights, which is not correct) and the learning objective above is vague, but does not require memorizing a table or any such deep knowledge.",

Terrestrial Radiation The Earth radiates energy into the atmosphere in the form of terrestrial radiation. It is more readily absorbed by the atmosphere especially by clouds, water vapour and carbon dioxide that solar radiation due to its longer wavelength. The absorption of heat by the atmosphere from the Earth is the main heat exchange mechanism that causes weather. Any terrestrial radiation not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere escapes back into space. SUMMARY Insolation: sun warms the Earth; Radiation: Earth loses heat, radiates heat. During the day, insolation predominates over radiation; hence Earth gets warmer. At night, radiation predominates; Earth cools down.

Learning Objective 050.01.02.06.01: Explain the cooling/warming of the surface of the Earth by radiation. Insolation The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. Therefore, for this question, the short-wave radiation from The Sun heats the Earth, and the Earth loses it's heat through long-wave radiation (amongst other forms of heat loss).",

As a result, temperatures decrease more slowly than if the skies were clear. During the day, the earth is heated by the sun. If skies are clear, more heat reaches the earth's surface. This leads to warmer temperatures. However, if skies are cloudy, some of the sun's rays are reflected off the cloud droplets back into space.

In the case of this specific question: The question asks about the QFE and QNH at an airport situated 50 feet below sea level. Because of this the QFE will be measured 50 feet below sea level, the QNH will still be measured at sea level which is 50 feet higher. We know that a higher altitude has a lower pressure, so the barometric value of QNH is lower than QFE.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 240 ft (6 240 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 8 240 ft - 1 240 ft = 7 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (7 000/1000) = -336 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 576 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 390 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 576 ft + 390 ft = 8 966 ft. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). The average height of the tropopause over the equator is around 16 km (max 20km) and the temperature is around -80 °C.",

The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause.

The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C. Calculating the average tropopause height (ft): Tropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280 for winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result. Latitude is given by the question: 60ºN Tropopause height = (16 x cos 60º) x 3280 = 26 240 ft Overhead the sea, it is usually warmer. Therefore, we would have to choose the next higher value. From available options, 20 000 ft would be too low. Best option: 29 000 ft. Note: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value.

First, we need to determine the temperature correction. Given an ISA deviation of ISA -15ºC and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 500/1000) = -270 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude.

The flight is performed maintaining a constant Indicated Altitude of 6 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1012 hPa (and that is all we need from Point A - elevation is irrelevant). In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 977 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1012 hPa - 977 hPa = 35 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 35 hPa x 27 ft = 945 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 6500 ft - 945 ft = 5555 ft The elevation at B is 930 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 5555 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 5555 ft - 930 ft = 4625 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 977 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 930 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1012 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 930 ft + 945 ft = 1875 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 6500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1012). We need to climb 6500 ft - 1875 ft = 4625 ft (which is our height over the surface).

Conduction involves the transfer of heat through molecular contact and influences the temperature of the air directly in contact with the Earth's surface. However, its impact diminishes with altitude due to air's poor conductivity. Convection occurs as the surface heats the air above, causing it to rise due to decreased density. This vertical movement is a key mechanism for transferring heat upwards, leading to cloud formation and further warming through latent heat release. Turbulent mixing aids in horizontal air mass movement and heat distribution within the atmosphere, but its role in vertical heat transfer is less significant compared to convection. Radiation is crucial, with the Earth's surface absorbing solar radiation and emitting it as longwave radiation, warming the air above. In summary, convection and radiation are the dominant processes that transfer heat from the Earth's surface to the higher levels of the troposphere. While conduction's impact is limited vertically, and turbulent mixing primarily affects horizontal heat transfer. Therefore, conduction and turbulence predominantly contribute to heat transfer to the lower levels of the atmosphere.",

To remember which way the pressure setting change is applied, remember that increasing the pressure setting in the subscale increases the altitude indicated on the altimeter. An increase of one causes an increase in the other. Now let's work it out. (1) First determine the difference in ft between actual elevation and standby altimeter indication: 254 ft – 173 ft = 81 ft (2) Determine the difference in hPa, assuming a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa (use 30 ft/hPa if it has not been specified in the question): 81 ft / 27 ft/hPa = 3 hPa (3) Since we want the altimeter to have a higher indication (254 ft instead of 173 ft), the altimeter setting must increase for the actual elevation to be shown: 1018 hPa + 3 hPa = 1021 hPa",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, the aircraft is flying an altitude with the correct QNH set, therefore, pressure correction shall be disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (4 000/1000) = -240 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­3 760 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "• True altitude is the vertical distance of the aircraft above sea level, specifically above mean sea level. • Indicated altitude is the barometric altitude displayed by the altimeter, which shows the aircraft's height above mean sea level. Adjusting the altimeter's sub-scale setting changes the altitude reading. Decreasing the sub-scale value (setting a lower pressure) will cause the altimeter to show a lower altitude. This happens because a lower pressure setting moves the reference level closer to your vertical position, and vice versa. For example, changing the sub-scale setting from 1030 hPa to 1010 hPa will lower the altimeter reading, as the distance between the aircraft and the 1010 hPa pressure level is less than the distance to the 1030 hPa level. When flying from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the actual altitude decreases while the indicated altitude remains the same. This discrepancy causes the altimeter to over-read the aircraft's true altitude. Flying from high pressure to low pressure: actual altitude < indicated altitude (QNH) Flying from low pressure to high pressure: actual altitude > indicated altitude (QNH) With the altimeter set to a QNH of 1030 hPa, if the indicated altitude is 8500 ft, but the local QNH is actually 1010 hPa (20 hPa lower), maintaining a QNH of 1030 hPa would mean the true altitude (based on a QNH of 1010 hPA) of the aircraft is lower than the indicated altitude by: 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft Therefore, ⇒ True altitude = 8 500 ft - 600 ft = 7 900 ft",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. When we move from south to north in the Northern Hemisphere we move from the equator to the poles. The temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the height of the tropopause decrease.",

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

To solve this question, all we need to do is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­594 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 3 600 ft - 594 = 3 006 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­15 900 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 900 ft + 300 ft = 16 200 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL50 and FL140 individually or to the layer thickness (FL140 – FL50). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.

            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the left, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from high pressure to low pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually decrease. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the left, the aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be decreasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation, to get the indicated altitude (with local QNH set). To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15°C, and the temperature lapse rate is -2°C/1000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15°C - (6500/1000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2°C. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-9°C, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -11°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-11) × (6500/1000) = -286 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­6786 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.

To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 979 hPa = 34 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 34 ft x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­1 020 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 020 ft = 3 980 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -21.8ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -21.8ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 980 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 380 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-21.8) × (2 380/1000) = -207 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 773 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 3 773 ft - 2 320 ft = 1 453 ft (1470 ft is the closest option). RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude of 36 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-2ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -17ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 5 860 ft - 36 ft = 5 824 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (5 824/1000) = -396 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­6 256 ft.

This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 256 ft + 1 230 ft = 7 486 ft.

Cold temperature corrections exist because barometric altimeters are calibrated for ISA conditions, and when the air column is colder than ISA, the pressure drops faster with altitude, and the altimeter will over-read.

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore, pressure correction is disregarded. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL390). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at FL390 is -56.5ºC (since it is below ISA tropopause). The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-48 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +8.5ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +8.5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (8.5) × (34 000/1000) = 1 156 ft. The temperature correction is added the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­­40 156 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 40 156 ft - 29 029 ft = 11 127 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Therefore, the gap between 14 600 ft and 13 000 ft = 1 600 ft. Alternatively, you can use the following method: TA = 13 000 ft TL = 15 000 ft Which results in a 2 000 ft difference.

            "explanation": "On average, the troposphere extends up to 11 km above mean sea level (AMSL) in the mid-latitudes. However, the altitude of the tropopause and the thickness of the troposphere can vary. Over the poles, the tropopause is relatively low, at about 8 km to 10 km, whereas over the equator, it can reach approximately 16 km to 18 km. To illustrate this with a basic example, imagine a partially inflated balloon where the skin of the balloon represents the tropopause, trapping the air inside. When the balloon is heated, the air inside expands, pushing the skin outward. Similarly, when the air in the troposphere heats up, it expands and pushes the tropopause higher. This phenomenon occurs at the equator. Conversely, at the poles, the cooler air causes the air in the balloon to contract, bringing the skin closer to the center. Therefore, the tropopause is much lower over the poles. The height of the tropopause is influenced by the temperature of the air in the troposphere near the surface. Warmer air leads to a higher tropopause, while cooler air results in a lower tropopause. For example, during winter, the tropopause is lower due to colder surface conditions. In summer, with warmer surface conditions, the tropopause rises.",

            "explanation": "In the real atmosphere the tropopause is a continuous surface. INCORRECT. The tropopause is not always one continuous surface. Often there is a distinct tropopause above the tropics with a break at around 30° latitude where a new tropopause forms at a lower level. That tropopause slopes downward toward the pole and sometimes shows another break. A jet stream is often found in these tropopause breaks, which become regions of mixing between troposphere and stratosphere. The height of the tropopause in the ISA is 11 km. CORRECT. The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet (approx. 11 km). You can easily calculate it as follows: To find ISA standard temperature for a given altitude, here's a rule of thumb: double the altitude, subtract 15 and place a - sign in front of it. => (For example, to find ISA Temp at 10,000 feet, we multiply the altitude by 2 to get 20; we then subtract 15 to get 5; finally, we add a - sign to get -5.) ISA Tropopause temperature = -56.5ºC 15ºC – 2ºC x Y = -56.5ºC Y = (-56.5ºC – 15ºC) / 2 Y = approx. 36 Which means 36000 ft. (11 km)",

After insolation has occurred, the surface of the Earth warms up, and produces longer wave radiation (infrared radiation), as well as conduction and convection, which heats the atmosphere from the ground. The greenhouse effect is how the Earth manages to keep its heat in. The greenhouse gasses mostly allow the short wave radiation to penetrate down to the ground, but then keeps a lot of the longer wave radiation in, similar to a greenhouse, which lets shortwave radiation (sunlight) in through the glass walls, but keeps the long wave infrared radiation in to warm up the internal atmosphere for the plants. If the Earth did not have any greenhouse effect, the atmosphere would get very cold, particularly during the night. The greenhouse effect comes from the presence of many different gasses in the atmosphere, and include water vapour, and to a certain extent, clouds as well. The majority of the atmosphere exists beneath the tropopause, within the troposphere, and therefore the vast majority of atmospheric heating happens below the tropopause. The radiation which is trapped is the infrared (long wave radiation), and the ultraviolet from the Sun is allowed to pass through the greenhouse gasses (CO2, NO2, etc.).",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature here increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). This layer is considered turbulence free because the warm air over the cold air mass acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere.",

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 12 290 ft - 5 100 ft = 7 190 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 190/1000) = -575 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­12 865 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. The local pressure equals standard, therefore pressure correction may be disregarded. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL130. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). The average height of the tropopause over the equator is around 16 km (max 20km).",

Now, think about how the ground, like the surface of the Earth, is like a warm stove. When the ground gets heated by the Sun during the day, it starts to warm up the air molecules directly touching it. This process is called conduction. Just like when you touch a hot pan on the stove and feel the heat transferring to your hand, the ground transfers its warmth to the air molecules nearby. So, the lower layers of air, those closest to the ground, get warmed up by this direct contact with the warm Earth. As these air molecules heat up, they start moving around faster, spreading the warmth to other nearby air molecules. This sets off a chain reaction, warming up the lower levels of the atmosphere. Convection, radiation, and latent heat also play important roles in heating the atmosphere, but when it comes to how the lower levels get warmed up by the ground, it's primarily through conduction, this direct transfer of heat through molecular interactions between the ground and the air.",

The difference between 1013 hPa and 993 hPa is 20 hPa (1013 - 993), so the altimeter is set at a value 20 hPa too high. This corresponds to a difference of 540 feet (20 hPa x 27 ft/hPa).

In this case, the aircraft is flying to a place with higher pressure, but keeps the old QNH set on the subscale and continues flying at what they think is 5 500 ft. However, this is not 5 500 ft anymore, as the aircraft has actually gradually changed altitude during the flight due to the change in surface pressure. To calculate whether the aircraft has gained or lost altitude, we can use the rhyme: \"High to Low, Beware Below\" Meaning that if flying from high to low pressure, the actual altitude is reducing (if we don't change the altimeter subscale. We are flying from low to high, so have the opposite issue; we are getting higher. The amount can be easily calculated by multiplying the pressure change by 27 ft/hPa (given in the question, if not give, use 30 ft/hPa) Altitude increase = (1016 - 968) x 27 = 48 x 27 = 1 296 ft This means the new altitude is 5 500 + 1 296 = 6 796 ft However, the question asks us for our height, which is measured above ground level (agl). We therefore just remove the elevation of the ground from 6 796 ft. Height (agl) = 6 796 - 650 = 6 146 ft",

When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Important aspects in this question: It is a very cold winter’s day. The aircraft is flying at an altitude with regional QNH. In the case of this specific question: Because it is a very cold winter’s day the density is increased. The altimeter will overread and the true altitude will be lower than indicated. If you would go up 27 feet the amount of pressure would decrease faster than in ISA conditions, it would be more than 1 hPa (millibar). So that is why at the altitude of the summit the pressure would be lower than in normal standard atmosphere conditions (ISA). Compared to the elevation of the summit the aneroid altimeter will give a higher indication. And this would be a dangerous condition when you fly in IMC conditions because you have less clearance with the mountain. Remember the mnemonic: Flying from high to low, look out below!

Please let us know if you get this in the exam, and send us any feedback you can remember, thank you! The aircraft has been cruising above the transition layer, in reference to a flight level, so has had standard pressure setting (1013.2 hPa) set. This means that the altimeter is indicating the pressure altitude of the aircraft. If the pilot forgets to change the subscale to the QNH of 1006 hPa, the aircraft will not indicate the correct altitude when flying below the transition layer, and will therefore be wrong when at the platform altitude of 5000 ft. Converting from pressure altitude to indicated altitude (altitude with QNH set) will tell us how high the aircraft actually is when the pilot flies at 5000 ft (with 1013 hPa set), as there are no differences in temperature from ISA, therefore indicated altitude = true altitude. Indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. Indicated altitude varies from pressure altitude by the amount of hPa difference multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which is 30 ft/hPa. 1013 - 1006 = 7 hPa 7 x 30 = 210 ft No temperature correction, so the aircraft's true altitude is 5000 - 210 = 4790 ft.",

It varies from true altitude by a difference in temperature from ISA, and varies from pressure altitude (flight levels) due to a difference in pressure setting between QNH and standard pressure setting (1013.25 hPa). If the QNH pressure is set, and the pressure changes but the pilot does not change the altimeter subscale, then the aircraft's true altitude will change without the pilot noticing. This is the same for temperature changes. The rule for both pressure and temperature changes is: High to Low, Beware Below. This means that any decrease in pressure or temperature will cause our true altitude to decrease, and vice-versa. So in this scenario, the static pressure decreasing would cause our true altitude to decrease without the altimeter needle moving. The radio altimeter is not affected by such errors though, and will be a very useful indication of our true altitude, especially whilst flying over the sea. A decreasing radio altimeter indication therefore means that either the radio altimeter is broken, or the pressure is decreasing.

            ],
            "explanation": "Northern Hemisphere: High pressure areas (anticyclones) turn in a clockwise direction. Low pressure areas (cyclones) turn in an anti-clockwise direction. If you stand with your back in the wind, the low-pressure area is on your left-hand side. Therefore, if the wind is coming from the right, such as in this question, the aircraft is flying from low pressure to high pressure. That means that an aircraft flying with a constant pressure setting (1013 hPa when using flight levels) will appear to be at the same altitude on the altimeters (set to 1013), but their true altitude will gradually increase. The nice thing about this question is that we do not have to consider temperature effects on our true altitude, as they have already been accounted for. The wind at FL190 is decided by the pressure patterns at that level, and the pressure patterns are decided partly by the surface pressure, and partly by the temperature of the air between the surface and FL190. All this means that the temperature effects on pressure altitude vs true altitude have already been accounted for in the wind direction, and therefore with a strong crosswind from the right, the aircraft's true altitude will be increasing (unfortunately, this is not the same in all altimetry questions, as some refer to surface pressure differences between two locations). To go through the options: \"The aircraft's true altitude will be increasing.\" Correct, as explained above. \"The altitude indicated on the aneroid altimeter will be decreasing.\" The aneroid altimeter just means a barometric altimeter. At this altitude, altimeters are set to 1013 hPa, so will remain constant at 19 000 ft (FL190). \"The radio altimeter will show an altitude increase.\" Radio altimeters do not usually function at this level. In civilian aircraft they are often limited to below 2500 ft. It would also be affected by ground features and elevation, even if it did work. \"The pressure altitude will be increasing.\" The pressure altitude will remain constant, as they are flying a constant flight level, which is a constant indicated altitude.",

At his time the atmosphere has been without the heat of the sun for the longest time. The ground gathers no solar energy but continues to radiate away its stored heat. The lowest temperature of the day usually occurs then. But why is this temperature after sunrise, you might think? At dawn, when the first light beams across the landscape, the incoming solar radiation is very weak. It does not yet have enough strength to counter all the heat escaping from the surface. As a result, the surface continues to lose heat for some time following sunrise, and the air temperature continues to fall. At some point, the solar rays shine strongly enough to counter the heat loss. The gain-loss balance is shifted, and the air finally begins to warm up.",

Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1023 hPa - 1013 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­270 ft.

To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (25 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-35 ºC.

An atmospheric pressure expressed in terms of altitude which corresponds to that pressure in the Standard Atmosphere. We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. In the case of this specific question: Because QNH at Palma de Mallorca is the same as in Marseille the pressure is not changed. If, however the true altitude is constantly increasing this would mean that the temperature must be changing. The only way the true altitude is increasing is if the temperature is increasing (warmer than ISA altimeter will under read). Because we now know the altimeter functions correctly no actions should be taken. The increase of true altitude is due to the warmer air mass over Palma de Mallorca.",

QFE: The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. QNE: The indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013,25 is set in the altimeter’s subscale. In other words, it is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold. QFF: Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature. If the airfield is at MSL => QFE, QNH and QFF will all be the same pressure. The temperature could be more or less than +15ºC and the pressure could be more or less than 1013.2hPa; it doesn't have to be ISA conditions. Let's now see why: QFE is the pressure value at the airfield; QNH is a QFE value which has been brought to MSL using ISA conditions; If you were to use actual conditions, QFF would be obtained instead. Imagine that you are in an airfield at MSL, you measure QFE and obtain i.e. 1020 hPa Now, reduce it to MSL with standard conditions to obtain QNH. You are already at MSL, the value is the same. Reduce it to MSL with real conditions to obtain QFF => again, you are already at MSL, the value will not change.",

A lower than standard temperature will result in a shallower descent angle and reduced descent rate. Conversely, a higher than standard temperature will result in a steeper angle and increased descent rate. Pilots should consider potential consequences of these effects on approach minima, power settings, sight picture, visual cues, etc., especially for high-altitude or terrain-challenged locations and during low-visibility conditions.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 16 200 ft (14 200 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (6 500 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (6 500/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+2ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-23ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -25ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 200 ft - 6 500 ft = 9 700 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (9 700/1000) = -970 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­17 170 ft. The minimum indicated altitude in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2000 ft is 17200 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -9ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-9) × (10 600/1000) = -382 ft.

The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 18 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 486 ft.

When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop and resulting air density decrease. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude, leaving the airplane at a lower altitude than indicated. This effect mirrors flying from a high-pressure system to a lower-pressure system. Consequently, if the pilot maintains a constant indicated altitude, the true altitude will decrease. The barometric pressure drop when encountering the venturi effect in a mountainous area can be as much as 33 hPa in extreme cases, leading to a dangerous altimeter error of as much as a thousand feet.",

If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). We know the following about pressure and temperature: When an aircraft is in a lower pressure area, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a higher-pressure area, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. When an aircraft is in a colder airmass than ISA, the altimeter will overread. The aircrafts true altitude will be lower than indicated. When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. We leave A with a QNH of 986 hPa set on the altimeter. We maintain an indicated altitude of 4 500 feet. Over B the QNH changes to 1011 hPa, but we still maintain with 986 hPa set on the altimeter. The true (actual) altitude of the aircraft at B will change now by: 1011 – 986 = 25 hPa. Close to the ground 1 hPa represents 27 feet. 25 x 27 = 675 feet Because the we are flying to the higher-pressure area without changing our altimeter our true altitude will increase by 675 feet. So, we will actually be flying at 4500 + 675 = 5 175 feet. The question asks for the height of the aircraft above the surface at B (elevation = 690 ft), 5 175ft – 690ft = 4 485 feet. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 8 000 ft. This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level (FL100). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­-5 ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-24ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -19ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -19ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-19) × (8 000/1000) = -608 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 608 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 621 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 8 608 ft + 621 ft = 9 229 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 9 229 ft, which is FL100. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Since the capsule is sealed, the pressure inside remains constant. This pressure differential causes the capsule to expand. Conversely, as the aircraft descends and the outside pressure increases, the capsule contracts. These changes in the capsule’s shape are mechanically linked to the altimeter's needle or digital display, translating the pressure changes into altitude readings. The aneroid capsule is specifically sensitive to low pressure. This is because, at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is significantly lower than at sea level.

In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (2 420/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­+10ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­+9ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -1ºC. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -1ºC. The airfield elevation must be taken into account for temperature correction: 6 430 ft - 2 420 ft = 4 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-1) × (4 010/1000) = -16 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 6 446 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 994 hPa = 19 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 19 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 513 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 6 446 ft + 513 ft = 6 959 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level below 6 959 ft, which is FL70. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 30 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­810 ft.

To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude (5 000 ft). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (5 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+5ºC.

However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach.

Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure. Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True. In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question, they give us a transition altitude (which would be an indicated altitude), and want us to calculate the corresponding pressure altitude (as that is what the pilot changes to whilst climbing through the transition altitude). This difference requires a barometric (pressure) correction, between the QNH of 1028 hPa and the standard pressure setting of 1013 hPa. A good way to remember the next part is to think that indicated altitude is based on QNH, so whenever QNH is high (higher than 1013), indicated altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when QNH is lower than standard. ==> When QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is greater than Pressure Altitude. ==> When QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, Indicated Altitude is lower than Pressure Altitude. The amount of change is calculated using the difference in pressure multiplied by the amount of ft per hPa, which in this case is given as 27 ft per hPa. If it is not given, it should be assumed to be 30 ft per hPa. 1028 - 1013 = 15 hPa 15 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 405 ft QNH is high, so Indicated Altitude is high, so the Pressure Altitude is 405 ft lower than 6 000 ft. 6 000 - 405 = 5 595 ft, closest answer 5 600 ft",

This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +24ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 254 ft - 3 100 ft = 5 154 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+24) × (5 154/1000) = 495 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 759 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 22 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 759 ft + 660 ft = 8 419 ft. As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level above 8 419 ft, which is FL85. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. During the departure we climbed through the transition altitude (18 000 feet) and we switched from a local QNH setting of 1023 to a standard setting of 1013,25. We return back to the aerodrome but at the transition level (FL190) we forget to switch back to the 1023 pressure setting on the altimeter. So, we will be landing with the altimeter still set to 1013 instead of 1023. Because we have a lower pressure set than actual, we already know that the altimeter will under read. True altitude will be higher than indicated (going from low to higher pressure). We know 1 hPa represents 27 feet near the ground so: 1023 – 1013 = 10 hPa X 27 = 270 feet So, when we land the altimeter will read 270 feet less than the elevation (323 ft) of the aerodrome. 323 – 270 = 53 feet indicated altitude after landing with 1013 still set on the altimeter.

The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of ­­­­2 664 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Due to the pressure decrease of 6 hPa at Palma de Mallorca we would expect that the aircraft's true altitude decreases 156 feet (6 x 27 = 156 feet). If the temperature at Marseille and Palma would be the same, the aircraft's true altitude would be 156 feet lower at Palma. However, the question states that the aircraft's true altitude does not change. Another way an aircraft’s true altitude can be changed is due to temperature => When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Now we know that the temperature at Palma de Mallorca must be higher than at Marseille as this is the only way that the aircraft's true altitude could be higher again and thus remain the same. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.

In the case of this specific question: The question states that the QFE is 980 hPa, and that Locarno is 200 metres above sea level. They ask us to calculate the QNH. Let's start by converting 200 m into ft. (1 metre is 3.28 feet) 3,28 x 200 = 656 feet We now want to know how many hPa correspond to 656 feet, therefore we divide it by 27 (27 is the amount of feet per 1 hPa close to the ground) = 24.3 hPa QNH = 980 hPa + 24.3 hPa = 1004.3 hPa = 1005 hPa approx.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

            "explanation": "During climb, pilots change the altimeter to standard pressure (1013 hPa) when passing through the transition altitude. Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL 050 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1030 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 5 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the surrounding traffic. In this case, the aircraft is referring to their indicated altitude rather than the pressure altitude they should be using. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1030 – 1013 = 17 hPa Using the assumed barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft The aircraft is 510 ft above or below the required flight level. to find this out, we can use the rules that state: When QNH is higher than standard --> Indicated altitude is higher than pressure altitude. When QNH is lower than standard --> Indicated altitude is lower than pressure altitude. The aircraft's indicated altitude is therefore higher than pressure altitude, so their actual pressure altitude is 510 ft lower than the required 5000 ft, making the pressure altitude 4490ft. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used unless specified otherwise in the question.",

True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. To calculate the aircraft’s true height, let's consider the indicated altitude (with QFE set) of 2000 ft. First, we need to determine the temperature correction. Given an ISA deviation of ISA -38°C and using the 4% rule, we calculate the height correction for temperature as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-38) × (2000/1000) = -304 ft. Since the ISA deviation is negative, the true height will be lower than the indicated altitude. Therefore, we subtract the temperature correction from the indicated altitude according to the rules, resulting in a true height of 1696 ft (2000 ft – 304 ft).",

Conduction is the transfer of heat between substances that are in direct contact with each other. In the atmosphere, the surface of the Earth and the atmosphere are in contact. During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern. Advection can be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced. Physical quantities characterizing it such as heat are also displaced with the air.",

            "explanation": "When an aircraft departs it is flying on a QNH value. Once it starts climbing it will pass through the transition altitude. Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa. So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting. You would now speak of flight level; the transition levels can be found on SID plates. This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: The question states the aircraft is descending so the altimeter will be reset at the transition level. Because the local QNH is 1009 (you came from a standard setting of 1013,25) you go from a higher pressure to a lower one. This means that the altitude shown on the altimeter will decrease.",

If the contours are high values (in comparison to other values on the chart) then we can assume a high pressure exists. The other way if the contours are lower values then we can assume a low pressure. If the contours are closely spaced, we can assume a high-pressure gradient exists.

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL120 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL120). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a warmer air mass, the deviation is a thicker layer, so we must add the temperature correction of 660 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 660 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

The tropopause height varies with latitude and season - and it is controlled by the temperature of the air near the surface. - The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. - The colder the air, the lower the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause. The tropopause occurs at approximately 20,000 feet over the poles and at approximately 60,000 feet above the equator. The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the Equator. The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) assumes that the average height of the tropopause is 36,000 feet, with a temperature of -56.5°C. Calculating the average tropopause height (ft): Tropopause height (ft) = (16 x cos Lat) x 3 280 for winter questions = subtract 3 000 ft; if summer = add 3 000 ft to the above result. Looking at the chart, we can see that the route from Recife to Dakar lies at around 3º. Tropopause height = (16 x cos 3º) x 3280 = 52 400 ft => In January, it is summer in Recife and winter in Dakar = we will choose the closest option to 52400 ft => 56 000 ft Note: the formula described in this explanation gives an approximate value.",

The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE DEFINITIONS. Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level. True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa. In this case, local pressure equals standard pressure (1013 hPa). Therefore, pressure correction is disregarded. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 39 000 ft - 5 000 ft = 34 000 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (34 000/1000) = 2 040 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules above, to give a true altitude of ­­­­­36 960 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 36 960 ft - 29 092 ft = 7 868 ft",

Thereafter, the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to flight level. It is important to note that the aircraft is not really flying at FL060 unless standard pressure is set (1013 hPa). Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1025 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. Let’s start by determining the difference between local QNH and standard pressure: 1025 – 1013 = 12 hPa Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft The aircraft is 6 000 ft – 5 640 ft = 360 ft lower than remaining traffic. Note 1: The local QNH (1025 hPa) is higher than the standard pressure (1013 hPa). This means that the local QNH datum is lower than the 1013 datum => the aircraft is lower than the remaining traffic. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used.",

If the temperature is warmer than ISA, then the true altitude is higher than the indicated altitude. If temperature is colder than the ISA, then true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude. On warm days the air expands and is less dense than on a cold day, and consequently raises the pressure levels. For example, the pressure level for 5 000 feet will be higher than on a day with standard conditions; the altimeter may indicate 5 000 feet when the airplane is actually at 6 000. One way to remember the effects of temperature in relation to true altitude is the mnemonic: “From hot to cold, high to low (pressure), look out below.”",

If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated The same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a high pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be increasing. Thus, true altitude will increase.

When air is forced into a narrow channel (i.e. valley) or is accelerated over a ridgeline, the velocity of the air flow increases and the pressure decreases. This phenomenon is explained by Bernoulli's principle. The greater the increase in wind speed, the greater the pressure drop. A decrease in pressure can cause an overestimation of altitude. As altitude is calculated, when compared to the reference pressure setting (i.e QNH), when flying into lower pressure, the true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude.

To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

            "explanation": "Troposphere = the lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins can differ (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. Above the tropics the height of the tropopause can be as high as 20 km. Aircraft almost never fly at such high levels and thus this information is not important to know.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Subsidence inversions occur when high surface pressure is present. This brings divergence at the surface, causing the air column above the high pressure to subside. This air warms up at the DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) of 3ºC/1000ft, which means that the air quickly gets quite warm, often quite a bit warmer than the air near the ground. This temperature difference will eventually stop the air descending any further, and instead the air begins to spread outward in divergence, but with a layer of cooler air trapped underneath this inversion that has formed. The inversion usually exists at around 2 - 3 000 ft, and can bring a reduction in visibility due to haze and other particles in the air under the inversion. Therefore, the location and time of year for this would be anywhere that gets high pressure systems. Northern continents in Winter, such as Canada and Siberia tend to get very cold, bringing high pressure, so these are correct. Subtropical ocean areas include the belt of subtropical high pressure, so that is certainly correct. Therefore, this option is correct. The Polar regions do have high pressure systems, but less so during the Summer than in the winter. The Equatorial regions tend to have low pressure, due to the intense heating, and the location of the ITCZ (which is a product of this low pressure). Mountainous regions have very varied weather, but you wouldn't expect high pressure for every mountainous region during every season, so incorrect. Note that the Encyclopedia Brittanica quotes the following \"Subsidence inversions are common over the northern continents in winter and over the subtropical oceans; these regions generally have subsiding air because they are located under large high-pressure centres.\", so we can see where the question writer got this from.",

An increase of one causes an increase in the other. Now let's work it out. (1) First determine the difference in ft between actual elevation and standby altimeter indication: 243 ft – 164 ft = 79 ft (2) Determine the difference in hPa, assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 70 ft / 27 ft/hPa = 3 hPa (3) Since we want the altimeter to have a higher indication (243 ft instead of 164 ft), the altimeter setting must increase for the actual elevation to be shown: 1018 hPa + 3 hPa = 1021 hPa",

The remaining ozone (about 90%) resides in the stratosphere between the top of the troposphere and about 50 kilometres altitude. The large amount of ozone in the stratosphere is often referred to as the “ozone layer.” The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, it is also toxic to humans. This means that the ozone concentration at jet cruising levels can be enough to be hazardous to humans, as is detailed in Learning Objective 050.01.01.03.02. The ozone layer is found in the stratosphere. Refer to the annex above for a visual representation of a normal ozone distribution.",

This is called a Radiation Inversion and is the most common type of temperature inversion. The air which is just above the earth cools through contact with the cool surface. Air is a poor conductor of heat so only a thin surface layer of air is cooled leaving the air above almost unaffected and therefore warmer. Gentle breezes overnight can cause some mixing of the air near the surface leading to the cool layer becoming slightly thicker as the night progresses. Reduced visibility can be evident below the inversion layer. If the temperature of surface air drops below its dew point, fog may result. Cloudy skies and strong winds reduce the likelihood of a radiation inversion forming.",

For unsaturated air, the lapse rate is 3°C per 1000 feet; this is called the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR). However, when the parcel of air reaches its dewpoint (100% humidity) and becomes saturated, water vapour condenses, latent heat is released during the condensation process, which warms the air, and the lapse rate reduces to 1.8°C per thousand feet (SALR). At higher altitudes and latitudes, where there is generally less water content in the air, and therefore less latent heat to release, the SALR is closer to 3°C per thousand feet. The ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) is the actual rate at which the ambient temperature changes with height. The overall average (ICAO standard atmosphere) rate is a decrease of about 6.5°C/km (2°C per 1000 feet) up to the tropopause (11 km standard), but the rate varies greatly in different regions of the world, in different airstreams, and at different seasons of the year.

During the day, the air is warmed by the ground via conduction. At night, the surface cools faster than the air. Because of this, conduction cools the air from the ground to higher levels of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Convection occurs when warmer areas of a liquid or gas rise to cooler areas in the liquid or gas. Cooler liquid or gas then takes the place of the warmer areas which have risen higher. This results in a continous circulation pattern. Advection can be considered the horizontal motion of air. More precisely, it is an exchange by the motion of a mass by which air is displaced.

As the correct QNH will be set, there is no need to make any barometric corrections in this question, only one temperature correction is required. The ISA deviation is ISA -12°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (3500/1000) = 168 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 668 ft. Closest answer 3 670 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1 000 = _____ ft The indicated altitude for the above formula might not be known yet, so true altitude may be used instead. If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft. HIGHER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE > PRESSURE ALTITUDE LOWER PRESSURE; INDICATED ALTITUDE < PRESSURE ALTITUDE WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE Definitions Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set. Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set. True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.",

            "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (such as air or water) between areas of different temperature. Convection results from the tendency of most fluids to expand when heated—i.e., to become less dense and to rise. When two surfaces are heated unequally, they heat the overlying air unevenly. The process of convection begins at sunrise and continues as follows: The sun's radiation strikes the ground, heating it. As the ground's temperature warms, it heats the layer of air directly above it through conduction. Because surfaces like sand, rocks, and pavement become warmer faster than ground covered by water or vegetation, air at and near the surface heats unevenly. As a result, some pockets warm faster than others. The faster warming pockets become less dense than the cooler air that surrounds them and they begin to rise. These rising columns of air are called \"thermals.\" As the air rises, heat and moisture are transported upward (vertically) into the atmosphere. The stronger the surface heating, the stronger and higher up into the atmosphere the convection extends. (This is why convection is especially active on hot summer afternoons.) In the summer the sun activity is greater than in the other seasons. During noon 12:00 the sun is at its highest point. At this time solar radiation is highest and a sunburn occurs in the shortest amount of time. The temperature is at it hottest around afternoon (3pm) because the suns heat has built up since noon and more heat is present at the surface than is leaving it.",

To remember which way the pressure setting change is applied, remember that increasing the pressure setting in the subscale increases the altitude indicated on the altimeter. An increase of one causes an increase in the other. Now let's work it out. (1) First determine the difference in ft between actual elevation and standby altimeter indication: 252 ft – 162 ft = 90 ft (2) Determine the difference in hPa, assuming a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft/hPa: 90 ft / 30 ft/hPa = 3 hPa (3) Since we want the altimeter to have a higher indication (252 ft instead of 162 ft), the altimeter setting must increase for the actual elevation to be shown: 1018 hPa + 3 hPa = 1021 hPa",

            "explanation": "Conduction is one of the three main ways that heat energy moves from place to place. The other two ways heat moves around are radiation and convection. Conduction is the process by which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighboring atoms or molecules. Conduction occurs more readily in solids and liquids, where the particles are closer together than in gases, where particles are further apart. The rate of energy transfer by conduction is higher when there is a large temperature difference between the substances that are in contact. Since air is a poor conductor, most energy transfer by conduction occurs right near Earth's surface. Conduction directly affects air temperature only a few centimeters into the atmosphere During the day, sunlight heats the ground, which in turn heats the air directly above it via conduction. At night, the ground cools and the heat flows from the warmer air directly above to the cooler ground via conduction. \"Conduction has less of an effect in heating of the troposphere in comparison to convection.\" Correct. Convection plays a more significant role in the distribution of heat than conduction. \"At night the air can be cooled by conduction.\" Correct. At night, the ground loses heat and cools down, and this cooler ground can then cool the air directly above it through conduction. This process is more significant near the surface where the air is in direct contact with the cooler ground. \"The air is a good conductor of heat.\" Incorrect. Air is actually a poor conductor of heat. Gases, in general, have lower thermal conductivity compared to solids and liquids, meaning they do not transfer heat as effectively through conduction. \"Conduction always occurs at a constant rate.\" Incorrect. The rate of conduction depends on various factors, including the temperature gradient (the difference in temperature between two regions), the thermal conductivity of the material, and the cross-sectional area through which heat is being transferred. Thus, the rate of conduction can change based on these variables and is not constant.",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with season. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The average height of the tropopause is approximately 11 km (36 000 feet). 50° N is about half the average latitude (between 0 and 90) so we can say that at 50° N the average height of the tropopause is 11 km.",

The cold Highs weaken with increasing altitude (may turn into a LOW). Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards at lower heights they bulge downwards at greater heights => in a high pressure area, the pressure surface will bulge upwards at low level. However, low temperature at altitude gives low pressure at altitude, and if this effect is large enough, the pressure surfaces will become level with altitude and then start to bulge downwards. Warm anticyclones (so called because of the warm, subsided air aloft) over land areas typically bring spells of settled and often warm weather. These Highs are often almost stationary - often referred to as permanent. The warm Highs intensify with increasing altitude. Pressure surfaces (contours) are pushed up by high pressure and high temperature => Isobaric surfaces bulge upwards in all levels. Furthermore, isobaric surfaces bulging upwards => indicate High pressure and isobaric pressures bulging downwards indicate Low pressures.",

            "explanation": "QNH. The atmospheric pressure adjusted to mean sea-level. If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level. QFE. The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. So, it is used to get to know the height above the ground. In the case of this specific question: We need to figure out which of these conditions would give the highest QNH. QNH gives the elevation of the airport from mean seal level. QFE set on the altimeter on the ground would give an indication of 0 feet. QNH will always be a higher value than QFE as long as the airport is above mean sea level. Assuming a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa: (1) QFE of 1003 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate the QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1003 hPa = 1047 hPa (2) QFE of 1000 hPa, elevation 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 1000 hPa = 1044 hPa (3) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1200 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1200 by 27 ft/hPa 44 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1039 hPa (4) QFE of 995 hPa, elevation of 1600 feet. To calculate QNH we have to divide 1600 by 27 ft/hPa 59 hPa and then add this to the QFE of 995 hPa = 1054 hPa => A QFE of 995 with an elevation of 1600 feet will give the highest QNH indication. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used. However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

This setting indicates that the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the elevation of the airfield. We need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +12ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the aircraft and the airfield elevation will be taken into account: 2 000 ft (the aerodrome which is located 1000 ft AMSL but the aircraft is 2 000 ft above the airfield). Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (2 000/1 000) = 96 ft.

            "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). An altimeter will read an altitude of -69m with the QNH of 1018 hPa set on the altimeter. Because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. QFF is the pressure measured at the airfield adjusted to mean sea level according to the actual temperature conditions. Because of the decreased density/decrease in pressure drop the QNH has been made a lower number compared to QFF to let the airfield still read the correct elevation with QNH set. That way we know that the QFF must be higher than 1018 hPa. So, with warmer temperatures from an airfield below msl it means that QFF is at a higher pressure than QNH. QNH set will give you a negative height and as you climb to zero on your altimeter with QNH set, you will be below msl. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = ­­­270 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 16 000 ft - 270 ft = 15 730 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL160). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (16 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-17 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-27 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -10ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (15 730/1 000) = -629 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 15 730 ft - 629 ft = ­­­­­15 101 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question). To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 999 hPa remains set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 6 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same pressure altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to 1013 hPa (the aircraft’s Indicated altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. 6 000 ft = IA + 30 (999 - 1013) IA = 6 000 ft + 420 ft IA = 6 420 ft The aircraft is 6 420 ft – 6 000 ft = 420 ft higher than remaining traffic.

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 7 400 ft (5 400 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (7 400/1000) = -592 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­7 992 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 7 992 ft + 690 ft = 8 682 ft. According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290: For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.) For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.) The aircraft flies an easterly magnetic track. Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "IMPORTANTE NOTE: Here is a compilation of all the feedback we've gathered over the past few months: Portugal: 590 ft Poland: 590 ft Spain: 590 ft Greece: 590 ft LBA: 680 ft HCAA: 590 ft Austria: 590 ft We are not exactly sure why this would be the case between different authorities, but maybe there was a small change of number in the question (it can be sometimes minutely changed between questions). There is also the possibility that the states calculate their true altitude differently. There are a couple of places where the method could be modified ever so slightly, such as deciding which altitude to use as the ISA reference in the temperature correction. This could lead to a lower obstacle clearance answer, but very close to our own. We do still believe our method to be more correct though, given the way the ISA works. The incredibly small difference this makes means it is not usually a factor, and therefore never really talked about. This question gives us a planned Flight Level of 290 (pressure altitude 29,000ft) and some meteorological conditions, which we must use to calculate our true altitude, and then compare to the local highest terrain to find our terrain clearance at this altitude. To start with, we must make a barometric correction to turn pressure altitude into indicated altitude. The QNH is quoted as 982 hPa, which is 1013 - 982 = 31 hPa less than standard pressure. Because we are in low pressure, our indicated altitude is lower than our pressure altitude. Each hPa is 30ft of height (unless otherwise specified), so the indicated altitude is 31 x 30 = 930 ft lower than the pressure altitude. Indicated Altitude = 29,000 - 930 = 28,070 ft To make this into a true altitude, we must do a temperature correction for any ISA deviation, which we must first calculate. ISA at 29,000ft should be 15 - 2(29) = -43⁰C, but our OAT is 17⁰C colder than this at -60⁰C, therefore our OAT is ISA -17⁰C. As our temperature is lower than ISA, our true altitude will be even lower than our indicated altitude. Temperature correction = 4 x ISA Deviation x Height above QNH station (in thousands of feet). In this case, the QNH station is near sea level, so our temperature correction is 4 x -17 x 28.070 = (-)1909 ft Therefore, true altitude = 28,070 - 1,909 = 26,161 ft This makes our terrain clearance 26,161 - 25,460 = 701 ft, closest answer 590 ft Note: Correct option is updated according to the latest feedback. The correct answers were 540 ft and 680 ft before. We are not sure why the authorities are using 590 ft, as it is further away from the correct answer than the original feedback of 680 ft, but they do sometimes work in mysterious ways.",

Please report in the comments if you see this (or a similar style question in an exam, thank you.) To start, we need to know the flight level (pressure altitude), and then the expected ISA temperature calculated to check the temperature in the option. Calculator Trick This is more of a rule of thumb, you go down and across the calculator as shown in the annex above, and the numbers of the buttons are the hundreds of hectopascals, then you count up from 1 to 5, and those are the hundreds of flight levels. For instance, 700 hPa is approximately FL100, 500 hPa is FL 180 (which is close to FL200, a discrepancy of this method), 300 hPa is approximately FL300, etc. Note: 200 hPa actually equates to FL390, and 100 hPa equates to FL510, to be a little more precise. The others are very close, remembering the 500hPa = FL180. We can then use this method to calculate the flight level, and use the formula: ISA temp. = 15 - 2 (pressure altitude in thousands of feet) Also, remember that the ISA temperature reduces by 2ºC down to -56.6ºC, where it then becomes isothermal, so all altitudes above approx. 36 000 ft have an ISA temp of -56.5ºC, up to about 60 000 ft. Using these methods, At 700 hPa, the ISA temperature is -5ºC. At 500 hPa, the ISA temperature is -21ºC. At 200 hPa, the ISA temperature is -56.5ºC. (the ISA temperature does not drop below this value) At 300 hPa, the ISA temperature is -45ºC.",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. Conduction = The transfer of heat energy by direct contact. Convection = The transfer of heat by the motion of a matter, the mixing of liquids or gasses. Radiation = The transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation (waves). In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the stratosphere begins can differ. The height of the bottom of the stratosphere varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The lower boundary of the stratosphere is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The lower boundary of the stratosphere can be as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. The base of the stratosphere is therefore lower near the poles because of the low ground temperatures.",

Vertical position at or above the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels (QNE). When passing through the transition layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when cllimbing and in terms of altitudes (QNH) when descending. After take-off, the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes (QNH set) until the Transition Altitude (TA). Thereafter, the pilot shall change the altimeter setting to standard pressure (1013 hPa) and altimeter readings are communicated as flight levels. Pressure decreases with increasing height. Which means that when the pilot changes the altimeter setting from local QNH (1041 hPa), to a lower pressure (1013 hPa), the altimeter reading will decrease. (Increasing the subscale setting increases the altitude readout, decreasing the subscale setting decreases the altitude readout.) Altimeter reading = TA - Pressure difference: 1041 hPa - 1013 hPa = 28 hPa 28 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 840 ft Altimeter reading = 11 000 ft - 840 ft = 10 160 ft",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: The altitude where the tropopause begins differs (the tropopause is the lower boundary of the stratosphere, so just above the troposphere). The tropopause varies with latitude and with the seasons. It is situated where heating from conduction from above and convection from below balance out. Practically taken as the height where the temperature fall is less than 2°C per 1000 ft. The tropopause can be as high as 20 km (12 miles or 65,000 feet) near the equator The tropopause is around 10 km (6.2 miles or about 33,000 feet) above the ground at middle latitudes. The tropopause as low as 7 km (4 miles or 23,000 feet) at the poles in winter. 1. When we move from the equator to the north pole, the temperature at the ground decreases and thus will the altitude of the tropopause decrease. 2. Due to the overall decrease in temperature with altitude, the temperature at the tropopause is lower/colder equatorward and higher/warmer poleward.",

            "explanation": "Calculation of terrain clearance and lowest usable flight level: The aircraft must fly at 14 500 ft (12 500 + 2 000). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level. The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -25ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-25) × (14 500/1000) = -1 450 ft. In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­15 950 ft. Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 980 hPa = 33 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 33 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 990 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below: Pressure Altitude = 15 950 ft + 990 ft = 16 940 ft. The lowest suitable flight level in order to achieve an obstacle clearance of 2 000 ft is FL170. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

            "explanation": "“The Earth is heated by long-wave radiation from the Sun, but cooled by its own short-wave radiation into space.” Incorrect. Heat is transferred via radiation from the Sun to the Earth’s surface. Primarily, insolation can be considered the process via which the atmosphere is heated. The wavelength of radiated energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of whatever is emitting it. As the Sun is very hot, its radiations are of shorter wavelength than those from the Earth. “The Earth only radiates heat into space between sunset and sunrise.” Incorrect The Earth receives a large amount of energy from the Sun. and it is this energy that results in a warm, livable planet. However, only a certain amount of this energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and used to heat the Earth. About 70% is absorbed by the planet, and the remaining 30% is reflected back to space by various surfaces such as clouds, ice, and deserts. The Earth is constantly absorbing and radiating energy. “Cloud cover has NO effect on the amount of the Sun's radiated heat arriving at the Earth's surface.” Incorrect. Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth. Correct. “More heat is radiated into space from a warm surface than from a cold surface.” The temperature of an object dictates how quickly they will lose energy to their surroundings. Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects, and thus a hotter planet will shed more energy to space than a colder planet.",

SECOND METHOD: to simplify your calculations we suggest using the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) + (4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev) Where TA = True Altitude and IA = Indicated Altitude. “(4 x IA/1000 x ISA Dev)” can be disregarded in this case because temperature = ISA. TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH - Pressure Setting) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 (QNH – 1013) 4950 ft = 4500 ft + 27 QNH – 27351 QNH = 1030 hPa approx. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

When an aircraft is in a warmer airmass than ISA, the altimeter will under read. The aircrafts true altitude will be higher than indicated. Since we fly on Flight level 120 (1013,25 hPa on our altimeter) and we don’t change this setting, our indicated flight level will not change. But normally our actual flight level will change if we have non-standard conditions. Our local QNH is 1013. This is the same as according the ICAO standard atmosphere. So, until so far it is logical why the true altitude also indicates 12 000 feet. However, we have to realise that the temperature variation from ISA also affects our true altitude. In this case because true altitude = indicated altitude (and we already know the QNH value is according to ISA)we know that their cannot be any temperature deviation from ISA. True altitude (TA) would have been higher than indicated altitude (IA) if the temperature was warmer than ISA, and TA would have been lower than IA if the temperature was colder than ISA. And thus, the average temperature is the same as ISA.",

QNH is QFE reduced to mean sea level using the assumed conditions of standard atmosphere and the elevation of the airport. If the pilot sets the current QFE into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate zero when on the ground. When the pilot sets the current QNH into the altimeter setting window, the altimeter will indicate the elevation of the airport when on the ground. Therefore, in this case, with QNH set in the altimeter window, the altimeter will indicate 1 411 ft. We need to find out the QFE = the altimeter setting that will cause 0 ft indication. When we set a lower value into the altimeter window the altimeter indication decreases and vice versa (higher setting means a higher indication). In this case we need to reduce the altimeter indication by 1 411 ft => we need to reduce the altimeter setting value. Close to the surface 1 hPa = 27 ft, therefore 1 411 ft reading reduction means a reference value change of approx. 52 hPa (1 411 ft ÷ 27 ft) => QNH 994 hPa - 52 hPa = QFE 942 hPa.

There are 3 different types of altitude used by pilots: True Altitude - The actual altitude above msl (mean sea level). Indicated Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to QNH pressure. Pressure Altitude - The read-out of our altimeter when set to standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), used to dictate flight levels. It also goes in this order, we can adjust a Pressure Altitude by the pressure correction (any barometric difference between our QNH and 1013 hPa) to find Indicated Altitude, and we can adjust an Indicated Altitude for the temperature correction (temperature difference from ISA) to get our True Altitude. Both of these processes can also be reversed, but must occur in the order True -> Indicated -> Pressure, or Pressure -> Indicated -> True. In any altimetry question, it is important to know which altitude we are given, and also which altitude is required in the answer. In this question they have given us a Pressure Altitude of 3 300 ft, and also an Indicated Height of 3300 ft. Not only does that tell us that the QNH is the same as standard pressure setting (1013 hPa), but it also tells us that our QFE is also the same pressure, and therefore our airport is at sea level. This has the very nice effect of making height and altitude interchangeable. This simplifies the question into a temperature correction only, from Indicated Altitude to True Altitude. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA. ==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude. ==> When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. As this scenario has an OAT of 15ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. (There are a couple of different ways to calculate this, but they all use the same formula with shifted decimal places). Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA) So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 3.3 x 15 = 198 ft True Altitude is less than Indicated Altitude, so True Altitude (and also True Height) = 3 300 - 198 = 3 102 ft * Indicated Altitude between the aircraft and the point at which the pressure is measured, but in this scenario, that is sea level, so Indicated Altitude works. For example, if the pressure had been measured at 1 000ft, then the number 2.3 (thousands of feet) would be used instead of 3.3.",

The flight is performed maintaining a constant Indicated Altitude of 7 500 ft based on Point A's QNH of 1021 hPa (and that is all we need from Point A - elevation is irrelevant). In order to find out our height above the surface, we must calculate our True Altitude. Think of it this way: If we were to set our altimeter to the correct QNH of 983 hPa => the altimeter reading would decrease by the altitude equivalent to the difference in pressure: 1021 hPa - 983 hPa = 38 hPa Assume that close to the surface: 1 hPa = 27 ft 38 hPa x 27 ft = 1026 ft Which means, that our True Altitude = Indicated Altitude - Pressure Correction TA = 7500 ft - 1026 ft = 6474 ft The elevation at B is 1650 ft and the True Altitude of the aircraft is 6474 ft => which means that the aircraft height above the surface at B = 6474 ft - 1650 ft = 4824 ft Note: If QNH is higher than altimeter setting => True Altitude is higher than Indicater Altitude. If QNH is lower than altimeter setting => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. Alternatively, you can think of it this way: - You are at surface B with QNH properly set to local QNH of 983 hPa - the altimeter will read elevation 1650 ft AMSL. - Now, if you change altimeter setting to 1021 hPa (by turning the altimeter know clockwise - indicated altitude will increase). It will show 1650 ft + 1026 ft = 2676 ft => however, we are still on the ground. - We will now climb to 7500 ft (on current altimeter setting of incorrect QNH 1021).

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback for this question was incomplete, and therefore is likely to be different in the exam. We have had to assume that the OAT is measured at the aircraft and that the QNH was measured at sea level. These are not always the case, and were ambiguous in our feedback. The aircraft's indicated altitude is 4 500 ft. We know that the true altitude of the highest obstacle is 3 120 ft. We must therefore calculate the aircraft's true altitude from the indicated altitude, which is a simple matter of a temperature correction. In an ISA atmosphere, the temperature at the aircraft's altitude (4 500 ft) would be 15 - 2(4.5) = 6ºC. The actual outside air temperature is -4ºC, so the OAT is ISA -10ºC. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION A good way to remember this part is to think that true altitude is based on OAT, so whenever OAT is high (higher than ISA temp.), true altitude is high. The same relationship goes for when OAT is lower than ISA. ==> When OAT is higher than ISA, True Altitude is greater than Indicated Altitude. ==> When OAT is lower than ISA, True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude. As this scenario has an OAT of 10ºC colder than ISA, the True Altitude is lower than the Indicated Altitude. The calculation for how much lower goes like this. Temperature Correction = 4 x (Indicated Altitude* [in thousands of feet]) x (amount of degrees different from ISA) So for this calculation, Temp. Correction = 4 x 4.5 x 10 = 180 ft. 4500 - 180 = 4 320 ft, the aircraft's true altitude. 4 320 - 3 120 = 1 200 ft obstacle clearance",

To put this into prespective, when we reach the tropopause, the temperature lapse rate changes from 2ºC/1 000 ft to less than two-thirds of 1ºC/1 000 ft. This is what they mean by \"abrupt change\". As you can see in the attached figure, in the troposphere, the temperature first decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. That is why the temperature laps rate changes abruptly at the tropopause. Recent feedback added the option “temperature and pressure lapse rate change abruptly at the tropopause”, and we think the feedback indicated it as incorrect, as well as the fact that the temperature lapse rate is the major change (and the only one on the syllabus), and the pressure lapse rate is more complex and unlikely to change suddenly due to the beginning of this isothermal layer.",

            "explanation": "Troposphere = The lowest layer of our atmosphere. It stars at ground level and extends upward to about 10 km (this altitude differs) above sea level. Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere (which is 11 km at mid latitudes) to about 50km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of earths stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere. The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometres (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. In case of this specific question: Because ozone absorbs the suns radiation, the temperature in the stratosphere increases with increasing altitude as compared to the troposphere. Cold air is more dense than warm air. If a layer of cool air lies beneath a layer of warmer air, then those layers are statically stable, and there is little or no vertical motion, because the heavier layer is already at the bottom. The warm air over the cold air mass (as in this question is the case) acts like a cap, preventing vertical mixing and thus leads to a stable atmosphere. Stability of the atmosphere can also be defined using the relationship of ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate), DALR (Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate) and SALR (Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate): Absolute stability: The ELR is less than the SALR, the air is said to be absolutely stable, since the air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always be cooler than the surrounding air and will not go up. ELR is less than SALR => ELR is less than 1.8°C per 1 000 ft (0.6°C per 100 m). Relationship is: ELR < SALR < DALR. Absolute instability: The air, whether saturated or unsaturated, will always have a higher temperature than its surroundings. ELR is greater than DALR => ELR is greater than 3°C per 1 000 ft (1°C per 100 m). Relationship is: SALR < DALR < ELR. Conditional instability: ELR is between 1.8°C and 3°C per 1 000 ft. Relationship is: SALR < ELR < DALR. ELR is less than SALR in case of the stratosphere (ELR is a positive number, because temperature increases with altitude). Thus, the layer above the tropopause is absolutely stable.",

            "explanation": "In this location, at this time of year, the days can get quite hot, due to the proximity to the equator, and the general climate. The coolest time of the day is just after sunrise, and the ground and air heat up graddually until early afternoon, when the temperature begins to drop again. This means that between 08:30 and 11:00 local time, the temperature will have risen quite a bit. A rise in air temperature causes a reduction in air density, due to the increased collisions between particles, keeping them further apart. Reduced air density leads to a reduction in the amount of air particles flowing over an aircraft's wings, which leads to a reduction in ift. This means that an aircraft must fly faster to gain the same amount of airflow, to get the same amount of lift. this lengthens take-off distances as the aircraft has to reach a higher speed. The engines are even more affected by temperature rises and density reduction. both piston and gas turbine engines produce higher power when the air is colder (and therefore denser), as there is more oxygen to burn alongside the fuel. Gas turbine engines also become TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature) limited when temperatures get above a certain amount, and this leads to the engine having to reduce their thrust output to stop the turbine melting. Propellers are also affected in the same way as wings, by having reduced air, they produce less power. Therefore, no matter what type of aircraft is being referenced, the power/thrust output will be reduced by the higher heat in the middle of the day, and therefore the take-off climb performance will be degraded.",

Precipitation: Water vapor is the source of all precipitation, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail.

If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is warmer than ISA, the air is less dense and thus pressure will drop slower with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be higher than 1016 because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will under read, the altimeter would indicate a lower airfield elevation than 400m. If we set a higher QNH, than the temperature correction is compensated. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa).

            "explanation": "True altitude calculation from a Flight Level: In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude. The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 977 hPa = 36 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 36 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 1 080 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 1 080 ft = 3 920 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given altitude 1 600 ft. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (1 600/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­+11.8 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-10 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA approx. -22ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 3 920 ft - 1 600 ft = 2 320 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (2 320/1000) = -204 ft. The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3 920 ft - 204 ft = ­­­­­3 716 ft. Meaning that our clearance from the obstacle is 3 716 - 2 320 = 1 396 ft ⇒ closest answer 1 420 ft RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

The surface radiates heat away as infrared radiation, and therefore the surface cools down. The air in contact with the surface is now warmer than the surface, and so heat will begin to flow from the air to the surface by conduction. This takes heat energy away from the low level air, causing the temperature to drop below the dewpoint, forming fog. Air flowing over a cold surface does a similar thing. The warmer air flows over a colder surface, and heat flows by conduction from the air into the surface. This cools the lower layers of air, and causes the overall ELR (Environmental Lapse Rate) to decrease (as the lower air is already cold), often creating an inversion at the altitude where that cold air gradually returns to normal temperature. The lower ELR and potential for an inversion make the air more stable, as any air which is forced to rise (at the DALR or SALR) will then be colder than the surrounding air, so will sink again. This often gives rise to advection fog, where that low level air cools below the dewpoint.",

If the actual QNH is lower than 1013 hPa, then the true altitude is lower than indicated altitude. If the QNH is higher than 1013 hPa, then true altitude is higher than indicated The same logic can be used to answer this question. When flying into a low pressure area, the pressure (local QNH) will be decreasing. Thus, true altitude will decrease. In such questions it might help if you remember that turning the knob of the altimeter anti-clockwise (left), the subscale indication decreases and also the altitude indication decreases (needle turning left).",

Normally (because of the higher pressure) our true altitude would be higher than our indicated altitude. But our true altitude is still 13500 feet.

Consequently, if the pilot does not change the altimeter setting and 1013 hPa is set => when you reach an altimeter indication of 4 000 ft and level off, you will not be at the same altitude as the remaining traffic. To solve this exercise, we must find out what altitude the altimeter would indicate if the pilot changed the altimeter setting to the local QNH (the aircraft’s True Altitude). We suggest that you use the following formula: TA = IA + 27 (Local QNH – Pressure setting) Where; TA stands for True altitude, IA is Indicated altitude and 30 is the barometric lapse rate. TA = 4 000 ft + 27 (1030 hPa – 1013 hPa) TA = 4 459 ft The aircraft is 4 459 ft – 4 000 ft = 459 ft higher than remaining traffic.

You have the option to apply the temperature correction to FL230 and FL110 individually or to the layer thickness (FL230 - FL110). However, we recommend applying the temperature correction directly to the layer thickness as it is a more straightforward approach. In the case of a colder air mass, the deviation is a thinner layer, so we must subtract the temperature correction of 720 ft, giving us a layer thickness of 11 280 ft. RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations: All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA. For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.

In winter, inversions can last for a few days to several weeks, being triggered and maintained by anticyclonic conditions at synoptic scale. How does a Valley Inversion form? The temperature of the upper parts of the valleys in mountainous areas becomes exceedingly low during winter nights because of radid loss of heat from the surface through terrestrial radiation. Consequently, the colder and heavier air of the upper part of the valley descends along the mountain slopes. The temperature of the valley floor does not fall considerably because of comparatively low rate of loss of heat aloft and hence this warmer and lighter air of the valley floor is pushed upwards by the cold downslope winds. Thus, there is warm air aloft and cold air in the valley floor and a temperature inversion is caused.",

In this case, we will have ISA temperature at FL180 = 15 - 2 x 18 = -21ºC K = C + 273; K = -21ºC + 273 = 252 K Change in ft/hPa = 96 x 252/500 = 48 approx. Note that the formula above only gives an approximate result - which is close enough to answer this sort of questions and it is valid for ISA temperatures only. i.e. for a cold air, the pressure will fall more rapidly with altitude - and the distance between the molecules is less than in warm air.",

            "explanation": "This question is based upon you knowing the relationship between QFF and QNH. QFE is the pressure at the station (or aerodrome) level. QNH is the mean sea level pressure, derived by applying ICAO's standard atmosphere corrections to QFE. QFF is the mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. Considering the above definitions, we can say that, in ICAO's standard atmosphere, when landing at sea level with QNH set on your altimeter - it will read \"0 ft\". Now, this question states that actual temperature at 4 000 ft is -20ºC - Which means that the air is 27ºC colder than ISA (ISA temperature at 4000 ft = 15 - 2 x 4 = 7ºC). => Normally, a standard lapse rate of 1 hPa per 27 ft is used to calculate the difference between QNH and QFE. However, in cold and dense air, pressure changes more rapidly and the pressure change will be more than that. Thus in colder than standard temperature QFF is more than QNH. Since the QFF (actual pressure at MSL) will be higher than the QNH, when the aircraft reaches MSL, the ambient pressure will be higher than the value set on the altimeter (QNH), therefore, it will indicate a value less than zero. Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Insolation and clouds The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. The clouds then have an effect on the outgoing infrared radiation, by absorbing this radiation, and re-radiating it back down, creating a blanket around that section of the Earth. This is where a disagreement may occur, as that could be considered to be the clouds \"reflecting\" the infrared radiation back down, but in reality, they primarily absorb the infrared, and re-radiate it in all directions. SUMMARY The clouds reflect UV rays back into space The clouds absorb and re-radiate the infrared radiation from the Earth's surface.",

            ],
            "explanation": "QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). Because the airport is situated 400 meters above sea level with a QFF of 1016 and the question states the air temperature is 10 degrees lower than ISA, we can calculate the QNH. 400m x 3,285 = 1314 feet X 1,04 (4 % temperature correction for every 10 degrees below ISA) = 1366,6 feet / 27 (drop of 1 hPa according to ISA near the ground) = 50,6 hPa 1314 feet / 27 = 48,7 hPa 50,6 -48,7 = roughly 2 hPa. So, the QNH will be 1014 and the QFF = 1016. We do not need to do these time-consuming calculations because most of the questions just ask if the QNH would be more or less than QFF. Actual pressure at sea level = 1016 hPa, because the temperature is colder than ISA, the air is more dense and thus pressure will drop faster with altitude. QNH takes into account the International Standard Atmosphere average drop of 1hPa with 27 feet. Because at an airfield we still want to read the correct elevation above mean sea level of the aerodrome, the QNH has to be adjusted. The QNH in this case needs to be lowered (lower than 1016) because if you would set 1016 the temperature factor has not been taken into account and thus the altimeter will overread. Remember: ABOVE MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF < QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF > QNH BELOW MSL: Temp warmer than ISA => QFF > QNH Temp colder than ISA => QFF < QNH Note: According to the new syllabus (EASA 2020) a barometric lapse rate of 30 ft /hPa should be used (instead of 27 ft/hPa). However, if the question text indicates a different lapse rate, that is the one you are expected to use.",

Nearly all the weather occurs in this layer mainly because 99% of the water vapor is found here. With increasing altitude, the pressure normally drops and the temperature decreases. Stratosphere = The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere, it extends from the troposphere to about 50 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature rises, because of this the air here is very stable and there is almost no turbulence. This is the reason commercial passenger jets fly in the lower stratosphere. The lower boundary of the stratosphere is called the tropopause; the upper boundary is called the stratopause. Mesosphere = The layer above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, it extends from the stratosphere to about 85 km above the ground. With increasing altitude, the temperature decreases. The air pressure here is very low and the coldest temperatures in the Earth’s atmosphere are found here. Thermosphere = The layer above the mesosphere is the thermosphere, it extends from the mesosphere to about 600 km. The temperature here can get up to thousands of degrees. Exosphere = The layer above the thermosphere is the exosphere, it extends from the thermosphere up to 150 000 km above the surface of the earth. However, there is no clear upper boundary where the exosphere fades away into space. In the case of this specific question: As you can see in the image, the temperature first decreases with altitude in the troposphere, in the stratosphere the temperature increases with altitude. This is because the direct heat source for the stratosphere is the sun. Because the stratosphere contains ozone molecules, and these absorbs solar radiation, the temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere. So that is why the division between the troposphere and the stratosphere can be made according the temperature profile.",

The aircraft must fly at 5 920 ft (*obstacle elevation + terrain clearance). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for the temperature ISA deviation to get the indicated altitude. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (10) × (5920/1000) = 236.8 ft. The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of ­­­­­6156.8 ft. Closest answer 6 160 ft. RULES.

The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa + 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below: Indicated altitude = 10 000 ft - 690 ft = 9 310 ft. To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­0 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +5ºC. Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +5ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 9 310 ft - 1 500 ft = 7 810 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (5) × (7 810/1000) = 156 ft. The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 9 466 ft. Therefore, the height above ground = 9 466 ft - 5 000 ft = 4 466 ft (4 500 ft is the closest option). RULES.

Here the pilot needs to change from a local altimeter setting to a to a standard of 1013,25 hPa. So, above the transition altitude all aircraft will be flying on the same altimeter setting. You would now speak of flight level; the transition levels can be found on SID plates. This is done because now all the aircraft have the same reference and thus all altimeters will read the same at any given level despite there being differences in areas of high or low pressure. This is most important when flying for many hours traveling many miles, because you don’t constantly need to change your altimeter setting and the controllers know that they can assign you a level and your reference is the same as that of other aircraft. If we descent the pilot needs to change the altimeter back to the local QNH setting once he passes through the transition level (this is the lowest flight level above the transition altitude). ATC determines the transition level and broadcasts it on the ATIS. A transition layer is the space between the transition altitude and transition level. If you are climbing, you will pass the transition altitude and as you climb into the transition layer you set a standard altimeter setting. When an aircraft descent through the transition level the pilot switches to the local altimeter setting and passes again through the transition layer. In the case of this specific question: We go from a standard pressure setting of 1013,2 to the local QNH setting. The indication now changes from a flight level to an altitude.",

If you are on the ground at an airport and turn in the local QNH at your altimeter’s subscale, it will display the airports altitude above mean sea level. QFE = The pressure set on the altimeter so that it indicates the height above the reference elevation being used (height above current ground level). If you set the QFE on your altimeter’s subscale on the ground, the altimeter would read 0 feet. So, it is used to get to know the height above the ground. QNE =The indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013,25 is set in the altimeter’s subscale. In other words, it is the pressure altitude at the landing runway threshold. QFF = Mean sea level pressure, derived by taking into account the actual temperature conditions. So, the QFE reduced to mean sea level with regard to the actual outside air temperature. In case of this specific question: QFF is effectively the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the actual conditions occurring at the time. If you had the QFF set and landed on the sea your altimeter would read zero. QNH is the pressure measured at a specific datum (airfield, meteorological station etc) adjusted to sea level using the lapse rates etc of the International Standard Atmosphere. If you had the QNH set then at the airfield your altimeter would read the elevation of the airfield and if you landed on the sea it would only read zero if the actual conditions were the same as the ISA conditions ( that is if QNH=QFF). The question states that an airfield is located at mean sea level. Because of this there is no need for any temperature corrections because the airfield does not have any elevation. Thus, will the QNH be the same as the QFF and the same as the QFE.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 050.01.01.02.04: Describe the variations of the FL and temperature of the tropopause from the poles to the equator. The atmosphere is split up into many different layers. The lowest layer is the troposphere, followed by the stratosphere. In general, these are the two that pilots care about most. The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause, and is where the stratosphere begins. The atmosphere is not always the same height though, in fact it varies wildly in height between the tropics and the poles. Over the equator, the atmosphere is very tall, due to both heat (meaning that pressure reduces at a lower rate with altitude) and other effects such as convection and general circulation of air. The atmosphere over the poles has much less height, this is mostly to do with the reduced convection and the cold air, which loses pressure more quickly with altitude. The height of the troposphere (which is indicative of the atmosphere in general) will therefore change from season to season, as solar heating differs due to the angle of the sun to the ground. In the winter season, in general a hemisphere will have a lower tropopause, and in the summer, a higher tropopause. This also coincides with how close a particular place is to the ITCZ, the heat equator, which moves with the seasons. In the tropics, the tropopause reaches around FL550 in summer, dropping a little in the winter, depending on where in the tropics. At the poles, it can drop to as low as FL200 around the winter time, and up to around FL250 in the summer. The ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) has the tropopause at 36 090 ft, which is a good average for areas at 40-50º Latitude (above this in summer, below it in winter). Therefore FL250 to FL350 sounds plausible for 55º N, which equates to the South of Scotland, or around the latitude of Denmark. Note: You only need a rough idea of tropopause heights for this question (especially as two answers can be removed for having higher winter heights than summer heights, which is not correct) and the learning objective above is vague, but does not require memorizing a table or any such deep knowledge.",

Terrestrial Radiation The Earth radiates energy into the atmosphere in the form of terrestrial radiation. It is more readily absorbed by the atmosphere especially by clouds, water vapour and carbon dioxide that solar radiation due to its longer wavelength. The absorption of heat by the atmosphere from the Earth is the main heat exchange mechanism that causes weather. Any terrestrial radiation not absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere escapes back into space. SUMMARY Insolation: sun warms the Earth; Radiation: Earth loses heat, radiates heat. During the day, insolation predominates over radiation; hence Earth gets warmer. At night, radiation predominates; Earth cools down. On the average, however, (within a year) insolation and radiation are approximately in balance but it fluctuates during a year (seasonal).",

Learning Objective 050.01.02.06.01: Explain the cooling/warming of the surface of the Earth by radiation. Insolation The Sun emits electromagnetic waves of many different wavelengths, and the vast majority of the energy comes in the form of short wavelength (high frequency) radiation. This does not heat the atmosphere directly. We can refer to this short-wave radiation as ultraviolet (UV), as that is what makes up quite a lot of it. The UV rays are somewhat absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere, reflected off clouds back into space, and the rays which are reach the ground either are reflected or absorbed by the ground (approximately half of the incoming radiation is absorbed). This heats the ground, which then produces much lower frequency (longer wavelength) infrared radiation, heating the air in the atmosphere via infrared radiation, conduction and convection. Therefore, for this question, the short-wave radiation from The Sun heats the Earth, and the Earth loses it's heat through long-wave radiation (amongst other forms of heat loss).",
