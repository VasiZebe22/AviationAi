The aircraft commander may, when he has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed, or is about to commit, on board the aircraft, an offence or act contemplated in Article 1, paragraph 1, impose upon such person reasonable measures including restraint which are necessary: (a) to protect the safety of the aircraft, or of persons or property therein; or (b) to maintain good order and discipline on board; or (c) to enable him to deliver such person to competent authorities or to disembark him in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. Article 9 1. The aircraft commander may deliver to the competent authorities of any Contracting State in the territory of which the aircraft lands any person who he has reasonable grounds to believe has committed on board the aircraft an act which, in his opinion, is a serious offence acccording to the penal law of the State of registration of the aircraft. The regulations also allow the commander the ability to require the assistance of other crew members, and request the assistance of passengers in security matters as described above.

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 010.01.04.01.03: State that the structure of the regulatory material related to EASA involves: hard law (regulations, delegated acts, implementing acts, and implementing rules); soft law (certification specifications, acceptable means of compliance, and guidance material). This learning objective is referring to the fact that EASA produce legally binding 'hard law' as well as non-legally binding 'soft law' to provide extra guidance. The types of each are well listed in the learning objective. In this question, it quotes 'obligations' as being hard law and 'specifications' as being soft law. Soft law is a slightly strange concept, but is mostly used in international law making, as each country has their own law system, and extra guidance is needed to be able to make these laws work in each country. The 'Basic Regulation' is Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91. Under the EU legal order, the Basic Regulation has general application. It is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. The main objective of the Basic Regulation is to “establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union” — Article 1(1) \"The Basic Regulation\" is an example of \"hard law\", completely legally binding. EASA also publish (in a different place) the soft law to go alongside this, in the form of acceptable means of compliance, certification specifications and guidance material. Note: This question is certainly asking about the hard law vs soft law learning objective above, but comes dangerously close to asking about \"The Basic Regulation\", which is another name for a specific regulation from 2018. In reality, none of the other options actually work, so we do not have to work too hard to get this question right. Of course, any further exam feedback on any such question is always useful, and can be put in the comments or sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.",

Parts (a) and (b) both describe documents that must be carried, which include the valid licence and valid medical, as well as the photo ID. A common misconception is that a pilot must also carry their paper logbook, but actually, the regulation staes that they must present their flight time record without undue delay, which can have some interpretation, but means that an electronic version can be carried instead, etc. For this reason, the more correct answer is licence, medical, and photo ID.",

To go through the other options: \"a management system in which the flight crew makes optimum use of all the available resources both on ground and in the aircraft.\" It looks like that this is describing CRM (Crew Resource Management), an important part of learning MCC (Multi-Crew Cooperation), but not the definition. \"the functioning of the flight crew as a team of cooperating members lead by the pilot-in-command.\" Correct. This is the exact definition of MCC as shown above from Part-FCL. \"a method of avoiding undesired aircraft states by identifying and managing threats and errors.\" This is one we made up to fill in the gap in feedback, it is a loose definition of threat and error management. \"a management style where the pilot-in-command controls all the decisions and takes very few inputs from other crew members.\" Another one we made up, a definition of an autocratic leadership style in the cockpit.",

This is the exact definition of MCC as shown above from Part-FCL. \"a method of avoiding undesired aircraft states by identifying and managing threats and errors.\" This is one we made up to fill in the gap in feedback, it is a loose definition of threat and error management. \"a management style where the pilot-in-command controls all the decisions and takes very few inputs from other crew members.\" Another one we made up, a definition of an autocratic leadership style in the cockpit.",

Source: SERA.5001 VMC visibility and distance from cloud minima; SERA.5005 Visual flight rules; SERA.5010 Special VFR in control zones Special VFR (SVFR) Special VFR is defined by ICAO as a VFR flight cleared by ATC to operate in controlled airspace in conditions that are less than VMC. SVFR is only applicable to flights entering or departing the control zone. The minimum visibility prescribed by ICAO is 1500 m, lower than the 5 km (or 3 km in certain cases) required for VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions). When outside of a suitable control zone then, the procedure for loss of VMC is to do an immediate 180° turn (or whatever is best) and remain VMC, finding a VMC airfield to land at. Inside a control zone, however, there is an option to accept worse meteorological conditions, SVFR. A special VFR clearance allows an aircraft to depart from or arrive at a controlled aerodrome via a control zone, but is subject to many restrictions, including the amount of aircraft in the control zone, etc. It is also very low visibility, so must be flown carefully, and slowly where possible to give a good time to spot obstacles.",

However, we have received a report from a student stating that it appeared in their Air Law exam. If any of you encounter this question during your Air Law exam, kindly inform us. Thank you! Performance Based Communications and Surveillance (PBCS) PBCS standards were introduced in the NAT HLA for aircraft that meet the “Required Communication Performance” (RCP) and “Required Surveillance Performance” (RSP) specifications which ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. Performance-based operations and monitoring have been implemented in the NAT HLA to ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. The performance of FANS equivalent, CPDLC, and ADS-C aircraft are monitored in the NAT HLA against RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications. Separation of PBCS aircraft remains an air traffic control function and responsibility. When an aircraft does not meet RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications, ATC shall provide standard separation criteria. Aircrew must report any failure or malfunction of GNSS, ADS-C, or CPDLC equipment to ATC as soon as it becomes apparent. For aircraft planning to operate in the NAT HLA, PBCS capabilities, when operational, are reflected in the ICAO flight plan as follows: Item 10a: FANS designator (e.g., J7); FANS CPDLC RCP 240 compliance designator (e.g., P2) Item 10b: FANS ADS-C compliance (D1 or G1 for ATN systems) Item 18: FANS ADS-C RSP 180 compliance (SUR/RSP180); FANS 4 compliance (PBN/L1)",

            ],
            "explanation": "In cold air: The glide path / descent path will be shallower. The true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude. 1. The glide path / descent path will be shallower: The thrust (power) produced by the aircraft engine is constant (flat), as ambient temperature increases, up to a certain temperature. If the turbine inlet temperature limit is reached, the fuel flow and thrust produced by the engine is reduced as the ambient temperature continues to increase. Hot Temperatures: As ambient temperature increases, the density of the air decreases. The turbine inlet temperature limit can be reached, restricting the engine's performance. Consequently, at hot temperatures, the aircraft will generally experience a steeper glide path or descent path due to the reduced thrust. Cold Temperatures: Conversely, cold air is denser, allowing the engine to produce the maximum thrust for a given power setting. This results in a more efficient performance and a shallower glide path or descent path compared to hot temperatures. 2. The true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude: True Altitude is the real distance beneath the aircraft to the ground. Indicated altitude is only the same as true altitude if the temperature and pressure conditions are equal to the ISA conditions. If the temperature is warmer than ISA, then the true altitude is higher than the indicated altitude. If temperature is colder than the ISA, then true altitude is lower than the indicated altitude. The altimeter measures atmospheric pressure and converts it into an altitude reading. On warm days, the air expands and becomes less dense. Consequently, for the same pressure level, the aircraft will be at a higher altitude than the altimeter indicates because the pressure at that altitude will be higher than under standard conditions. On cold days, the air is denser. As a result, for the same pressure level, the aircraft will be at a lower altitude than the altimeter indicates because the pressure at that altitude will be lower than under standard conditions. The altimeter may read a higher altitude than the aircraft’s true altitude. Mnemonic: 'From hot to cold beware below'",

To sum up, national rules of the air shall always prevail over ICAO's rules of the air. In other words, ICAOs rules of the air are implemented in EASAs SERA, which is applicable in Europe. By way of example: if an aircraft registered in Switzerland flies over the airspace of Switzerland, the Swiss rules will apply. If the same aircraft flies across the border and enters Austrian airspace, both Austrian and Swiss rules will start to apply but Austrian rules will take precedence. Naturally, if these two sets of rules are standardized in the spirit of Annex 2, the situation is less complicated. Once the same aircraft flies into the airspace of high seas, ICAO rules shall apply without question. NOTE: We received feedback that the items given in this question in the official exam conducted by the Polish authority were ordered differently. The order is as follows; 1. Standardised European Rules of the Air (SERA) 2. Rules of the Air published by Libya 3. Rules of the Air for the High Seas 4. Rules of the Air published by Italy 5.

When it becomes evident that flight in VMC in accordance with its current flight plan will not be practicable, a VFR flight operated as a controlled flight shall: (1) request an amended clearance enabling the aircraft to continue in VMC to destination or to an alternative aerodrome, or to leave the airspace within which an ATC clearance is required; or (2) if no clearance in accordance with a) can be obtained, continue to operate in VMC and notify the appropriate ATC unit of the action being taken either to leave the airspace concerned or to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; or (3) if operated within a control zone, request authorisation to operate as a special VFR flight; or (4) request clearance to operate in accordance with the instrument flight rules. \"Request special VFR.\" Incorrect. Special VFR (SVFR) clearance can be requested for flights at airspeed less than 140 kt. \"Request IFR clearance.\" Incorrect. You need good weather to pick up your clearance in the air. You cannot punch into the clouds without a clearance! Period. That is why getting your clearance on the ground is advantageous, you are cleared from the moment you take off to fly into the clouds. That rule doesn’t apply when you pick up your clearance in the air. You are a VFR aircraft and you must maintain your VFR Cloud clearance until you receive your clearance.",

Outside of these conditions, it can be requested for an aircraft to follow published noise abatement procedures, and in this case, that is very likely, due to the time of the day, and the favourable conditions on everything other than wind. Of course, if the aircraft cannot take-off from that runway with a 4kt tailwind for performance reasons, for instance, then it is a different story, but that is not part of the question.

In the case of precision approach and circling approach procedures, an OCA/H is specified for each category of aircraft listed in 1.4. Obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/H) is: a) in a precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold (OCH), at which a missed approach shall be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or b) in a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above aerodrome elevation or the elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2 m (7 ft) below the aerodrome elevation (OCH), below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or c) in a visual (circling) procedure, the lowest altitude (OCA) or alternatively the lowest height above the aerodrome elevation (OCH) below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. The different definitions for the OCA/H vary depending on the type of approach, but OCA is always based on QNH (mean sea level) and OCH is in reference to QFE (aerodrome elevation). It is important to note that the OCA/H is not always the same as Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H), but a DA/H will never be lower than the corresponding OCA/H.",
