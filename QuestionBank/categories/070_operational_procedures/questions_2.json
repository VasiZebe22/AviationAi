This question references Learning Objective 071.01.02.02.07 which states: 'Explain which are the operator requirements regarding the management system.' An operator is considered non-complex or complex depending on the size and scale of the operation. One of the important aspects of this distinction, is the requirement for management structure. For example, a start up company with one owner / pilot and one aircraft is clearly non-complex and the owner / pilot will have to fulfil many of the management functions. A large, complex company such as Air France, British Airways etc will require a very different management structure covering areas such as flight operations ground operations maintenance training AMC1 ORO. GEN.200(b) Management system SIZE, NATURE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTIVITY (a) An operator should be considered as complex when it has a workforce of more than 20 full time equivalents (FTEs) involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200848 and its Implementing Rules. (b) Operators with up to 20 FTEs involved in the activity subject to Regulation (EC) No 216/200849 and its Implementing Rules may also be considered complex based on an assessment of the following factors: (1) in terms of complexity, the extent and scope of contracted activities subject to the approval; (2) in terms of risk criteria, the extent of the following: (i) operations requiring a specific approval; (ii) high-risk commercial specialised operations; (iii) operations with different types of aircraft used; and (iv) operations in challenging environment (offshore, mountainous area, etc.).",

            "explanation": "Note: This is a question from Meteorology that has also been seen in Ops recently. RVR is a special measure of visibility in the direction of the runway. As prevailing visibility is usually used, which is approximately the average visibility in all directions from the station, this can be a bit inaccurate, as the visibility can vary massively between two different directions, due to different density of obscuration, perhaps. This is why, when the visibility is below 1500 m, the RVR is reported also, as the RVR (Runway Visual Range) is a measure of the exact visibility directly down the runway, and usually is measured at 3 different places on the runway, touchdown zone, midpoint, and stop-end. This is almost always higher than the prevailing visibility, as it only has to consider the visibility in one direction. These days, it is automatically measured by devices alongside the runway, called transmissometers (the newer versions are called scatterometers). In terms of this question, the runway visual range is often measured by counting the amount of centreline markings or lights that can be seen ahead of the aircraft, so those two answers must be correct. Also, the next closest answer is the runway edge lights, which you should be able to see also. The other options are either to the side of the runway (in a direction where visibility is not assured), or behind the aircraft when lined up.",

            "explanation": "PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM The cabin’s fixed oxygen system supplies oxygen to the occupants, in case of cabin depressurization. Most air transport aircraft use Chemical generators to provide passengers with oxygen (Boeings use gaseous). Generators and masks are in containers above the passenger seats, in the lavatories, in each galley, and at each cabin crew station. OPERATION For Chemical Oxygen Systems, each container has an electrical latching mechanism that opens automatically to allow the masks to drop, if the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15 000 ft. The flight crew can override the automatic control. A manual release tool allows crewmembers to manually open the doors in case of electrical failure. The generation of oxygen begins when the passenger pulls the mask towards the passenger seat. Once the generator is activated, the flow of oxygen is constant (whether or not the mask is being worn) for approximately 15 minutes, until the generator is exhausted. In line with the oxygen supply to the passenger mask, there is a small bag. This should partially inflate during use, indicating that there is a supply of oxygen. A mixture of oxygen together with cabin air will be supplied. Thus the masks will not protect the passenger from smoke and fumes. The chemical reaction used for oxygen generation creates heat (the generator itself incorporates a heat shield). Therefore, the smell of burning or smoke, and cabin temperature increase, may be associated with the normal operation of the oxygen generators.",

            "explanation": "There are 2 aspects to be clear on, in order to answer this question: 1. After take-off, the requirement is to use the operating minima only. The ceiling is taken into account only for ETOPS, Non-Precision & Circling approaches in planning minima. The following table is a summary for the application of planning and operating minima. Stage of flight? Pre-flight (in the ops room) Dispatch / taxiing After take-off / en-route Which minima? Planning minima Planning minima Operating minima Time? +/- 1 hour ETA ETA Operating minima is Visibility / RVR only. 2. Continuation of approach: Under European regulations, you can always commence an approach. However, to continue the approach below the outer marker (not below 1000 ft above the aerodrome) then the reported visibility / RVR must be the same or greater than what is required for the approach. For example: you are flying a CAT I ILS, with a DH of 200 ft and an RVR of 550 m. On the approach, ATC report RVR 400 m - you may not descend below 1000 ft. If they report RVR 600 m, then you may descend below 1000 ft agl and continue down to DH. At DH, further descent is based on seeing the required visual references. The idea behind this regulation is to prevent low approaches in visibility conditions that will likely result in a go-around. Cloud base and ceiling are not a factor - only visibility / RVR. Note: Once below 1000 ft agl, if the visibility / RVR now decreases to below minima, then you can continue down to DH anyway. In this question - you are flying a non-precision approach, but the ceiling / MDH are not relevant as you are using operating minima. The reported visibility of 1800 m exceeds your required 1500 m so you may continue down to minimums. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP. MPA.305 Commencement and continuation of approach (a) The commander or the pilot to whom conduct of the flight has been delegated may commence an instrument approach regardless of the reported RVR/VIS. (b) If the reported RVR/VIS is less than the applicable minimum the approach shall not be continued: (1) below 1 000 ft above the aerodrome; or (2) into the final approach segment in the case where the DA/H or MDA/H is more than 1 000 ft above the aerodrome. (c) Where the RVR is not available, RVR values may be derived by converting the reported visibility. (d) If, after passing 1 000 ft above the aerodrome, the reported RVR/VIS falls below the applicable minimum, the approach may be continued to DA/H or MDA/H. (e) The approach may be continued below DA/H or MDA/H and the landing may be completed provided that the visual reference adequate for the type of approach operation and for the intended runway is established at the DA/H or MDA/H and is maintained. (f) The touchdown zone RVR shall always be controlling. If reported and relevant, the midpoint and stop end RVR shall also be controlling. The minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 125 m or the RVR required for the touchdown zone if less, and 75 m for the stop end. For aircraft equipped with a roll out guidance or control system, the minimum RVR value for the midpoint shall be 75 m",

Here we are asked who would be the post-holder responsible for the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programme. This is describing the safety manager. The safety manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SMS safety management system, which includes FDM. For a smaller operator (Non complex) this is typically the accountable manager or a line Captain. Both of these positions offer sufficient relevant experience in operational roles to be an effective safety manager. For a larger operator (Complex) this position would now need a more dedicated specialist due to the size or type of operation. Now the operator will need a safety manager and safety review board.

The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1)aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2)the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3)the direction to an alternate airport; 4)any strategic lateral offset being flown and, 5)terrain clearance 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK If possible maintain the assigned flight level until established on the 9.3 km (5.0 NM) parallel, same direction track or route offset. If unable, initially minimize the rate of descent to the extent that is operationally feasible. 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.

NAT Doc. 007 16.6.25 The flight crew can obtain oceanic clearances by GP, VHF, HF, DCPC, or data link. Chapter 5 in this manual can be referenced for complete oceanic clearance requirements. Be aware that for some airports located close to oceanic boundaries oceanic clearances may be obtained before departure. Indeed on the east side of the NAT this will apply to departures from all Irish airfields, all UK airfields west of 2 degrees 30 minutes West and all French Airfields west of 0 degrees longitude. Flights leaving airports in Iceland, Faeroes, or Greenland will receive oceanic clearances prior to departure. Therefore, the correct answer is \"All airports in Iceland.\".",

The effect of these flows is to concentrate most of the traffic uni-directionally, with peak westbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 1130 UTC and 1900 UTC and peak eastbound traffic crossing the 30W longitude between 0100 UTC and 0800 UTC. 2.1.2 The flight levels normally associated with the OTS are FL310 to FL400 inclusive. These flight levels, and their use have been negotiated and agreed by the NATS ATS providers and are published as the Flight Level Allocation Scheme (FLAS). (See Attachment 5). The FLAS also determines flight levels available for traffic routing partly or wholly outside of the OTS as well as flights operating outside of the valid time periods of the OTS; often referred to as “transition times’. 2.1.3 The hours of validity of the two Organised Track Systems (OTS) are as follows: (Westbound) Day-time OTS 1130 UTC to 1900 UTC at 30°W (Eastbound) Night-time OTS 0100 UTC to 0800 UTC at 30°W",

Flight crews intending to fly on a random route or outside the OTS time periods may plan any flight level(s) in accordance with the NAT FLAS. Note: The FLAS is published in the UK and Canadian AIPs and described in Attachment 5. 4.1.11 Flights which are planned to follow an OTS track for its entire length (during the OTS periods) may plan any of the levels published for that track, keeping in mind PBCS and DLM requirements. Note: PBCS tracks will be identified in Note 3 of the OTS message. Operators planning to operate in the altitude band FL350-390 on the PBCS OTS are subject to equipage and authorization requirements as outlined in NAT OPS Bulletin, “Implementation of Performance Based Separation Minima”. 4.1.12 Operators may include climbs in the flight plan, although each change of level during flight must be requested from ATC by the flight crew. Approval of such requests will be entirely dependent upon potential traffic conflicts. ATC may not always be able to accommodate requested flight level changes and prudent pre-flight fuel planning should take this into consideration",

The pilot now counter signs the maintenance release to accept the aircraft back into service. In this question, 'the engineer leaves for a minute or two'. The engineer will inspect the work when it is complete and then sign the maintenance release to confirm all was done correctly. This allows the pilot to counter sign the paperwork and so accept the aircraft back into service. Looking at the other answers: 'The Commander should ask the engineer to explain how he / she can sign the maintenance release when he / she was NOT involved in the work, nor did he / she watch it being carried out' --> INCORRECT as the engineer does NOT need to do the work, only inspect it on completion. The work could be done by another engineer or a technician. 'The Commander must ask the engineer to get the technician who completed the work to sign a maintenance release' --> INCORRECT. Technicians are NOT qualified to sign the maintenance release. They can carry out the work but only the engineer can sign this document. 'The Commander should reject the aircraft and ask for an independent check by another aircraft engineer' --> INCORRECT. Another engineer is NOT needed, the current engineer is qualified to check and certify the work that has been done.

It is not sufficient to rely on oral contact between pilots and engineers when the aircraft arrives. Every malfunction, unreliable operation or damage including bird strikes observed by the crew must be reported in written and so does any work performed by the technicians, should it be repair or regular maintenance.

If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1)aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2)the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3)the direction to an alternate airport; 4)any strategic lateral offset being flown and, 5)terrain clearance 13.3 ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ONCE OFFSET FROM TRACK If possible maintain the assigned flight level until established on the 9.3 km (5.0 NM) parallel, same direction track or route offset. If unable, initially minimize the rate of descent to the extent that is operationally feasible. 13.3.2 Once established on a parallel, same direction track or route offset by 9.3 km (5.0 NM), either: a) descend below FL 290, and establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset from those flight levels normally used, then proceed as required by the operational situation or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance; or b) establish a 150 m (500 ft) vertical offset (or 300 m (1000 ft) vertical offset if above FL 410) from those flight levels normally used, and proceed as required by the operational situation, or if an ATC clearance has been obtained, proceed in accordance with the clearance.

HORIZONTAL COMPONENT The horizontal component (H) of the earth’s field is known as the directive force and it is the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian (providing a directional reference). Near the magnetic poles, the vertical component becomes much greater than at lower latitudes where the horizontal component dominates. This leads to needles or cards in compasses being pulled downwards towards the ground, getting caught or dragging instead of turning freely in the horizontal plane. The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component.",

FTL.205(e) ‘Maximum daily FDP with the use of extensions due to in-flight rest’ This question is poorly worded, as it fails to specify whether the flight crew is augmented or not. However, it can be inferred from the option \"Depending on the crew rest facilities available\" that an augmented crew is available, so inflight rest may be used. This is the only plausible explanation for this question. The other options are incorrect. While the commander has the authority to decide on duty extension or rest shortening, this only applies in the case of unforeseen circumstances. At home base or company hubs, standby or reserve crew members should be available to avoid the exercise of the commander's discretion. The operator may decide to extend the FDP, but it must be planned in advance, which is not the case here. Regardless, it appears that this question is missing critical information, which may affect its accuracy. As a result, we suggest disputing this question if you encounter it during your official exam. EASA AIR OPS - ORO.

(This should be part of the VAPP/VREF safety margin, so we would not usually change the speed, but this answer is much more correct than reducing speed.) On wet/flooded or slush covered runways the tire may hydroplane which reduces the braking forces between the tire and runway significantly. Therefore, in such conditions, a positive (firm, not hard) landing is required to break through the layers of water on the runway, thus minimising the risk of aquaplaning. A \"greaser of a landing\" is most certainly not the answer, because you will only add to the risk of aquaplaning. Furthermore wheel spin-up can be delayed on slippery runways, which affects the proper functioning of the antiskid system and the deployment of ground spoilers. When on the runway, you should apply reverse thrust and lift dumper devices. The lift dumpers are basically ground spoilers that are used to 'dump' lift which, consequently, puts the weight down on the wheels and increases control/braking action.",

Looking at the answers: 'It is a document confirming that the daily check has been completed by a qualified engineer, that the aircraft is free from technical faults, and is released for service' --> INCORRECT. The daily check is noted in the technical log, not the maintenance release. Also, the aircraft is not necessarily free of all defects. There could be other defects being carried under the MEL. 'The maintenance release procedure confirms that the aircraft is prepared and safe for maintenance to be conducted on the airframe and / or on-board systems' --> INCORRECT. The maintenance release confirms completion of the work done, not preparation for the work to be done. 'To confirm that any maintenance work conducted on an aircraft has been completed satisfactorily in accordance with approved data and procedures' --> CORRECT. As discussed above. 'It is a document that is used by the pilots to prepare an aircraft prior to conducting a flight test following a maintenance procedure' --> INCORRECT. Preparing for a flight test is another matter, well outside the scope of these Learning Objectives. ICAO Annex 6 Maintenance release. A document which contains a certification confirming that the maintenance work to which it relates has been completed in a satisfactory manner, either in accordance with the approved data and the procedures described in the maintenance organization’s procedures manual or under an equivalent system.

Detailed instructions should be laid down for dealing with fuel spillage When it refers to the correct earthing procedure, that is just a case of making sure that all of the aircraft and fuel pump components are properly bonded together and all electricaly grounded, to let any static electricity dissipate, before removing fuel caps and beginning the fuelling procedure. Sometimes this bonding procedure is actualy done between aircraft and fuel bowser rather than the ground, if it is on a fuel truck.

More information here for other questions on the crew only: to differentiate between when the crew need to wear both their seat belts AND harnesses and when it is required to use just the seat belt. Seat belt and harness: take-off, landing and whenever the commander decides it is necessary for safety, for example in turbulence. Seat belt only: any other phase of flight while seated at their station. This allows the crew to release the harness straps for comfort when safely away from the ground.

MPA.225 Seats, safety belts and restraint systems (a) Crew members (1) During take-off and landing, and whenever decided by the commander in the interest of safety, each crew member shall be properly secured by all safety belts and restraint systems provided. (2) During other phases of the flight, each flight crew member in the flight crew compartment shall keep the assigned station safety belt fastened while at his/her station. (b) Passengers (1) Before take-off and landing, and during taxiing, and whenever deemed necessary in the interest of safety, the commander shall be satisfied that each passenger on board occupies a seat or berth with his/her safety belt or restraint system properly secured. (2) The operator shall make provisions for multiple occupancy of aircraft seats that is only allowed on specified seats. The commander shall be satisfied that multiple occupancy does not occur other than by one adult and one infant who is properly secured by a supplementary loop belt or other restraint device.",

            "explanation": "ICAO Annex 6 Chapter 1. Definitions Navigation specification. A set of aircraft and flight crew requirements needed to support performance-based navigation operations within a defined airspace. There are two kinds of navigation specifications: Required navigation performance (RNP) specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that includes the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNP, e.g. RNP 4, RNP APCH. Area navigation (RNAV) specification. A navigation specification based on area navigation that does not include the requirement for performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the prefix RNAV, e.g. RNAV 5, RNAV 1. Note 1.— The Performance-based Navigation (PBN) Manual (Doc 9613), Volume II, contains detailed guidance on navigation specifications. Note 2.— The term RNP, previously defined as “a statement of the navigation performance necessary for operation within a defined airspace”, has been removed from this Annex as the concept of RNP has been overtaken by the concept of PBN. The term RNP in this Annex is now solely used in the context of navigation specifications that require performance monitoring and alerting, e.g. RNP 4 refers to the aircraft and operating requirements, including a 4 NM lateral performance with on-board performance monitoring and alerting that are detailed in Doc 9613. Whilst Annex 6 does say the term RNP has been mostly removed, the basic definition of it still stands, but is now more complex in terms of PBN operations, which can be found in ICAO doc. 9613. The other possible answers are also nowhere near correct.",

NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO NAT Doc 007 Chapter 8 Position Plotting 8.2.12 Plotting the aircraft’s progress on a chart can be a useful tool for contingency situations. In the event of a total loss of long range navigation capability, a completed plotting chart will assist in the necessary reversion to dead reckoning. In other contingency situations it can help in assessing separation assurance from other tracks or from high terrain (e.g over Greenland). Chapter 12 Complete Failure of Navigation Systems Computers 12.2.9 A characteristic of the navigation computer system is that the computer element might fail, and thus deprive the aircraft of steering guidance and the indication of position relative to cleared track, but the basic outputs of the IRS (LAT/LONG, Drift and Ground speed) are left unimpaired. A typical drill to minimise the effects of a total navigation computer system failure is suggested below. It requires comprehensive use of the plotting chart. a) use the basic IRS/GPS outputs to adjust heading to maintain mean track and to calculate ETAs. b) draw the cleared route on a chart and extract mean true tracks between way points. c) at intervals of not more than 15 minutes plot position (LAT/LONG) on the chart and adjust heading to regain track.",

            "explanation": "Important Note: This question is from brand new feedback and is currently unverified. We think that the question may come with a specific NAT track message, and identify a specific route, but as yet we cannot be sure. Please let us know if you see this question in the real exam, and anything you can remember from it, so we can get it as accurate as possible, thank you! Performance Based Communications and Surveillance (PBCS) PBCS standards were introduced in the NAT HLA for aircraft that meet the “Required Communication Performance” (RCP) and “Required Surveillance Performance” (RSP) specifications which ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. Performance-based operations and monitoring have been implemented in the NAT HLA to ensure the ongoing safety and efficiency of ATM operations. The performance of FANS equivalent, CPDLC, and ADS-C aircraft are monitored in the NAT HLA against RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications. Separation of PBCS aircraft remains an air traffic control function and responsibility. When an aircraft does not meet RCP 240 and RSP 180 specifications, ATC shall provide standard separation criteria. Aircrew must report any failure or malfunction of GNSS, ADS-C, or CPDLC equipment to ATC as soon as it becomes apparent. For aircraft planning to operate in the NAT HLA, PBCS capabilities, when operational, are reflected in the ICAO flight plan as follows: Item 10a: FANS designator (e.g., J7); FANS CPDLC RCP 240 compliance designator (e.g., P2) Item 10b: FANS ADS-C compliance (D1 or G1 for ATN systems) Item 18: FANS ADS-C RSP 180 compliance (SUR/RSP180); FANS 4 compliance (PBN/L1) As for this question, technically, both RVSM and continuous availability for data-link communication are both correct. However, as all flights within the NAT HLA require RVSM (other than special cases), we are going to say that the continuous data-link is the most correct answer, given the wording of the question.",

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO Doc 007 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADS‐C and ADS‐B transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly self‐ selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when non‐normal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude‐keeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as “Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)”. 8.5.9 This procedure provides for offsets within the following guidelines: a) an aircraft may fly offsets right of centreline up to a maximum of 2 NM; and b) offsets left of centreline are not permitted.",

Looking at the regulation below, we can see that there are some non-specific rules about making sure the aircraft and occupants are safe, given the carriage of PRMs, which would naturally include a limit of how many PRMs can be on board, but this is an operator chosen limit, as long as it is approved by the authority. Therefore, there is no hard and fast limit, but it relatively easy to say that 70% of a 10 passenger helicopter being PRMs would make any evacuation much more difficult, and therefore less safe, with only 3 able-bodied passengers able to assist more than double that amount of PRMs. The highest proportion of PRMs to able-bodied passengers in airline policies we were able to find was 1:1. The other options present are not correct: The \"80%\" rule does not exist. All passengers should always be briefed on how to operate seat belts and the location of life jackets. The overwater element does add some danger, but the same flight over land would be dangerous to perform with so many PRMs also. EASA AIR OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 CAT. OP.

In the NAT HLA (High Level Airspace) any track deviation for weather: Maintain current Flight Level if less than 5 NM of track deviation, or If the deviation from track exceeds 5 NM, then climb or descend 300 ft. An easy memory aid for climbing or descending is S. A. N. D. which is South - Ascend and North - Descend. Looking at the answers: 'Descend as quickly as possible without any lateral deviation' --> INCORRECT. Descending rapidly without any lateral deviation will endanger the aircraft as the NAT tracks are stacked vertically with aircraft. 'Immediately descend to 500 ft away from the level' --> INCORRECT. 500 ft is for contingency scenarios, not for weather avoidance. 'Descend slowly without any lateral deviation' --> INCORRECT. Any descent while still on the NAT track will endanger the aircraft as the NAT tracks are stacked vertically with aircraft. 'Deviate 30º left or right and descend 300 ft away from the assigned level' --> CORRECT. Not a perfect answer, but the only possible correct one here. You must turn off track initially and once 5 NM off track can descend 300 ft if the turn was to the north. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL NAT DOC 007 13.4 DEVIATIONS AROUND SEVERE WEATHER 13.4.6 If the aircraft is required to deviate from track or route to avoid adverse meteorological conditions and prior clearance cannot be obtained, an ATC clearance shall be obtained at the earliest possible time. Until an ATC clearance is received, the pilot shall take the following actions: a) if possible, deviate away from an organized track or route system b) establish communications with and alert nearby aircraft by broadcasting, at suitable intervals: aircraft identification, flight level, position (including ATS route designator or the track code) and intentions, on the frequency in use and on 121.5 MHz (or, as a backup, on the inter-pilot air-to-air frequency 123.450 MHz); c) watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS (if equipped); d) turn on all aircraft exterior lights (commensurate with appropriate operating limitations); e) for deviations of less than 9.3 km (5 NM) from the originally cleared track or route remain at a level assigned by ATC; f) for deviations greater than 9.3 km (5 NM) from the originally cleared track or route, when the aircraft is approximately 9.3 km (5 NM) from track or route, initiate a level change in accordance with Table below. If flying generally Eastbound (i.e. a magnetic track of 000° to 179°) and deviating left (ie north) of track then descend 300 ft; if, however, deviating right (i.e. south) of track then climb 300 ft. If flying generally Westbound (i.e. a magnetic track of 180° to 359°) and deviating left (i.e. south) of track then climb 300 ft; if, however, deviating right (i.e. north) of track then descend 300 ft.

            "explanation": "NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL ICAO Doc 007 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) 8.5.8 While ATC clearances are designed to ensure that separation standards are continually maintained for all traffic, errors do occur. Neither flight crews nor controllers are infallible. Gross Navigation Errors (usually involving whole or half latitude degree mistakes in route waypoints) are made, and aircraft are sometimes flown at flight levels other than those expected by the controller. Ironically, when such errors are made, the extreme accuracies of modern navigation and height keeping systems themselves increase the risk of a collision. Within an ATS Surveillance environment where VHF communications are available, controllers alerted to such errors will intervene using VHF voice communications. In areas (surveillance or otherwise) where VHF voice communication is not available, controllers rely on voice and data link position reports augmented by ADS‐C and ADS‐B transmissions to monitor conformance. Controllers, when alerted to errors, will intervene using HF, CPDLC, SATVOICE or any other means available. Given the potential delay in intervention, it has been determined that encouraging aircraft operating in the NAT to fly self‐ selected lateral offsets provides an additional safety margin and mitigates the risk of traffic conflict when non‐normal events (such as aircraft navigation errors, height deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude‐keeping errors) do occur. Collision risk is significantly reduced by application of these offsets. These procedures are known as “Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP)”. 8.5.9 This procedure provides for offsets within the following guidelines: a) an aircraft may fly offsets right of centreline up to a maximum of 2 NM; and b) offsets left of centreline are not permitted.",

Accountable Manager: Holds ultimate responsibility and authority for the safety and compliance of the operator. Safety Manager: Manages the day to day operation and effectiveness of the operator's Safety Management System (SMS). Here we are asked who would be responsible for the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programme. This is describing the safety manager. The safety manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SMS safety management system, which includes FDM. For a smaller operator (Non complex) this is typically the accountable manager or a line Captain. Both of these positions offer sufficient relevant experience in operational roles to be an effective safety manager. For a larger operator (Complex) this position would now need a more dedicated specialist due to the size or type of operation. Now the operator will need a safety manager and safety review board AMC1 ORO.

This training should be provided at the time of operator conversion training and thereafter at intervals not exceeding three years. The content and duration of the training should be adapted to the security threats of the individual operator and should ensure that crew members act in the most appropriate manner to minimise the consequences of acts of unlawful interference. This programme should include the following elements: (a) determination of the seriousness of the occurrence; (b) crew communication and coordination; (c) appropriate self-defence responses; (d) use of non-lethal protective devices assigned to crew members whose use is authorised by the Member State; (e) understanding of behaviour of terrorists so as to facilitate the ability of crew members to cope with hijacker behaviour and passenger responses; (f) in case where cabin crew are required, live situational training exercises regarding various threat conditions; (g) flight crew compartment procedures to protect the aircraft; (h) aircraft search procedures, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 300/2008, including identification of prohibited articles; and (i) guidance on the least risk bomb locations.",

            "explanation": "Looking at the answer options: 'Improve the ability of the flight crew to perform dead reckoning navigation in the event of a loss of on-board navigation systems, in order to continue flight within the NAT HLA' --> INCORRECT. Training for North Atlantic operating procedures will not go into the details of dead reckoning and other fundamental navigation functions. Besides, 2 Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNS) are required for unrestricted access to the HLA. 'Familiarise the flight crew with the limitations of the long-range VHF communications systems used within the NAT HLA, and the deviations from normal VHF phraseology' --> INCORRECT. VHF communications are not considered as being 'long-range'. In the NAT HLA, HF communications are used to liaise with aeradio operators. 'Provide the flight crew with sufficient knowledge of SOPs in order to help them deal with any kind of abnormal situation while operating within the NAT HLA' --> INCORRECT. The problem with this answer is 'any kind of abnormal situation'. Crew will be trained in the most common abnormal situations, but it is unrealistic to cover any kind of the 1000's that could occur. 'Highlight the risks of complacency and lack of adherence of SOPs due to over-reliance on the provision and reliability of modern aeroplane systems' --> CORRECT. This is taken from ICAO Doc 007, as shown below. During long transatlantic flights, crews can become complacent and over rely on the aircraft's navigation and auto-flight systems. By maintaining SOP's the crew will ensure proper monitoring and cross checking during the flight.

Imagine being on one of many NAT parallel tracks, with aircraft stacked 1000 ft apart vertically above and below you. If you need to divert, then doing so safely will require obtaining a degree of separation from surrounding aircraft. In this event: 1. Separate laterally: turn left or right by at least 30o until 5NM off track and then parallel. Minimise descent during this phase. 2. Separate vertically. If you need to descend below NAT HLA, now descend to FL 280. Otherwise, if in RVSM airspace then split levels by 500 ft. Note: An simple way to detect correct and incorrect answers is to remember: Contingency scenarios climb or descent: 500 ft Weather avoidance climb or descent: 300 ft NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 13 13.2 GENERAL PROCEDURES 13.2.1 If an aircraft is unable to continue the flight in accordance with its ATC clearance, a revised clearance shall be obtained, whenever possible, prior to initiating any action. If prior clearance cannot be obtained, the following contingency procedures should be employed until a revised clearance is received: a) leave the cleared route or track by initially turning at least 30 degrees to the right or to the left, in order to intercept and maintain a parallel, same direction track or route offset 9.3 km (5.0 NM). The direction of the turn should be based on one or more of the following: 1) aircraft position relative to any organized track or route system, 2) the direction of flights and flight levels allocated on adjacent tracks, 3) the direction to an alternate airport; 4) any strategic lateral offset being flown, and 5) terrain clearance;",

This is confirmed at the top of the display, where you can see differing positions for FMS 1 and FMS 2. It appears that one of the two FMS has failed, causing this disagreement. For unrestricted access in the NAT HLA, the aircraft must have at least two fully serviceable Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNSs). This can be: GNSS INS (INS has its own stand alone computer) IRS / FMC. (IRS sends its readings to the FMC to process) The flight crew should, therefore, investigate the faulty system and assess whether it is possible to continue the flight with reduced redundancy. ATC should be informed. Looking at the answers: 'Revert to dead reckoning navigation starting at the last plotted position since all navigation systems have failed and show incorrect information' --> INCORRECT. Not all navigation systems have failed. 'Identify and isolate the faulty system and establish whether it is possible to continue the flight as originally planned but with reduced redundancy' --> CORRECT. As discussed above. 'Notify ATC of the total navigation system failure and continue the flight while monitoring the performance of the faulty FMS in backup mode' --> INCORRECT. It is not a total navigation failure. 'Immediately descend to exit the NAT HLA since the navigation accuracy is uncertain and separation to adjacent traffic CANNOT be assured' --> INCORRECT. With one remaining FMS, the crew must inform ATC. Depending on the prevailing traffic conditions, ATC will decide on the best course of action. Besides, an immediate descent would be dangerous as there are many aircraft stacked vertically on NAT routes. Normally a descent is preceded by an offset of 5 NM. NORTH ATLANTIC OPERATIONS AND AIRSPACE MANUAL — CHAPTER 12 One System Fails After the OCA Boundary is Crossed 12.2.5 Once the aircraft has entered oceanic airspace, the flight crew should normally continue to operate the aircraft in accordance with the oceanic clearance already received, appreciating that the reliability of the total navigation system has been significantly reduced. 12.2.6 The flight crew should however, a) assess the prevailing circumstances (e.g. performance of the remaining system, remaining portion of the flight in the NAT HLA, etc.); b) prepare a proposal to ATC with respect to the prevailing circumstances (e.g. request clearance above or below the NAT HLA, turn-back, obtain clearance to fly along one of the special routes, etc.); c) advise and consult with ATC as to the most suitable action; d) obtain appropriate re-clearance prior to any deviation from the last acknowledged oceanic clearance.",

It should be recognised that these routes are within the NAT HLA, and that State approval must be obtained prior to flying along them. These routes are also available for interim use by aircraft normally approved for unrestricted NAT HLA operations that have suffered a partial loss of navigation capability and have only a single remaining functional LRNS. Detailed descriptions of the special routes known as ‘Blue Spruce Routes’ are included in Chapter 3 of this Document. Other routes also exist within the NAT HLA that may be flown by aircraft equipped with only a single functioning LRNS. These include routings between the Azores and the Portuguese mainland and/or the Madeira Archipelago and also routes between Northern Europe and Spain/Canaries/Lisbon FIR to the east of longitude 009° 01' W (viz. T9). Other routes available for single LRNS use are also established in the NAT HLA, including a route between Iceland and the east coast of Greenland and two routes between Kook Islands on the west coast of Greenland and Canada.

Operators should therefore devise procedures which will reduce this risk, as well as ensuring that the subject is covered during training.

However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

            "explanation": "This airport gives us 2 different approaches: A precision approach: ILS CAT I (DH: 240 feet, RVR/Visibility: 550 metres) A non-precision approach: LOC DME (MDH: 420 feet, RVR/Visibility: 1200 metres) In the event of a diversion to this airport, which approach would you plan to use? The ILS CAT I is a precision approach and so has lower minima, giving us a better chance to land successfully. Let's plan on using that. Using the planning requirements for an ETOPS en-route alternate, we need to add a factor to the minima. The idea is to degrade the equipment performance, but ensure the weather conditions will still allow for a successful approach in the time window. This way, when we actually arrive at the airport, the real minima will be met, even with inaccuracy in the weather forecasts. As calculated here: DH + 200 ft (240 ft + 200 ft = 440 ft) RVR / Visibility + 800 m (550 m + 800 m = 1350 m) So, check the forecast to ensure that the cloud ceiling is at or above 440 ft and check the RVR is forecast at or above 1350m during the relevant time window. On arrival, you will use a DH of 240 ft with an RVR of 550 m.",

The horizontal component approaches zero over the poles => With a horizontal component which is too weak, compass performance becomes sluggish and inaccurate. The value of the horizontal component is maximum at the Magnetic Equator, a freely suspended compass needle in the Earth's magnetic field will be horizontal to the Earth - in line with the horizontal component. Note: This question is now out of the scope of subject 071 and it has been moved to 022. However, it has been recently reported under Operational Procedures (071).",

Such an operator will have their own staff, acting under their approval. However, an operator may need to use another company to carry out work on their behalf (a contractor). For example, consider an airline who do not have their own staff at a remote base and so they may use a handling agent. We have 2 situations to consider in these questions: 1. The contractor DOES NOT hold their own approval (from an authority). No problem, they can still carry out the task, but under the operator's approval. 2. The contractor DOES hold their own approval. Now the contractor can carry out the work under their own approval. But the operator must check that the contractor is doing things properly by checking for compliance monitoring, risk management, holds the correct approvals etc. In either case, a written agreement is required between the operator and the contractor. A verbal agreement is insufficient and can't be verified by the authority. More information from the source material below. EASA AIR OPS ORO.

Drunken behaviour at check-in, at the gate, in sales offices, in lounges or on board the aircraft is in conflict with the goal to be a safe and secure airline and lowers the category of customer satisfaction experienced by other passengers. It also places additional and often unacceptable burdens on crew members and ground staff. Therefore, it's the operator's responsibility not to let drunk passengers board the aircraft if they are disruptive or aggressive and fail to show due consideration to other passengers and/or cabin personnel. The gate personnel or supervisor, senior cabin crew member will ask the passenger to comply with the rules. If possible, take the passenger aside before asking him/her to respect the rules. If the passenger repeatedly refuses to comply with the rules, the commander may use his/her authority to offload the passenger. Cabin crew are usually the ones who recognize whether a passenger is unfit to fly because of alcohol and inform the captain of the matter. Generally speaking, unless the senior cabin crew or the commander is unhappy to have the passenger on board, the commander might allow the intoxicated passenger to board the aircraft, under certain conditions, such as no more alcohol served, etc.",

However, it must be appreciated that any such automated MET Reports do not include information on any observations of special or non-routine significant meteorological phenomena, such as moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash, thunderstorms, etc. Therefore, any flight crew providing position reports via data link, who encounters any such significant meteorological phenomena should report this information via voice or, if appropriate, via a CPDLC free text downlink message.

It is recommended that pilots should request their Oceanic Clearance at least 40 minutes prior to the Oceanic entry point ETA except when entering the Reykjavik area from the Scottish or Stavanger areas, then the clearance should be requested 20 minutes before the Oceanic entry point ETA. 5.1.5 At some airports situated close to oceanic boundaries or within the NAT Region, it may be necessary to obtain the Oceanic Clearance before departure. These procedures are detailed in relevant State AIPs, which should be consulted prior to departure. On the east side of the NAT, this will apply to departures from all Irish airfields, all UK airfields west of 2° 30'W and all French Airfields west of zero degree longitude.

Since this horizontal component becomes very weak near the magnetic poles, magnetic compasses are highly unreliable near the poles. Within these areas, air navigation tasks are further complicated by very rapid changes in magnetic variation over small distances. For example, when flying between the magnetic North Pole and the true North Pole, a heading of true North results in a magnetic heading of South (a magnetic variation of 180 degrees). The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate system is such that all meridians converge to the pole. This convergence also presents additional directional complications. When flying a great circle courses at latitudes greater than 67 degrees, convergence of the meridians can create rapid changes in true headings and true courses with small changes in aircraft position. As a result, relatively small errors in determining the aircraft's actual position can produce very large errors in determining the proper heading to fly and maintain the assigned flight path. When even small errors occur, very large navigation errors can develop over extremely short distances. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course can change several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantly altering the aircraft’s magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course.",

If you see this question in your exam, then please let us know, either in the comments, or emailed to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. Looking at the answers: 'Once the passenger is on board, it is the Commander’s decision whether he/she travels, so the Commander should decide alone whether to offload him/her' --> INCORRECT. According to ICAO Annex 6, the commander has full authority once the doors are closed. Also, the wording \"the commander should decide alone\" is problematic as the commander should decide taking into account all relevant inputs such as the dispatcher and SCCM. 'The Commander should tell the passenger that he/she may travel on condition that he/she accepts that NO alcohol will be served on the flight' --> INCORRECT. Too little, too late. According to the question, the passenger is already drunk and therefore could endanger the flight. 'If the SCCM is happy for the passenger to travel, then the Commander should allow him/her to do so' --> INCORRECT. The commander can not ignore the dispatcher with the aircraft still on the ground and parked. The SCCM's input is valuable and to be considered but is not the whole picture. 'If the Dispatcher is requesting to offload the passenger, the Commander should assist in doing this' --> CORRECT. With the aircraft still on stand and the doors open, this is the best option. As mentioned above, feedback indicates this to be the correct option.",

MPA.145(a) Establishment of minimum flight altitudes CONSIDERATIONS FOR ESTABLISHING MINIMUM FLIGHT ALTITUDES (a) The operator should take into account the following factors when establishing minimum flight altitudes: (1) the accuracy with which the position of the aircraft can be determined; (2) the probable inaccuracies in the indications of the altimeters used; (3) the characteristics of the terrain, such as sudden changes in the elevation, along the routes or in the areas where operations are to be conducted; (4) the probability of encountering unfavourable meteorological conditions, such as severe turbulence and descending air currents; and (5) possible inaccuracies in aeronautical charts. (b) The operator should also consider: (1) corrections for temperature and pressure variations from standard values; (2) ATC requirements; and (3) any foreseeable contingencies along the planned route.",
