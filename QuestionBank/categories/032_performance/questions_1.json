            "explanation": "SPECIFIC FUEL CONSUMPTION Specific fuel consumption (SFC) in a jet is the fuel flow per unit of thrust, while SFC for a propeller is the fuel flow per unit of power. It is a measurement of efficiency, lower SFC means less fuel used, so is better. It is also an engine measurement, not to do with the aircraft's aerodynamics. In a turbojet engine, SFC is lowest (which is best) when the air temperature is low, and also when the engine is running at its design RPM of approximately 90 to 95% rpm. This means that SFC is proportional to temperature. It also means that the engine-aircraft combination is most efficient at high altitude where the thrust required to overcome drag is approximately 90 to 95% of the thrust available. This creates an optimum altitude for a turbojet engine where the most efficient engine speed lines up with the most efficient airframe speed. This is an aerodynamic consideration though, and is not actually about the SFC This then gets a little complex, as SFC, (being engine dictated, not aerodynamic) is not actually to do with the pressure of the air (pressure altitude), but actually changes based on the temperature of the air, colder air being more efficient to burn, therefore lower SFC. The problem with this is that the pressure altitude usually dictates the temperature, higher altitude = colder temperatures = lower SFC. This means that we are going to have to discount the answer that states, \"Altitude has NO effect on SFC.\", because it does affect it, just via the changing temperatures. The answer doesn't leave any \"wiggle room\" to argue its case, so we cannot declare it true. Therefore we have to choose the answer stating, \"SFC decreases at higher altitudes and cold ambient temperatures.\", because this effectively goes through our own thought process of working out SFC, higher altitude = colder temperature = lower SFC.

VMP is minimum power to maintain straight and level flight, always less than VMD therefore the speed is unstable.

SFC varies with the ambient conditions. SFC is best at a minimum and one of the factors it is dependent upon include: Temperature. In cold air, at a particular altitude, the RPM may be reduced to provide the power required because: (a) The power available from the engine is greater. (b) The power required to propel the airframe in cold air is less. The colder the temperature, therefore, the lower will be the SFC because the power absorbed (wasted) at the lower temperature is reduced and the thermal efficiency is increased. As temperature increases, the air becomes less dense. Consequently, engine efficiency decreases and SFC increases. If 1º on ISA gives +0.2% fuel flow increase per unit of thrust, 10º will give an increase of 2%.",

However, a Speed faster or slower than VMD will lead to steeper glide angles. Glide angle = CD / CL GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. GLIDING TIME The aircraft's mass varies the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio (higher VMD). If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.

In a jet aircraft, VMD gives us the Best Endurance and Best Angle of Climb (VX). When flaps are put down, this does not affect our induced drag, as our lift value remains the same (equal to our weight). It does increase our parasite drag though, by presenting a larger surface to the airflow, and therefore increases our overall drag. This means that more thrust is required with flaps out, and therefore we will burn fuel faster, as well as flying slower, due to lower VMD speed in a “dirty” configuration.

When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce.

For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. => With flaps down, Rate of Climb should be lower compared to clean configuration.

Effect of configuration on VX The aircraft configuration is a determining factor that influences the maximum climb angle. In the first image provided, a climb with flaps (or gear) extended is illustrated and compared to the clean configuration. The first figure depicts an increase in parasite area which results in a higher parasite drag. Consequently, the total drag curve shifts upwards and to the left. The thrust required also increases, leading to a slower IAS for VX. As the necessary thrust has increased, the excess thrust decreases, which in turn causes a decrease in maximum climb gradient. Ultimately, flaps or gear usage reduces both maximum climb gradient and VX. Therefore, in this case, the retraction of flaps/slats will result in an increase in VX. Effect of configuration on VY The power required curves will undergo a similar shift as the drag curve. The second figure depicts a decrease in the available excess power, which is indicated by the blue double-headed arrows. As you may remember, a decrease in excess power leads to a reduction in the rate of climb. Nonetheless, the critical point to note is that the speed for maximum excess power is no longer the same when the gear and/or flaps are extended. Instead, it becomes lower. As a result, the climb rate and VY are reduced with the gear and/or flaps extended. Therefore, in this case, the retraction of flaps/slats will result in an increase in VY.",

Recent feedback has confirmed the correct option to be VMD. The correct option in the initial feedback was VMO. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in an exam, and any information you have about it, as our feedback may not be complete. Alternatively, feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. There is also a very similar question in POF, but we are not sure of the validity of the limited feedback for that question. In the event of a fuel leak, our main problem as a flight crew is the chance of fuel exhaustion before a safe landing has been made. It is for that reason that we must make our way to the nearest suitable airfield as fast as possible, but by using the least amount of fuel; after all, we do not want to run out of fuel faster than we have to, by using it or by leaking it. It is for this reason that we have to fly at the best range speed, the same as we would when we want to reach a destination whilst using as little fuel as possible. However, this is a different \"best range\" speed. When we are leaking out fuel, our total fuel \"consumption\" changes, and goes from the standard fuel consumption/speed curve (which closely follows the drag curve), to the same curve, just lifted up, as the fuel consumption has been increased across the board by whatever rate the fuel is leaking at. Of course, the leak could be variable with speed or pressure, etc. but this is the general idea of it, and we should not have to delve as far as those factors. The best range of an aircraft is the point at which the fuel consumption is lowest for the highest speed, and this is shown on the graph by the point where a line from the origin first touches the curve. As you can see in the annex above, the best range speed is higher for the curve with the fuel leak. This is because the fuel is also leaking from the tank, and the faster we go, the less we allow to leak from the tank overall, so the more we have available to burn. This finds an equilibrium with how much drag we are willing to accept by flying faster, and therefore burning fuel at a higher rate. The faster the fuel leak, the higher this optimal speed becomes, starting at the normal \"Best Range\" speed for a very small/no leak, and increasing to VMO for incredibly fast fuel leaks. Further note: We would prefer an answer that mentions something to do with the increased best range speed, or perhaps a speed between best range speed (or LRC) and VMO. Important note: The current feedback is conflicting between exam authorities about which answer is correct. Some say that VMO is correct, and some say VMD is the correct option, please let us know what you get in you exam, and if any appeal process you might decide to take is successful or not.",

Thankfully, we can ignore the extra drag of a failed engine and a larger aircraft, which are not part of the power to weight ratio. Therefore, looking at the options, if the aircraft were at the same gross weight (1250 kg), then the power to weight ratios would be the same.

Please let us know in the comments if you see any version of this question in your real exam, and what you can remember from it, thank you! When aircraft are being certified, the manufacturer must test the aircraft in many different ways to define certain levels of performance for many phases of flight, such as take-off distance, maximum rate of climb, landing distance and many more. There are different types of performance categorisation. Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1.",

To get the maximum of either requires the same principle, just with slightly different criteria. In short, we need more thrust than drag, and the amount of \"excess thrust\" decides how quickly we can climb, as this excess energy has to be converted into gravitational potential. The amount of excess thrust (divided by the mass of the aircraft) decides the angle of climb. The airspeed then decides how quickly we fly up that angle, the rate of climb. Between VX and VY (Best angle and best rate of climb, respectively), the excess thrust (therefore angle of climb) decreases, but the airspeed increases significantly moreso, so we travel up a lower angle, but at a much higher speed, gaining altitude quicker (see annex above). To gain the most \"excess thrust\", which is just thrust minus drag, we should fly at the lowest drag speed (which is an IAS, so does not change with altitude), and produce the most thrust possible. Therefore, to get the best climb performance, we just need to increase thrust. The highest thrust possible from any engine (jet or propeller) is at high air density, so low temperatures and low pressure altitudes.",

A climb gradient of 3% means that for every 100 feet (or 30 meters) of distance traveled, the aircraft will climb 3 feet (or 1 meter). Climb angle, on the other hand, is the angle between the aircraft's flight path and the horizontal plane. It is measured in degrees and is a more intuitive measure of the aircraft's rate of ascent. For example, a climb angle of 15 degrees means that the aircraft is climbing at an angle of 15 degrees relative to the horizon.",

Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required (drag) graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; for increased altitude, the power required curve will look almost the same, but for each point on the curve (which is a certain IAS), the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards). The graph therefore moves upwards and rightwards, away from the origin, so figure 2 is correct.",

A runway is considered damp when the surface is not dry, but when the moisture on it does not give it a shiny appearance. \"Dry runway\". A dry runway is one which is neither wet nor contaminated, and includes those paved runways which have been specially prepared with grooves or porous pavement and maintained to retain \"effectively dry\" braking action even when moisture is present. \"Wet runway.\" A runway is considered wet when the runway surface is covered with water, or equivalent, less than specified in subparagraph (a)(2) above or when there is sufficient moisture on the runway surface to cause it to appear reflective, but without significant areas of standing water.",

As indicated in the comments, more recently, the correct wording of “excess thrust required” has been seen instead. Please do report back if it is worded differently in the exam, thanks! In the descent, assuming that the aircraft is maintaining it's speed (and not accelerating), the aircraft's drag must be higher than its forward engine thrust. Therefore, in the forward thrust terms, there is only \"negative excess thrust\", or “excess thrust required”, or “excess drag”. The excess drag (excess thrust required) is therefore equal to Drag minus Thrust, and this excess drag will have to be equaled by the proportion of weight acting in the direction of travel for a steady descent.",

            "explanation": "Either of the \"Aquaplanning\" or \"Hydroplanning\" terms can be used to refer to a condition where the tyre's tread is unable to clear all the surface water from under the wheel. Water is then pushed ahead of the tyre and forms a wedge that lifts the tyre off the runway. This results in a loss of braking and directional control. The tyre can become scalded and blister, as friction causes the water to heat up and eventually boil, as it is pushed along the runway. There are three forms of hydroplanning that should be considered for Contaminated Runway Operations: Dynamic Hydroplanning Viscous Hydroplanning Reverted Rubber Hydroplanning The point at which the aircraft starts to plane is called the Dynamic Hydroplanning speed. This can be approximated from one of the two formulae below: Hydroplanning speed (kt) = 9 x square root(P/ρ), for a rotating tyre (take-off) Hydroplanning speed (kt) = 7.7 x square root(P/ρ), for a non-rotating tyre (landing), where P is the tyre pressure in PSI and ρ is the Specific Gravity (SG) of the contaminant. If the contaminant is water, where SG=1, then the speed might be described as the Dynamic Aquaplanning Speed and the formula given just as: 9 x square root of the tyre pressure in PSI or 7.7 x square root of the tyre pressure in PSI. A thin film or fluid on a smooth runway surface prevents the tyre from making contact with the runway. Viscous Hydroplanning can occur at much lower speeds than dynamic hydroplanning and is most likely on a smooth, dirty surface. Runway touchdown areas are likely to provide these conditions. Reverted Rubber Hydroplanning occurs after a skid, often on the nosewheel which has neither braking nor anti-skid protection. The high temperature created by friction, boil a thin layer of water and vaporised rubber to steam to support the tyre. This is likely if the nosewheel steering is used indiscriminately on a slippery runway. If the take-off is rejected the contaminant which resisted acceleration now becomes as slippery as sin and braking action is drastically reduced.",

Power is the rate of doing work, and is the amount of thrust x True Air Speed. As thrust required = drag, we can say Power Required = Drag x TAS. Also, the maximum endurance speed for a propeller aircraft is the speed at which it is producing the least engine power, minimum power speed (VMP). In propeller aeroplanes we tend to fly at a constant IAS/CAS and accept the TAS that results, as this allows us to have a constant stall speed (and other speeds) at any altitude. When we maintain our IAS and fly higher, we get a higher TAS to account for the lower air density, and still give us the same lift force. This means that at higher altitude, the TAS increases, so therefore the power required increases as well. As Power Required is based on TAS, it means we also measure the speed for minimum power (VMP) in terms of TAS as well, which increases with altitude, so therefore VMP (which is Maximum Endurance speed) increases.",

For a jet aircraft, this occurs at high altitudes, where the jet engines are running at approximately 90% RPM, and the thrust produced allows the aircraft to fly at its best range speed (IAS), for best speed to drag ratio. It is usually quite close to an aircraft's maximum altitude (for a jet), and above or below it will be a less efficient altitude. If the aircraft is below its optimum altitude, then the engines will be running at a lower RPM to produce the same speed due to the higher air density, which is less efficient, or the aircraft will fly faster for the same engine RPM, which causes higher drag, and is less efficient. If the aircraft is above its optimum altitude, then the engines will be running at a higher RPM (closer to 100%), which reduces efficiency again, increasing fuel burn and engine wear. This question tells us by how much our fuel burn is affected when off altitude, and you simply multiply the percentage by how many 1000's of feet different from the optimum altitude the aircraft is, and the change is always a reduction in specific range.

            "explanation": "CG position VS Aircraft’s performance A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. FORWARD CG increases the pitch down moment tendency of the aircraft. Therefore, greater horizontal stabilizer and elevator deflections are needed to give the aircraft a pitch-up attitude to compensate for the pitch-down moment. Extra lift is generated by increasing the angle of attack, which in turn increases induced drag. Thus performance decreases. For take-off, if the CG position is too far forward, the aircraft is said to have a “heavy nose”. Conversely, as the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since Climb gradient is a product of excess of thrust over drag, climb performance will be improved. For take-off, if the CG position is too far aft, the aircraft is said to have a “light nose” making the rotation easier. Additionally, an aircraft which requires less lift will have a slower rotation speed, which results in a reduced take-off distance. To simplify this concept and make it easier to answer these type of question you can think of a forward CG as having the same effects as a heavy aircraft; and an aft CG as having the same result as a light aircraft.",

            "explanation": "When aircraft are being certified, the manufacturer must test the aircraft in many different ways to define certain levels of performance for many phases of flight, such as take-off distance, maximum rate of climb, landing distance and many more. There are different types of performance categorisation: Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1. So now we know that the gross climb gradient does NOT include a safety margin, which removes two possible answers. It then depends on how you interpret the two other answers, and whether the \"actual\" or \"calculated\" climb gradients can be said to contain a safety margin or not. \"Actual climb gradient\" can be argued either way in our opinion, it could contain a safety margin by the fact that the aircraft achieving a certain gradient needs no further safety reduction (is already corrected from the performance figures by real life performance), or you could say that no further reduction to that gradient is required, so no safety margin is included. \"Calculated climb gradient\", on the other hand, could mean either gross or net climb gradient, as they are both calculated. One with a safety margin, the other is without. Option D says that the 3 terms are the same, which is certainly NOT true as \"gross\" and \"actual\" are not usually the same, so that leaves us with only one option remaining, and it assumes that \"calculated\" means \"net\", and that \"actual climb gradient\" includes a safety margin. NOTE: Having only received one count of feedback for this question, we cannot confirm that this will be exactly replicated in your real exam, so please do let us know in the comments if you see this question, and whatever you might be able to remember from it, thank you!",

For a jet engine this occurs when ambient temperature is very low and engine rpm is very high. This can only occur at high altitude. So, flying at high altitude, minimizes the fuel used per unit of thrust. In level flight the forward acting force of thrust is controlled and balanced by the rearward acting force of drag. If drag is small, the aeroplane need fly with only a small amount of thrust. Therefore, on the formula above, “Total Thrust” can be replaced by “Total Drag”. To minimize drag, the jet aeroplane simply flies at the velocity for minimum drag. In summary then, for a jet aeroplane to maximize its endurance by minimizing its fuel flow, the pilot would fly the aeroplane at VMD and fly as high as possible.",

Power = Thrust x Speed (TAS) Power required = Thrust Required x Speed (TAS) Thrust produced by an engine decreases with altitude because of decreasing air density, which does not allow the engine to burn as much fuel, and create as big explosions. Similarly, power available will decrease with increasing altitude. However, power required rises with increasing altitude. This is because the aircraft flying at constant lift resulting from constant Indicated Airspeed and angle of attack will essentially fly at a higher True Airspeed at a higher altitude because the loss of air density must be compensated for by an increased speed of flight to maintain the required dynamic pressure on the wings. It is important to note for this next section that the shape of the thrust required / available graphs are based on IAS initially, but are converted to TAS to be more useful with Power Required / Power Available, which are created from the thrust graphs using TAS via the formulas above. In this question, then, we are descending, so we are expecting our Power Required to decrease, and our TAS for each point on the graph to decrease also, so the Power Required vs. TAS graph will move down and to the left. Also, the Power Available will increase as we descend into denser air, and the TAS will also decrease for every point on the graph, the same as before, to make the Power Available vs TAS graph move up and to the left.

In most cases the published aeroplane performance data gives take-off and landing distance assuming a level runway. In the case of a sloping runway the effect of gravity will be to shorten the take-off run required (TORR) and the take-off distance required (TODR) when the slope is downhill. An uphill slope will provide the opposite effect, increasing TORR and TODR. In the case of landing a downhill sloping runway will extend the landing distance required (LDR), whereas an uphill slope will decrease it. Consequently, it may be necessary to reduce the aircraft weight for an uphill take-off or a downhill landing. It should also be borne in mind that, as with the landing case, an abandoned take-off will require a greater stopping distance on a down- sloping runway.",

During climb with a steady speed, the thrust and the two retarding effects of aerodynamic drag and the weight element must be equal: T = D + W x Sin Climb angle. Solving for Sin Climb angle, we get: Sin Climb angle = (T - D) / W. If we recognise that for small angles the Sine in the climb equals to the Tangent and that Tangent in turn is the amount of height gained per unit of distance, we get an approximate formula for the Climb Gradient: %Climb Gradient = (T - D) x 100 / W.

            "explanation": "When an aircraft has excess performance during takeoff, using maximum thrust is unnecessary and choosing a lower thrust setting offers benefits in engine life and costs. Two procedures exist: flex takeoff and derated thrust takeoff. The flex take-off is achieved by calculating an assumed or flex temperature that is higher than the ambient which will, when entered into the FMS, give a thrust setting lower than full thrust. The flex temperature will always be higher than the ambient temperature. On a flex take-off the reduced thrust setting for take-off will not need to be increased if there is an engine failure but, in emergency, it can be. Full thrust may be applied at any time. According to AMC 25-13: \"When operating with reduced (flex) take-off thrust, the thrust setting parameter, which establishes thrust for take-off, is not considered a take-off operating limit\". Because full thrust can be applied at any time on a flex take-off, the speeds VMCG and VMCA must be corrected for full thrust, not the reduced thrust setting. A flex take-off is not considered to be a normal take-off, is always at the discretion of the pilot and is not authorised on wet runways, unless suitable performance accountability is made for the increased stopping distance on a wet runway. As most operators account for this, we can assume that flex thrust take-offs are allowed on a wet runway, but not on a contaminated runway. Throughout the flex take-off, a further thrust selection of the Take-off/Go Around (TOGA) is availablle. AMC 25-13 defines derated thrust as a take-off thrust less than the maximum take-off thrust, for which exists in the AFM a set of separate and independent, or clearly distinguishable, take-off limitations and performance data that complies with all the take-off requirements of CS-25. When operating with a derated take-off thrust, the value of the thrust setting parameter, which establishes thrust for take-off, is presented in the AFM and is considered a normal take-off operating limit. A derated thrust take-off is considered to be a normal take-off and therefore can be carried out both on dry runwaysand on wet and contaminated runways, subject to the AFM data and other operating restrictions. Because the take-off speeds are calculated at the lower thrust, the derated thrust setting is considered to be a limit and therefore full thrust or TOGA thrust cannot be selected, even in an emergency, until the hazard area for VMCG is well passed. Airbus, for instance, does not allow TOGA to be selected on a derated take-off, until the aircraft has achieved the minimum flap retraction speed.",

When turning from base onto final approach, the shifting wind will cause a change in the groundspeed first. As the same IAS is being flown, going from a crosswind to a headwind, the groundspeed is lower on final than it was on base. As approaches require a constant angle of descent, therefore, the aircraft will have to change it's rate of descent to maintain the same approach angle (usually 3º). If the aircraft did not change rate of descent, it will descend at the same amount of feet per minute, but take longer than expected to reach the Runway, so would get low on profile. The rate of descent on an approach is directly proportional to the groundspeed (for a 3º glidepath, the rate of descent [ft/min] is the GS [kt] x 5), and therefore a reduction in groundspeed requires a reduction in the rate of descent (the pilot must decrease the vertical speed). Note that the flaps are not required to modify the rate of descent here. The flaps are used to allow us to fly slower during the descent, approach and landing, and increase drag which can be useful to help us descend, but in this scenario, there is no change to IAS or need for greater drag, so the flap setting does not need to change on this final turn, and if it did, the flaps would cause a change to the aircraft's behaviour (a balloon effect), but would not require a change to the A/T settings.",

SPECIFIC RANGE Specific Range (SR) is one of the measures of efficiency for an aircraft, as it is the distance the aircraft can fly per unit of fuel used (higher is better). The easiest formula for it is: Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow The optimum speed for maximum SR is when the TAS is the highest for the lowest fuel flow. As a general rule, the fuel flow of an engine is approximately proportional to the power. Therefore, the SR is highest when TAS is highest for the least power required. This point occurs at VMD for a propeller aircraft, as seen on the graph in the first annex above. As the aircraft becomes lighter, less lift is required to overcome the weight, so the lift induced drag section of the drag curve reduces. This brings the total drag curve down and to the left of the graph, so there is less drag overall (higher SR) and the point of highest SR (VMD) occurs at a slightly lower speed. The graph is usually IAS vs power required, but in this comparison it is fine to use TAS. Also, the graph looks very similar for a jet aircraft, but uses 1.32 x VMD for the point of highest SR. The second annex above shows how weight affects an aircraft's drag (and power required) curve.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is very poorly written. When both engines rotate \"outwards\", both engines have a worse effect in the event of an engine failure than if they rotated \"inwards\". This does not, however, mean they are both critical. A critical engine is one which has a worse effect than the other in the event of an engine failure, so both engines cannot be critical. Nonetheless, we have chosen the option that \"both engines are critical\" as they both have the worst case thrust asymmetry if an engine fails, and the other options were not correct at all. The critical engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing propeller-driven aircraft is the one whose failure would result in the most adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance. When one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust asymmetry exists. The thrust asymmetry can be different, depending on how the engine is mounted. Particularly on a propeller aircraft, the propellers are subject to the asymmetric blade effect, called P-factor. This occurs because the propeller does not spin perpendicular to the airflow, as the aircraft is flying with an angle of attack. This means that the down-going blades on the propeller have a higher angle of attack and longer track, so they produce more thrust. Therefore, the thrust vector of the engine is located not centrally, but more towards the down-going blade side. The annex above shows an aircraft with both engine rotating to the right. This means that one engine has its thrust vector further from the aircraft's longitudinal axis, and therefore if the other engine fails, it has a worse effect on yaw. This engine (with the worst effect on yaw) is called the critical engine. In the case of this question though, both engines have their thrust vector further from the longitudinal axis, so the aircraft has a worse response from either engine failing. In this question, none of the engines have a P-factor closest to the cockpit. That option is not quite correct in its current form.",

As gas turbine engines give their best Specific Fuel Consumption at altitude, it is necessary to climb to an altitude where the engine is most efficient and to be flying at VMD, the best range speed. This then, will be the optimum altitude for range flying. The best range and maximum endurance are achieved at the Optimum Altitude. Operating at \"off-optimum\" altitude, incurs both fuel and mileage penalty. In other words, any deviation, above or below, from the optimum altitude will increase fuel consumption and reduce the Specific Range (SR). As an example, you can see also the Table 4.1 in your CAP 697 (Section 4 MRJT1 p.1). The numbers may be different, but is shows a fuel mileage penalty for deviations from optimum altitude. For this question, 1000 ft deviation from the optimum altitude (above or below) incurs an SR reduction by 1.25%, 2000 ft deviation (above or below) an SR reduction by 2 x 1.25% = 2.5% and so on.",

Weight has a very pronounced effect on aircraft performance. If weight is added to an aircraft, it must fly at a higher AOA to maintain a given altitude and speed. This increases the induced drag of the wings, as well as the parasite drag of the aircraft. Increased drag means that additional thrust is needed to overcome it, which in turn means that less reserve thrust is available for climbing. This moves the Total Drag curve up, but also to the right. Thrust Required is increased and VX is a faster IAS. Best Rate of climb speed (VY) is found at the maximum excess of Power – in other words, where the gap between the “Power” available and Power Required curves is the greatest. As weight increases, the power required curve moves up and to the right. As a result, less excess Power is available and, therefore, the rate of climb decreases. However, as you can see, the speed for maximum Excess Power available is higher. Summary: higher Weight => decreased rate of climb => increased VY speed.",

Please let us know if you see this question in your exam, thank you. Engine performance relies very heavily on air density. The higher the density of air, the more air that can be mixed with fuel and burnt, creating more power. Higher density = higher performance. The conditions which cause air density to reduce (lower performance) are: High pressure altitude (low air pressure). High temperature High humidity In other words, hot, high and humid are bad for performance. An increase in humidity will therefore cause a reduction in density. This will reduce the amount of air available for both types of engine to combust, restricting engine power and decreasing derformance by a similar proportion in both engine types. This is different to a temperature increase, which would have a larger effect on a turbine engine, as not only would the air density be lower, but jet engines quickly become temperature limited so they do not go over the maximum TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature), and their thrust output is therefore further reduced by hot temperatures.",

In the climb, this may not be noticeable for a while, and might not be noticed at all if the autopilot was in certain modes, such as those which maintain a constant rate of climb (assuming constant thrust). Whatever happens, as the aircraft continues to climb, the actual airspeed is unknown whilst the indicated airspeed (IAS) is showing a continuous increase. This is particularly dangerous in modes such as level change or flight level change, which maintain a constant airspeed/Mach No. in the climb, as the aircraft would pitch up more and more to try to reduce the \"increasing airspeed\", stalling the aircraft quite quickly. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

There are different types of performance categorisation. Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1.",

Considering SGR with a headwind, the tangent starts to the right of the graph origin by the amount of the wind strength. The example above is for a 100 kt headwind. However, the tangent to the drag curve now occurs at a speed faster than 1.32 VMD, but the speed increment is less than the wind strength. By flying at this slightly faster speed, the SGR is maximum for the given headwind conditions, although still less (worse) than in still air. This occurs because for every minute the aeroplane is in a headwind, the wind is pushing it backward.

Learning Objective 032.04.04.02.01: Describe and explain the factors which affect the en-route net drift-down flight path. We have not been told whether the aircraft is multi-engine or single-engine, but neither is having a good day. In a multi, the procedure is called a drift-down, and is effectively the aircraft losing height as slowly as possible (with the remaining engine(s) running at max continuous thrust), until the aircraft gets low enough to be able to maintain height on the working engine(s). In a single, it is just gliding to the safest place possible. Nonetheless, in both scenarios we want to extend our glide or drift-down range as far as possible. In this case, we would like a tailwind, which can carry us further away from the mountains, and we should fly as close to minimum drag speed as possible. Minimum drag speed (VMD) is the best glide range speed in both a jet and a prop (it doesn't matter what engine they have if it isn't working), and is going to provide a far better glide ratio that going at nearly VMO, which means having a huge amount of drag, and a very steep glide angle.",

The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; for increased altitude, the power required curve will look almost the same, but for each point on the curve (which is a certain IAS), the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards). The graph therefore moves upwards and rightwards, away from the origin, so figure (d) is correct.",

Rate of descent depends on both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path. The attached graph shows that there is greater excess drag at high speed than at low speeds. The shallowest angle of descent is achieved by staying slow. This means, that the slower speed requires a lower rate of descent to maintain the same descent path. V/S AUTOPILOT MODE Vertical Speed is an autopilot flight guidance vertical mode. In this mode, the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMCG) pitch mode guides the aircraft to the target V/S. The corresponding thrust mode is SPEED or MACH. The increase in drag associated with flap deflection requires an increased power setting in order to maintain a given airspeed and attitude, or a steady rate of descent. In conclusion: Using the V/S autopilot mode means that the autopilot is keeping a constant rate of descent. By slowing down, the vertical speed becomes excessive and the pilot must reduce the vertical speed to maintain a constant descent path. After slowing down to the approach speed, the added drag from the configuration will demand more power/thrust from the engines to keep the airspeed constant.",

For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. Thus, we can conclude that the best climb gradient will be achieved using the least amount of flaps.",

However, a Speed faster or slower than VMD will lead to steeper glide angles. Glide angle = CD / CL GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. GLIDING TIME The aircraft's mass varies the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio (higher VMD) => Glide duration will be decreased. If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.

A downslope (for instance, -2%) => results in a V1 reduction; An upslope (for instance, 2%) => results in a V1 increase. Considering the above: When calculating the Accelerated Stop Distance Required, it is assumed that the engines will fail at V1. According to regulation, 2 seconds of pilot reaction are added before the operating engine is set to IDLE thrust and maximum braking applied. The distance required to bring the aircraft to a complete stop will depend (not solely) on the aircraft's speed and mass. Meaning that, at a higher V1 (higher speed from which braking is applied), the stopping distance will be increased (when comparing to a lower V1).

Unfortunately, the question does not mention this. We will assume that they are asking about jet engines, but please do tell us in the comments or by email (info@atplquestions.com) if this is the same if you see it in the exam. It may be worth commenting on this in the exam (if available) or appealing if you get it wrong, as it is misleading. Engine efficiency can be measured by a value called the Specific Fuel Consumption. This value tells us how much fuel the engine burns per unit of thrust produced. As we want low fuel burn for high thrust, the lower the SFC, the better. The calculation for SFC is via the formula: SFC = Fuel Flow/Thrust The way to make the SFC lower (more efficient) is by operating the engine in cold temperatures, and at high RPM. The cold temperatures bit of the answer is therefore very simple. However, the best altitude (low or high) requires another step. Above we mentioned that the engine like to run at high RPM to improve SFC. This is the same at all altitudes, but the problem is that the engines are far too powerful to run high RPM at low altitudes, and would quickly cause most jets to overspeed, or just run at very high drag speeds. Therefore, we want to fly at high altitudes, where the high RPM of the engines produces the correct amount of thrust for us to fly at a reasonable cruising speed, with lower drag, and better range (This also coincides with colder temperatures, which are good for SFC). Technically, this doesn't change the SFC much, but practically, it makes a huge difference to our overall efficiency, and our range.",

If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time.

Consequently, the right hand side of the power curve lifts up and VY decreases ( “If flying at VMC, you should be able to maintain heading and altitude with no more than 5° bank. “ Incorrect. VMC is the calibrated airspeed, at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the aeroplane with that engine still inoperative, and maintain straight flight with an angle of bank not more than 5º. It does not mention anything about maintaining altitude. “VMC increases with altitude” Incorrect. If asymmetric thrust is high, VMC will be high. Asymmetric thrust is higher at low altitudes, therefore VMC would be expected to decrease with altitude. “Service ceiling remains the same” Incorrect. An engine failure will result in loss of thrust from the failed engine. Parasite drag will also increase – from the rudder and the windmilling engine. The total loss of thrust can be as much as 80%, if we account for the extra drag which needs to be opposed. Based on the above, we can immediately exclude one of the options => The Service ceiling will not remain the same, it will reduce.",

SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) There are two types of specific range, specific air range (SAR) and specific ground range (SGR). Specific air range is the distance through the air covered per unit of fuel burnt, while SGR is the ground distance per unit of fuel. The difference is due to wind, in the same way that groundspeed is just true airspeed plus/minus wind. As per the above learning objective, in the exam, and throughout the ATPLs, consider specific range (SR) to be SAR if not otherwise told.

Please inform us if you encounter this question in your 032 Performance exam. The airframe may become contaminated by ice, frost or water either whilst it is in flight or when standing on the ground. HEAVY RAIN Heavy rain has the following effects on aeroplane performance: - The impingement and rapid accumulation of water sufficiently distorts the shape of the upper wing surface and diminishes the total lift by up to 30% of its normal value. - The impact of the rain on an aeroplane in the landing configuration decreases the aircraft’s forward speed. - When operating in such conditions a jet engine is slow to respond to rapid demands for thrust. - The mass of the rain can increase the aircraft mass momentarily. The total effect of these factors for any aeroplane experiencing such weather conditions is to produce a much lower level of performance. The mass increase raises the stalling speed, whilst the reduced lift and increased drag together reduce the forward speed achieved. An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards.",

Because the Mach number is TAS divided by LSS, this means in turn that at altitude, your Mach number is higher for a given CAS, than it is at low level. The result of this is that, as you climb, the maximum speed is controlled at low level by CAS and VMO, and at altitude you reach your limiting Mach number MMO, before you reach VMO and therefore your maximum speed is controlled by MMO. In the descent the reverse is true. Your maximum speed is controlled by MMO first, and then by VMO at lower altitudes. Alternatively, LSS increases during the descent, due to the rising temperature. Therefore, TAS must increase during descent to maintain constant Mach No. IAS is also increasing and will eventually reach its limit. VMO (\"max operating\") is the term for the maximum certified IAS. NOTE: You can also advice the ECTM lines to show that IAS increases with constant Mach.",

            "explanation": "A tailwind in the downwind leg translates into a headwind situation on final (note that you are heading opposite directions). If no correction to thrust are made, and the pilot uses a \"still air\" setting, the headwind reduces the groundspeed and the previously calculated still air rate of descent will cause you to descend below the glideslope. Keep in mind the formula for target rate of descent on a 3° glideslope: ROD = 5 x groundspeed. For example, if IAS on final equals 120 kt, the still air groundspeed on final is 120 kt, and the required rate of descent = 5 x 120 = 600 ft/min. Now, if the pilot experiences a headwind of 20 kt, the IAS will equal 120 kt, the groundspeed will be 100 kt, and consequently the required rate of descent = 5 x 100 = 500 ft/min A rate of descent of 500 ft/min requires more thrust/power applied than a 600 ft/min ROD. Therefore, more thrust is required on final with a headwind. The next step is to understand whether the ground path will increase or descrease. If the pilot makes the thrust and rate of descent correction the distance on final will be the same, delivering you to the touchdown point. We can only imagine that EASA is referring to what would happen if the pilot did not correct thrust and ROD for the headwind. In which case, the 600 ft/min, in the above example, would have you land short and cause you to cover a reduced ground distance.",

Endurance is the time that the aircraft can remain airborne. Maximum Endurance Speed is the airspeed at which the aircraft burns the least possible amount of fuel, the minimum drag is produced and the minimum thrust is required, thus the maximum airborne time (maximum endurance) is gained. For turbojet aeroplanes, this Maximum Endurance Speed is the VMD. The Maximum Endurance Speed for propeller aircraft is the VMP (speed for minimum power required, slightly slower than VMD). Unlike range, endurance is not affected by the wind conditions, since it is only affected by the airspeed selection and amount of usable fuel onboard. Also, the Maximum Endurance Speed, as an airspeed, is unaffected by the wind. Remember that the aircraft has no idea that the wind exists, so when staying airborne for as long as possible, the wind is irrelevant.",

During flight, an aircraft will experience two types of drag: - Parasite Drag (proportional to IAS2, increases with increasing “Parasite Area”: flaps, undercarriage or speed brakes) - Induced Drag (inversely proportional to IAS2, increases with increasing weight). The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the indicated airspeed where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). At speeds below VMD, the Induced Drag is greater than the Parasite Drag. This is known as the \"speed unstable\" region, as any reduction in airspeed causes an increase in drag, consequently slowing the aircraft down further, causing more drag, and so on. The opposite is true for a speed increase in this region, reducing drag and allowing the aircraft to speed up even more. Speeds above VMD are \"speed stable\", as a temporary increase in airspeed causes an increase in drag, which returns the aircraft back to the equilibrium speed. In this \"speed stable\" region, the parasite drag is greater than the induced drag.",

We have not been told whether the aircraft is multi-engine or single-engine, but neither is having a good day. In a multi, the procedure is called a drift-down, and is effectively the aircraft losing height as slowly as possible (with the remaining engine(s) running at max continuous thrust), until the aircraft gets low enough to be able to maintain height on the working engine(s). In a single, it is just gliding to the safest place possible. Nonetheless, in both scenarios we want to extend our glide or drift-down range as far as possible. In this case, we would like a tailwind, which can carry us further away from the mountains, and we should fly as close to minimum drag speed as possible. Minimum drag speed (VMD) is the best glide range speed in both a jet and a prop (it doesn't matter what engine they have if it isn't working), and is going to provide a far better glide ratio that going at VMO, the maximum operating speed, which means having a huge amount of drag, and a very steep glide angle.

To achieve maximum endurance, fly at the minimum power required speed VMP (which is 0.76 VMD). However, because the aeroplane is speed unstable at VMP, a propeller aeroplane normally holds at a speed faster than its best endurance speed. OPTIMUM ALTITUDE FOR RANGE AND ENDURANCE IN A PROPELLER-DRIVEN AEROPLANE The optimum altitude for range and endurance in a propeller-driven aeroplane varies depending on the engine type. Piston-engine aeroplanes generally have low optimum altitudes, while turboprops generally have medium optimum altitudes. This is because the propeller is more efficient at low altitude, but the jet engine is more efficient at high altitude.

            "explanation": "Jet engines are most efficient at about 90% N1, which is their version of RPM, meaning that they are at 90% of their maximum N1. The airframe of an aircraft has a best range speed too. For jet aircraft, it is 1.32 x VMD, where there is the highest indicated airspeed to drag ratio. To get the most efficient jet cruising level, we just have to find the point at which these two values match up, when the engines are running at around 90% N1 and the aircraft is maintaining 1.32VMD. If we ran a modern jet aircraft at 90% N1 near the ground, it would quickly overspeed, as jets are so powerful. Our best range speed at this altitude would be at a low power setting, which is not efficient. Jet engines produce less thrust with higher altitude due to the lower air density, so at the high cruising altitudes of 35 - 42 000 ft is where the engine efficiency peak usually matches up with the best range speed. Flying higher than the optimum altitude does begin to reduce the range though, as the engine is running just above its peak efficiency zone, though even at maximum altitude, most modern jet aircraft are very close to peak efficiency. The extra beauty of this high altitude cruise is the high TAS (True Airspeed), which is much larger than the IAS at high altitudes. Therefore, the best range in a jet increases with altitude up to the optimum altitude, then begins to decrease again.",

            "explanation": "On a night of clear skies with calm or light surface wind, a temperature inversion can form due to surface cooling - which can lead to windshear. Temperature inversion is defined as a condition where the temperature increases with an increase in altitude. Strong inversions are known to happen in desert areas, where the surface will heat up quickly during the day and cool off rapidly at night. Due to the temperature inversion, vertical mixing is inhibited - meaning that below an inversion, the wind speed will be light, and the wind just above the inversion may be relatively strong => wind shear develops between the calm winds below and the stronger winds above. This wind shear can cause airspeed fluctuations as an aircraft climbs or descends through the inversion. - Depending on the direction that the pilot decides to take off, the wind shift, at the top of the inversion, may change the headwind into a tailwind => which causes IAS to decrease - leading to a decrease in Rate of Climb. The fluctuation in airspeed could also induce a stall precariously close to the ground. - Furthermore, all performance is based on density altitude and temperature is a key factor. The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude, the thinner the air and the less performance from your engines (and wings, etc). Since, as we climb through an inversion, temperature increases with an increase in height => we will experience a decreases aircrafts performance leading to a decrease in thrust and lift, as we climb into warmer and less dense air - which reduces the aircraft's rate of climb. This question came from slightly broken feedback, but is in line with at least two other very similar questions. If the examiner does not mention nighttime, then please look out for the answer with density altitude, as the high daytime temperatures induce a high density altitude (low air density), with the high temperatures being particularly bad for jet engines, which lose a lot of thrust in these conditions.",

That was the easy bit of the question though, and now we have to work out what happens to VY, our best rate of climb speed (now called VYSE as the aircraft is single engine). Theoretically, VYSE will be lower than VY, because the extra drag that is caused by the stopped/windmilling propeller is parasite drag, which increases with the square of speed. This increases the parasite drag in the total drag curve, and therefore moves the whole curve up and to the left (for propeller aircraft we usually use power required/power available graphs but the same thing happens there too). This means that VYSE should be lower that VY, as the tangent point goes to the left, so VY decreases when an engine fails. This is not always the case in practice, as a lot of aircraft use the same speed for both VY and VYSE, whether that is to make it simpler to remember, or to add a little extra safety margin, stopping pilots getting below VYSE with an engine out, which is incredibly dangerous, or just because the drag curve does not change that much. As for statement (2), the VY speed is an indicated air speed (IAS), and remains constant with altitude, so as altitude increases, the TAS of this speed will increase due to the reducing air density.",

For a steady speed to be maintained, the thrust and the two retarding effects of the aerodynamic drag (induced and parasite drag) and the weight element must be equal: T = D + Wsinγ (where γ, the climb angle). Solving for sinγ, we get: sinγ = (T-D)/W, which shows that the climb angle depends on the excess thrust (T-D) and the weight. Thus, the speed for best angle of climb (VX) will be where the excess thrust is greatest. A decrease in mass, decreases the lift induced drag, increasing the excess thrust. Therefore, so as to match the excess thrust and keep it constant, the total drag must be increased by increasing the backward component of weight, which is added to the drag.

As described by the above learning objective, the rate of climb of an aircraft is directly proportional to the power available minus the power required (i.e. the excess power), divided by the weight. We can discuss how this comes about below. As we know, and can prove from first principles using the force diagram above, the angle of climb of the aircraft conforms to the below formula (Ta - Tr) / W = sin (γ) ~= climb gradient Where Ta = Thrust Available, Tr = Thrust Required, W=Weight, γ (Gamma) = Angle of climb. Power = Thrust x velocity, so both Ta and Tr can be multiplied by true airspeed (TAS) to give Pa and Pr (Power Available and Power Required). The rate of climb is the climb gradient multiplied by the velocity, so therefore by multiplying both sides of the equation by velocity, we get the following. (Pa - Pr) / W ~= Rate of climb Therefore, the excess power divided by weight is approximately directly proportional to the rate of climb of the aircraft.",

If the air density reduces, such as at hot or high altitude airfields, the same CAS is actually achieved at a faster TAS. The real speed of the aeroplane at touchdown is faster and the landing distance required is longer. It is worth noting that air density has a greater effect on take-off distance required than on landing distance required. This is because of the need for much higher take-off thrust settings. Low air density reduces the thrust available, which compounds the need to reach a faster TAS for the same calibrated rotate speed. Air density effects engine thrust, therefore decrease on density negative effect on thrust available.",

Since range is maximum when the ratio of TAS to drag is maximum, flying relatively fast but with as little drag as possible is ideal. The above graph shows that although drag is minimum at VMD, the forward speed is only moderate. The ratio of TAS to drag is actually greatest at the tangent to the drag curve, which is at 1.32 times the speed for minimum drag. At this speed, a considerably greater TAS is achieved for only a small increase in drag. Having discovered that a turbojet should be flown at the tangent to the drag curve, which can also be described as 1.32 VMD, the effect of altitude on range must be considered. For endurance to be greatest, L/D must be greatest, which means drag must be minimum. Therefore, to fly for maximum endurance, fly at the minimum drag speed, VMD. Practically, however, it is normal to fly slightly faster than VMD to gain speed stability. Because the drag curve is so shallow at the bottom, flying slightly faster than VMD results in only slightly more drag and, therefore, thrust required and fuel flow. The small reduction in endurance is then operationally offset by the benefits of speed stability. However, turbojet endurance is always maximum at VMD.",

This increases the parasite drag in the total drag curve, and therefore moves the whole curve up and to the left (for propeller aircraft we usually use power required/power available graphs but the same thing happens there too). This means that VYSE should be lower that VY, as the tangent point goes to the left, so VY decreases when an engine fails. This is not always the case in practice, as a lot of aircraft use the same speed for both VY and VYSE, whether that is to make it simpler to remember, or to add a little extra safety margin, stopping pilots getting below VYSE with an engine out, which is incredibly dangerous, or just because the drag curve does not change that much.",

Glide angle (and glide range) itself is independent of aircraft mass - provided the aircraft glides at VMD, since it is the lift over drag (L/D) ratio that determines the gliding range and it is unchanged with mass. As an aircraft only needs to produce enough lift to counteract weight, the best lift to drag ratio therefore comes when drag is lowest (VMD). If the mass increases, so does the lift, as well as the drag (due to induced drag), so L/D ratio stays the same, and glide angle therefore stays the same. Due to the movement of the drag curve, though, the speed of VMD will also increase. GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. The mass of an aircraft will not change the gliding angle/range. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. GLIDING TIME The aircraft's mass changes the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio (higher VMD). Therefore, heavier aircraft have a shorter gliding time. If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.",

If the selected target V/S is too high (relative to the current thrust condition and speed), the FMGC will steer the aircraft to the target V/S, but the aircraft will also accelerate or decelerate. As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces. As a result, the vertical speed will reduce for a certain pitch attitude. The autopilot will therefore chase the selected vertical speed by pitching up. This results in further decreased IAS.

The above situation results in reduced thrust production and thus a degraded performance. The target threshold speed is an IAS and will be the same for all combinations of pressure and temperature. The true ground speed is based on the TAS, plus or minus the wind component. If the air density is low, because of the low pressure (reduced QNH), the TAS will be higher for a given IAS. Also, the groundspeed will be higher, resulting in an increase of the landing distance required. Generally, climb gradient is expressed by the formula: % Climb Gradient = ((T - D) x 100) / W. With reduced thrust, because of the less dense air, the excess of thrust (T - D) decreases. So, with constant weight and drag, the climb gradient reduces too.",

            "explanation": "Learning Objective 032.01.03.02.02: Define a propeller-driven aeroplane’s SFC and describe how it affects fuel flow and specific range. Specific range is a measure of the distance gone per unit of fuel burned. Therefore you could calculate it as Distance/Fuel burned, or by dividing these both by time, you get Speed/Fuel Flow. For Specific Air Range (SAR), which is the SR unaffected by wind, the calculation is: SAR = TAS / Fuel Flow The speed to fly to get maximum SAR is the best range speed, of course. This is because the best range speed gets the highest speed for the lowest thrust (jet) or power (prop), which means it gets the highest speed for lowest fuel burn. In a prop aircraft this is VMD and in a jet it is 1.32 x VMD. This question is not asking about speeds though. This question is asking about what altitude provides the best SAR, specifically in a propeller aircraft. As the options all mention full throttle height, we are going to assume it is a piston engine (not a turboprop). The increase in efficiency with altitude in a prop is not even close to that of a jet, and totally depends on the speeds/power settings flown. Unfortunately, this question is very vague, so we are having to make some rather large assumptions. If we make the assumption that we are cruising at best range speed, which is an indicated air speed, and with the most efficient cruise RPM set for that speed, then we can say that at higher altitudes, the TAS will be higher, but the fuel flow the same (or slightly reduced), up until the full throttle height. Remember that piston engines will also be more efficient with open throttles, for the same power output. This all means that specific air range increases with increasing altitude until the full throttle height for the best range speed, which is the most efficient altitude. Above the full throttle height, the SAR begins to reduce, as the aircraft can no longer maintain the best range speed even with maximum power, due to the low air density. Two options can be removed immediately, because the Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) in an aircraft is a measure of fuel burn per unit of thrust (or power in a prop), of which a lower value is more efficient, and the SAR is the opposite, where a higher value is most efficient. They would therefore not go the same way (It is actually possible for them to go the same way, because of how they each measure efficiency, but not in this scenario).",

Should, for any reason, the aircraft want to remain in the air for a longer time, they can descend at the best glide endurance speed. By flying slightly slower than VMD, the aircraft has slightly more drag, so a steeper descent angle, but is flying down that angle at a much reduced speed, overall leading to a lesser rate of descent, and a longer time in the air. This reduced speed for best endurance in a glide is VMP, the speed for minimum power required. It is not affected by what type of engine the aircraft has, because this is a glide descent, so the engine is not functioning. It is also not affected by headwinds or tailwinds, as they do not increase or decrease rate of descent, they only change where the aircraft will eventually meet the surface, not how long the descent will take.",

At this point, the aircraft is unable to accelerate and will maintain the speed. The maximum speed (VMAX) has been reached => this is shown as the intersection of the \"available\" and \"required\" curves. As altitude increases, the air becomes less dense.

Please send us any exam feedback about this question, either in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com. thank you! Specific Range (SR) is one of the measures of efficiency for an aircraft, as it is the distance the aircraft can fly per unit of fuel used (higher is better). The easiest formula for it is: Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow There is another value similar to this which measures the engine efficiency, and that is the Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), measuring the fuel used to create each unit of thrust (lower is better). For a jet engine, the formula for it is: Specific Fuel Consumption = Fuel Flow/Thrust Putting the two together with a little rearranging, we can get the formula: SR = TAS/(SFC x Thrust) Aircraft engines are most efficient (low SFC) in cold temperatures and running at high RPM. Aircraft aerodynamics have the best range when flying at the speed for highest IAS to drag ratio, which is the speed 1.32 x VMD. We can call it the best range speed. To make these two high efficiency zones match up, the optimum conditions for jet aircraft are at high altitudes, when the jet engines have to run at around 90% RPM (in efficient cold air) to maintain the best drag speed. This also provides a very high TAS due to the low density, optimising the Specific Range formula above (high TAS, low SFC, low thrust).",

The high speed buffet boundary describes the IAS at which we find the onset of Mach related buffet, normally MMO, but sometimes slightly below that. At low altitudes, these speeds are far apart, leaving a wide range of operating speeds. Although stalling IAS remains constant at first as altitude increases, it starts to increase at higher altitude. Also, the IAS at which we get Mach buffet will steadily decrease, because TAS increases in the climb and local speed of sound decreases. The two buffet boundaries will move closer toogether and eventually meet at an altitude where no margins exists, the coffin corner or aerodynamic ceiling, i.e. you cannot fly faster or slower because you will either stall or hit MMO. The right-hand limit on the graph shows the maximum indicated airspeed VMO and then at high altitude the maximum Mach number, MMO. The left-hand limit is based on the stall speed, 1.1 VS. Therefore, with increasing altitude, the low-speed buffet will increase and the high-speed buffet will decrease.",

Therefore, less fuel is required to maintain a constant power output. So, the fuel flow will decrease, not increase. Increasing the fuel flow in an effort to compensate for the decrease in air density would result in an over-rich mixture and potentially cause engine damage. What exactly do they mean by \"maintaining the same power setting?\". We believe it is referring to the amount of power the pilot is requesting from the engine, not the actual power output of the engine. In order to maintain the same power setting, the pilot will likely have to lean the mixture (decrease the fuel flow) to compensate for the decrease in air density at higher altitude. So, even though the pilot is requesting the same amount of power, the engine will produce less power due to the decrease in air density, and the fuel flow will decrease to match the decrease in oxygen available. Note: We are deciding that \"power setting\" means constant RPM/MAP for this question. Please let us know if you come across this question in your official exam.",

            "explanation": "To start with, we can assume that the jet aircraft is flying for best range, and when the temperature decreases, the aircraft continues to fly for best range. The decrease in temperature is good for a jet engine's specific fuel consumption, and cold temperatures and high RPM operation both count to decreasing the engine's specific fuel consumption, which allows it to produce more thrust per kg of fuel burnt. Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow and Fuel Flow = SFC x Drag So as the aircraft's SFC has decreased, and the Drag has remained the same (jets cruise at constant Mach numbers and when only the temperature changes, the IAS also remains constant), so Fuel Flow has decreased. Now we can also say that TAS will decrease, as the density has increased. That means that both the top of the Specific Range equation (TAS) has decreased, and the bottom (Fuel Flow) has also decreased. We do not have exact figures, so how can we work out what the overall effect is? We know from the integrated range tables in the flight planning CAP (697) that a decrease in temperature causes a decrease in fuel consumption over the distances involved in the table, meaning the effect on specific fuel consumption must be the greater effect, and cold temperatures increase specific range. Now the question does not mention this, but with this colder temperature, the aircraft (ATC notwithstanding) will have a slightly higher optimum altitude, and at that altitude, will gain even higher efficiencies from this temperature drop if it able to climb to this higher altitude.

It is the result of form drag and skin friction drag, and is what a car has to overcome (as well as road friction) when it drives along a flat road. Parasite increases with the square of the airspeed, so gets very high when aircraft fly fast. Induced drag is more complex. Its full name is \"lift-induced drag\", and occurs due to our wings re-directing the airflow downwards. The pressure differential (high below, low above) caused by our wing's shape (aerofoil) makes the air want to take a shortcut around the wingtip, which creates sideways movement of air, and creates vortices of air around the wing. To cut an incredibly long explanation short, this energy loss (to create these vortices) is what we know as induced drag, and increases with Coefficient of lift. This means that induced drag is increased when: weight is increased (more weight = more lift required = higher lift coefficient). indicated airspeed, IAS, is decreased (less airflow means we need each particle of air to bend more, so higher lift coefficient - or just look at the lift equation, if speed reduces, something has to increase for the same lift to be made). Anything else causes an increased angle of attack (as angle of attack is directly proportional to coefficient of lift up until the stall). Therefore, given the possible options, the only correct one is \"aircraft weight\". Note: changing altitude does not affect induced drag in this question as we are flying at a constant IAS, which means that the same amount of air particles are flowing over the wing, no matter the altitude we are at, and compressibility effects are to be ignored.",

The increased drag from flaps increases our gradient of descent in accordance with the following formula. Gradient of Descent (%) = [(D - T) / W] x 100 As we are maintaining a constant TAS (True Airspeed), then the Rate of Descent increases also, due to the following formula. ROD (ft/m) = TAS x Gradient of Descent Note: we are not taking into account any wind in these calculations, therefore the gradients of descent are \"still air\" gradients, but wind would not change the answers at all.",

Flying higher or lower than the optimum altitude will decrease the range of the airplane. It is important to understand that the optimum altitude is not fixed. As the weight decreases through fuel burn, the drag curve moves down and left. Therefore, the best range speed, 1.32VMD, falls and the total drag decreases. With decreasing weight, the airplane needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed. As it does so, the Mach number will also decrease meaning that the airplane is not limited by the high Mach number and corresponding high drag. This fact allows the airplane to climb a little. As the airplane climbs, the Mach number will increase again to its previous limiting value and drag will increase back to its previous value. But more importantly the higher altitude has decreased the specific fuel consumption. This means that over time, as the weight decreases with fuel burn, the optimum altitude increases. SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ FUEL FLOW Reaching the optimum level, the aircraft specific range increases. As the aircraft mass decreases due to fuel consumption the optimum level will be higher. If the aircraft does not climb to the new optimum altitude the specific range decreases.",

The majority of the statements in this question are quite simple, the ASDA includes the TORA (Take-Off Run Available), and the stopway for the take-off runway, but not the clearway. The other two statements are a little more complex. A starter extension is where a displaced threshold exists, and an aircraft can begin the take-off roll before the threshold of the runway. Therefore, any starter extension is part of the take-off run, and is included in the ASDA. However, the opposite runway stopway (if present) is not automatically considered a starter extension for the take-off runway, so is not included.

            "explanation": "The overall fuel efficiency of a jet engine is usually expressed in terms of its Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) and its propulsive and thermal efficiencies. The overall fuel efficiency of a piston engine is measured by its Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) only. SFC is the mass of fuel required to produce a given amount of power/thrust for a given period of time. The Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) formulae are: For a propeller aircraft: SFC = Fuel Flow / Power. For a jet aircraft: SFC = Fuel Flow / Thrust. So, for a propeller aircraft, Fuel Flow = SFC x Power, which means that for a given SFC the fuel flow is proportional to the power required. Thus, the lower the SFC, the better the efficiency.",

Because thrust available against speed is different for turbojet and propeller aeroplanes, it must be established at what speed VX is for both types of aeroplanes. For best angle of climb we need maximum excess thrust. If thrust were constant at all airspeeds, then at VMD where drag is minimum, the excess thrust and climb angle would be maximum. For maximum endurance we must fly at the speed at which fuel flow is minimum. Rate of climb is maximum when excess power is maximum. This occurs at approximately VMP. In prop aircraft fuel flow is proportional to power, so minimum fuel flow occurs at the speed at which power required is minimum. This speed is VMP. Rate of climb is equal to excess power divided by aircraft weight.",

Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow and Fuel Flow = SFC x Drag So as the aircraft's SFC has increased, and the Drag has remained the same (jets cruise at constant Mach numbers and when only the temperature changes, the IAS also remains constant), so Fuel Flow has increased. Now we can also say that TAS will increase, as the density has decreased. That means that both the top of the Specific Range equation (TAS) has increased, and the bottom (Fuel Flow) has also increased. We do not have exact figures, so how can we work out what the overall effect is? We know from the integrated range tables in the flight planning CAP (697) that an increase in temperature causes a increase in fuel consumption over the distances involved in the table, meaning the effect on specific fuel consumption must be the greater effect, and warmer temperatures decrease specific range. Therefore the correct answer is \"SR decreases, SFC increases.\"",

This requires a balancing downforce from the tail plane. With this extra force from the tail plane, lift from the wings must be increased to balance the forces. More lift means more induced drag, which means higher fuel consumption consequently decreasing the maximum range. For an aft CG position, the opposite applies, lower fuel consumption and maximum range increases.",

Using a standard force diagram for an aircraft in the climb gives the equations: (Thrust - Drag)/Weight = sin(angle of climb) Lift/Weight = cos(angle of climb) The first equation is the one to use, and 7% Notes: The force diagram image uses α (alpha) for the climb angle and we are using γ (gamma), either is fine to use, but α is often used for angle of attack so we avoid it for angle of climb. Assuming \"Lift = Weight\" is a bit of a stretch, yes, as lift does not equal weight in the climb, but it is what EASA want you to do, so they can give you more complex questions like this without you having to do too much maths. This allows us to use L/D ratio very easily, so works nicely, even if not fully correct. sin(γ) is a good approximation of the gradient for small angles, even though tan is technically the one to use, they are very close in the angles we usually climb at. We have to convert from a decimal gradient to a percentage at the end by multiplying by 100.",

As they are only going to end up holding anyway, they might as well save some fuel in the cruise, and have to do less holding patterns later on. This is assuming that they have already \"joined the queue\" at their destination airport, which is implied in the question. The best endurance speed in a jet aircraft is the speed at which the engines need to produce the least thrust, as thrust is directly proportional to fuel flow, and we want to make our fuel flow the lowest it can be. The speed of minimum thrust required is the speed of least drag (as thrust directly opposed drag). We called this VMD, for minimum drag speed, and it is the speed that aircraft fly in the holding pattern, and when it is time in the air that is most desirable, rather than distance gone. It occurs at the bottom of the \"total drag\" curve as shown in the annex above, where the combination of induced and parasite drag equals the lowest value. There is no point climbing up to the optimum altitude at this stage, as it is not an efficient use of fuel to climb just before descent. Also, that option is not correct because we do not care about maximum range now, only maximum endurance.",

Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean.",

For an airplane powered by jet engines, VX is the same IAS as VMD. VX for a propeller airplane is less than VMD and at low altitudes will be in the region of VMP due to the way power is produced by propeller aircraft. This is also roughly the same speed as maximum endurance due to the minimum drag/power required. VY - Best Rate of Climb Speed The speed to gain more altitude with the least time (Greatest Rate of Climb). This speed is faster than VX as the rate of climb can be improved by speeding up the aircraft. Even though this means higher drag, this drag increase is overwhelmed by the speed increase, which means the aircraft is climbing up a shallower slope, but at a higher speed, so has an overall greater climb rate. It is roughly the same speed as that of maximum range. For a jet, this means it is higher than VMD (usually quoted as 1.32 VMD with maximum range), and for a prop aircraft, this speed should be around VMD. For this question, then, we have to assume that a jet aircraft is being flown, as in a propeller aircraft, VY is effectively the same speed as VMD in most cases, so they could not slow down to VMD If the pilot is flying at VY and slows down to VMD (which is VX), the climb gradient will increase, but the rate of climb will decrease (after the airspeed has stabilised at VX).",

Question 812798 is the PoF counterpart, but this question has been identified at least twice in Performance exams, so we have put it in both subjects. The figure shows the changes that take place as the aircraft speed (TAS) increases. Assuming that propeller RPM and blade pitch angle remains constant, at a low speed the angle of attack will be large, giving a lot of thrust. Alpha will reduce with increasing speed and at about 4 degrees the blade will be operating at its best lift/drag ratio, i.e. the propeller is achieving its highest efficiency. Higher speeds (which can usually only be reached in a dive) will reduce the blade angle of attack to its zero lift value of about minus 4 degrees. At this point, the propeller will be producing zero thrust. The thrust that is produced by the propeller depends on the angle of attack of the blade. The angle of attack of the blade depends in turn on the airspeed and induced airflow through the propeller. At low airspeeds the angle of attack will be large, near the stall, and thrust will be at its maximum. As forward speed increases, the angle of attack decreases and thrust reduces. That means that the maximum thrust produced by a propeller driven aircraft, also occurs at zero forward airspeed and reduces with forward speed. A fixed propeller can only have one optimum combination of forward airspeed and engine RPM and only one optimum propeller efficiency. At all other combinations it operates less efficiently. This effect can be offset to an extent by using a variable pitch propeller, which can change the blade angle, coarsening the blade angle at higher speeds to maintain the optimum angle of attack.",

As we understood from the definition above; mass and the dissemination of the weight to the compartments of aircraft directly effects the service ceiling. FACTORS AFFECTING TAKE-OFF DISTANCE REQUIRED The take-off distance required (TODR) varies with aerodrome conditions, aeroplane mass, and aeroplane configuration. AEROPLANE MASS A heavier aeroplane accelerates more slowly and needs to achieve a faster take-off speed. This results in a longer take-off distance required. When the TODR equals the take-off distance available (TODA), the aeroplane is at its field limited take-off mass (FLTOM) for the given flap setting. AERODROME PRESSURE ALTITUDE The higher an aerodrome’s pressure altitude, the longer the TODR. This is because the air is less dense, which affects both the engine thrust and actual speed at rotation. The reduction in air density reduces the engine mass flow and, therefore, thrust, which results in slower acceleration. Second, the reduced air density results in a faster TAS for the same calibrated airspeed VR. TEMPERATURE Hotter temperatures result in lower air density. Again, this reduces the thrust and, therefore, acceleration of the aeroplane and necessitates a faster TAS for the same VR. WIND The head or tailwind component along the runway affects the ground speed of the aeroplane for the same rotate speed, VR, which is a CAS. A reducing headwind or increasing tailwind increases the actual ground speed, which equates to the same VR. Acceleration to a faster actual ground speed results in a longer take-off run and distance.",

To help correct for these unwanted conditions, the aircraft is flown using the balance part of the turn and balance indicator During a balanced turn the ball remains in the centre of the balance indicator and the pilot remains upright in the seat relative to the aircraft, with no tendency to lean. Rate of turn is the measurement of how long it takes for an aircraft to turn, measured in degrees per second. This is particularly important during instrument flying where rate-1 turns are usually carried out at a rate of 3° per second. This means that the aircraft turns through 180° in 1 minute, or 360° in 2 minutes. A steeper angle of bank is required to carry out a rate-1 turn at higher airspeeds. To solve this exercise, first we need to calculate how many degrees was the turn performed and then apply the rate of turn: 334º - 214º = 120º at 3º/second (rate-1 turn) 120/3º = 40 seconds Note: This question is out of the scope of performance, however a student has confirmed that it appeared in their performance exam.",

Therefore, the total power required increases and the selected airspeed will increase as well as moves to the right. An alternative explanation comes throught the Lift formula: L = CL ½ rho V2 S. At a higher gross mass, the Lift required must be increased, to maintain the altitude. With CL (angle of attack) and S (configuration) constant, the airspeed, V, must be increased, so as to increase the Lift required and maintain the altitude constant. The power required is: DRAG x AIRSPEED. With increased Lift required, the induced drag increases and as a result the total drag increases, too.

This would decrease lift and drag if we were trying to maintain the same TAS. However, to counteract this effect, we fly our aircraft at a constant IAS/CAS (Indicated Airspeed/Calibrated Airspeed), which is a simple measure of dynamic pressure. This value measures the amount of air particles hitting the aircraft, and their speed. If we fly at a constant IAS, but climb higher in the atmosphere, the lower air density means that we have to fly faster to get the same amount of dynamic pressure, meaning the same amount of air particles over the wing, etc. This is an increase in TAS (True Airspeed) for a constant IAS. IAS directly controls our drag and our lift, as they vary proportionally to dynamic pressure, see the lift or drag equation for the mathematical proof here, it is very easy to spot. D = (1/2 x ρ x V2)x CD x S As dynamic pressure is 1/2 x ρ x V2, which is measured by the IAS, then drag is directly proportional to IAS, coefficient of drag, and surface area. If the graph was for total drag against IAS, then the curve would remain in exactly the same position with increased altitude (ignoring compressibility at very high altitudes). As the X-axis on the graphs is TAS, not IAS, then with an increase in altitude, the drag curve will look the same, but will be shifted to the right, due to the increased TAS for the same IAS at higher altitudes, but as the same forces of drag exist at each point on the curve, the curve will not move up or down. The answer is therefore figure 3, moving to the right.",

            "explanation": "SPECIFIC FUEL CONSUMPTION Specific fuel consumption (SFC) in a jet is the fuel flow per unit of thrust, while SFC for a propeller is the fuel flow per unit of power. It is a measurement of efficiency, lower SFC means less fuel used, so is better. It is also an engine measurement, not to do with the aircraft's aerodynamics. In a turbojet engine, SFC is lowest (which is best) when the air temperature is low, and also when the engine is running at its design RPM of approximately 90 to 95% rpm. This means that SFC is proportional to temperature. It also means that the engine-aircraft combination is most efficient at high altitude where the thrust required to overcome drag is approximately 90 to 95% of the thrust available. This creates an optimum altitude for a turbojet engine where the most efficient engine speed lines up with the most efficient airframe speed. This is an aerodynamic consideration though, and is not actually about the SFC This then gets a little complex, as SFC, (being engine dictated, not aerodynamic) is not actually to do with the pressure of the air (pressure altitude), but actually changes based on the temperature of the air, colder air being more efficient to burn, therefore lower SFC. The problem with this is that the pressure altitude usually dictates the temperature, higher altitude = colder temperatures = lower SFC. This means that we are going to have to discount the answer that states, \"Altitude has NO effect on SFC.\", because it does affect it, just via the changing temperatures. The answer doesn't leave any \"wiggle room\" to argue its case, so we cannot declare it true. Therefore we have to choose the answer stating, \"SFC decreases at higher altitudes and cold ambient temperatures.\", because this effectively goes through our own thought process of working out SFC, higher altitude = colder temperature = lower SFC.

We also know that: Sin Climb angle = (Thrust - Drag) / Weight = (300000 N - 114743.6 N) / 895000 N = 0.207 Thus, the climb gradient expressed in percentage will be: Climb Gradient (%) = Tan Climb angle x 100 = Sin Climb angle x 100 = 0.207 X 100 = 20.7%.",

This assumption works fine for the exams, but in reality there are other factors at play that skew the graphs a little. Jet Aircraft Endurance Maximum endurance will occur at minimum fuel flow. In a jet aircraft means minimum thrust and therefore minimum drag, VMD. Propeller Aircraft Endurance Minimum fuel flow for a propeller aircraft occurs when power required is minimum, so the speed to fly for endurance is VMP. VMP is minimum power to maintain straight and level flight, always less than VMD therefore the speed is unstable. Jet Aircraft Range The greatest still air range will occur when we get the largest TAS for the smallest thrust required, the best TAS/DRAG ratio. This point lies at the tangent of the drag curve (from the origin), 1.32VMD. Propeller Aircraft Range The greatest still air range will occur when we get the largest TAS for the smallest power required (not thrust). This point lies at the tangent of the power curve, VMD.

SFC varies with the ambient conditions. SFC is best at a minimum and one of the factors it is dependent upon include: Temperature. In cold air, at a particular altitude, the RPM may be reduced to provide the power required because: (a) The power available from the engine is greater. (b) The power required to propel the airframe in cold air is less. The colder the temperature, therefore, the lower will be the SFC because the power absorbed (wasted) at the lower temperature is reduced and the thermal efficiency is increased. As temperature increases, the air becomes less dense. Consequently, engine efficiency decreases and SFC increases. If 1º on ISA gives +0.2% fuel flow increase per unit of thrust, 10º will give an increase of 2%.",

However, a Speed faster or slower than VMD will lead to steeper glide angles. Glide angle = CD / CL GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. GLIDING TIME The aircraft's mass varies the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio (higher VMD). If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.

In a jet aircraft, VMD gives us the Best Endurance and Best Angle of Climb (VX). When flaps are put down, this does not affect our induced drag, as our lift value remains the same (equal to our weight). It does increase our parasite drag though, by presenting a larger surface to the airflow, and therefore increases our overall drag. This means that more thrust is required with flaps out, and therefore we will burn fuel faster, as well as flying slower, due to lower VMD speed in a “dirty” configuration.

When the CG of an aircraft is further forward, the aircraft will be more nose heavy, and to counteract this, the tailplane provides a downforce on the tail in order to keep the nose of the aircraft up. This downforce directly opposes what the main wing is doing, producing lift. Therefore, the greater the downforce, the greater the lift that the main wing needs to produce. For every bit of lift the wing produces though, there is some induced drag that occurs, which means that further forward CG locations cause higher drag, and therefore lower climb performance, shorter aircraft range, and generally worse efficiency.",

For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. => With flaps down, Rate of Climb should be lower compared to clean configuration.

Effect of configuration on VX The aircraft configuration is a determining factor that influences the maximum climb angle. In the first image provided, a climb with flaps (or gear) extended is illustrated and compared to the clean configuration. The first figure depicts an increase in parasite area which results in a higher parasite drag. Consequently, the total drag curve shifts upwards and to the left. The thrust required also increases, leading to a slower IAS for VX. As the necessary thrust has increased, the excess thrust decreases, which in turn causes a decrease in maximum climb gradient. Ultimately, flaps or gear usage reduces both maximum climb gradient and VX. Therefore, in this case, the retraction of flaps/slats will result in an increase in VX. Effect of configuration on VY The power required curves will undergo a similar shift as the drag curve. The second figure depicts a decrease in the available excess power, which is indicated by the blue double-headed arrows. As you may remember, a decrease in excess power leads to a reduction in the rate of climb. Nonetheless, the critical point to note is that the speed for maximum excess power is no longer the same when the gear and/or flaps are extended. Instead, it becomes lower. As a result, the climb rate and VY are reduced with the gear and/or flaps extended. Therefore, in this case, the retraction of flaps/slats will result in an increase in VY.",

Recent feedback has confirmed the correct option to be VMD. The correct option in the initial feedback was VMO. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in an exam, and any information you have about it, as our feedback may not be complete. Alternatively, feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. There is also a very similar question in POF, but we are not sure of the validity of the limited feedback for that question. In the event of a fuel leak, our main problem as a flight crew is the chance of fuel exhaustion before a safe landing has been made. It is for that reason that we must make our way to the nearest suitable airfield as fast as possible, but by using the least amount of fuel; after all, we do not want to run out of fuel faster than we have to, by using it or by leaking it. It is for this reason that we have to fly at the best range speed, the same as we would when we want to reach a destination whilst using as little fuel as possible. However, this is a different \"best range\" speed. When we are leaking out fuel, our total fuel \"consumption\" changes, and goes from the standard fuel consumption/speed curve (which closely follows the drag curve), to the same curve, just lifted up, as the fuel consumption has been increased across the board by whatever rate the fuel is leaking at. Of course, the leak could be variable with speed or pressure, etc. but this is the general idea of it, and we should not have to delve as far as those factors. The best range of an aircraft is the point at which the fuel consumption is lowest for the highest speed, and this is shown on the graph by the point where a line from the origin first touches the curve. As you can see in the annex above, the best range speed is higher for the curve with the fuel leak. This is because the fuel is also leaking from the tank, and the faster we go, the less we allow to leak from the tank overall, so the more we have available to burn. This finds an equilibrium with how much drag we are willing to accept by flying faster, and therefore burning fuel at a higher rate. The faster the fuel leak, the higher this optimal speed becomes, starting at the normal \"Best Range\" speed for a very small/no leak, and increasing to VMO for incredibly fast fuel leaks. Further note: We would prefer an answer that mentions something to do with the increased best range speed, or perhaps a speed between best range speed (or LRC) and VMO. Important note: The current feedback is conflicting between exam authorities about which answer is correct. Some say that VMO is correct, and some say VMD is the correct option, please let us know what you get in you exam, and if any appeal process you might decide to take is successful or not.",

Thankfully, we can ignore the extra drag of a failed engine and a larger aircraft, which are not part of the power to weight ratio. Therefore, looking at the options, if the aircraft were at the same gross weight (1250 kg), then the power to weight ratios would be the same.

Please let us know in the comments if you see any version of this question in your real exam, and what you can remember from it, thank you! When aircraft are being certified, the manufacturer must test the aircraft in many different ways to define certain levels of performance for many phases of flight, such as take-off distance, maximum rate of climb, landing distance and many more. There are different types of performance categorisation. Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1.",

The amount of excess thrust (divided by the mass of the aircraft) decides the angle of climb. The airspeed then decides how quickly we fly up that angle, the rate of climb. Between VX and VY (Best angle and best rate of climb, respectively), the excess thrust (therefore angle of climb) decreases, but the airspeed increases significantly moreso, so we travel up a lower angle, but at a much higher speed, gaining altitude quicker (see annex above). To gain the most \"excess thrust\", which is just thrust minus drag, we should fly at the lowest drag speed (which is an IAS, so does not change with altitude), and produce the most thrust possible. Therefore, to get the best climb performance, we just need to increase thrust. The highest thrust possible from any engine (jet or propeller) is at high air density, so low temperatures and low pressure altitudes.",

A climb gradient of 3% means that for every 100 feet (or 30 meters) of distance traveled, the aircraft will climb 3 feet (or 1 meter). Climb angle, on the other hand, is the angle between the aircraft's flight path and the horizontal plane. It is measured in degrees and is a more intuitive measure of the aircraft's rate of ascent. For example, a climb angle of 15 degrees means that the aircraft is climbing at an angle of 15 degrees relative to the horizon.",

Propeller aircraft cannot measure thrust output, only power (Power = Thrust x Velocity). This means that it is often useful to change thrust required (drag) graphs into power required graphs, by multiplying by speed (TAS) again. The curve looks the same, but if you get to compare them, the power required curve is steeper and a little to the left. This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; for increased altitude, the power required curve will look almost the same, but for each point on the curve (which is a certain IAS), the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards). The graph therefore moves upwards and rightwards, away from the origin, so figure 2 is correct.",

Note: There have in the past been some reports of this being seen saying just “excess thrust” in the question, which would be misleading, incorrect and outside of the learning objectives. As indicated in the comments, more recently, the correct wording of “excess thrust required” has been seen instead. Please do report back if it is worded differently in the exam, thanks! In the descent, assuming that the aircraft is maintaining it's speed (and not accelerating), the aircraft's drag must be higher than its forward engine thrust. Therefore, in the forward thrust terms, there is only \"negative excess thrust\", or “excess thrust required”, or “excess drag”. The excess drag (excess thrust required) is therefore equal to Drag minus Thrust, and this excess drag will have to be equaled by the proportion of weight acting in the direction of travel for a steady descent.",

            "explanation": "Either of the \"Aquaplanning\" or \"Hydroplanning\" terms can be used to refer to a condition where the tyre's tread is unable to clear all the surface water from under the wheel. Water is then pushed ahead of the tyre and forms a wedge that lifts the tyre off the runway. This results in a loss of braking and directional control. The tyre can become scalded and blister, as friction causes the water to heat up and eventually boil, as it is pushed along the runway. There are three forms of hydroplanning that should be considered for Contaminated Runway Operations: Dynamic Hydroplanning Viscous Hydroplanning Reverted Rubber Hydroplanning The point at which the aircraft starts to plane is called the Dynamic Hydroplanning speed. This can be approximated from one of the two formulae below: Hydroplanning speed (kt) = 9 x square root(P/ρ), for a rotating tyre (take-off) Hydroplanning speed (kt) = 7.7 x square root(P/ρ), for a non-rotating tyre (landing), where P is the tyre pressure in PSI and ρ is the Specific Gravity (SG) of the contaminant. If the contaminant is water, where SG=1, then the speed might be described as the Dynamic Aquaplanning Speed and the formula given just as: 9 x square root of the tyre pressure in PSI or 7.7 x square root of the tyre pressure in PSI. A thin film or fluid on a smooth runway surface prevents the tyre from making contact with the runway. Viscous Hydroplanning can occur at much lower speeds than dynamic hydroplanning and is most likely on a smooth, dirty surface. Runway touchdown areas are likely to provide these conditions. Reverted Rubber Hydroplanning occurs after a skid, often on the nosewheel which has neither braking nor anti-skid protection. The high temperature created by friction, boil a thin layer of water and vaporised rubber to steam to support the tyre. This is likely if the nosewheel steering is used indiscriminately on a slippery runway. If the take-off is rejected the contaminant which resisted acceleration now becomes as slippery as sin and braking action is drastically reduced.",

However, a student has reported that he came across this question in his Performance exam. NARROW RUNWAY A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is higher than it actually is. If you believe this illusion, you may pitch the aircraft’s nose down to lose altitude. If this happens too close to the ground, you may land short of the runway and cause an accident. WIDE RUNWAY A wider-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is lower than it actually is, leading to a higher approach. If you believe this illusion, you may respond by pitching the aircraft’s nose up to gain altitude, which may result in a low-altitude stall or missed approach",

Therefore, maximum endurance is reached by finding an optimum of the product IAS x drag, and then making sure TAS is as small as possible for this IAS. At higher altitude, a given IAS results in a higher TAS and consequently more power required.

Power is the rate of doing work, and is the amount of thrust x True Air Speed. As thrust required = drag, we can say Power Required = Drag x TAS. Also, the maximum endurance speed for a propeller aircraft is the speed at which it is producing the least engine power, minimum power speed (VMP). In propeller aeroplanes we tend to fly at a constant IAS/CAS and accept the TAS that results, as this allows us to have a constant stall speed (and other speeds) at any altitude. When we maintain our IAS and fly higher, we get a higher TAS to account for the lower air density, and still give us the same lift force. This means that at higher altitude, the TAS increases, so therefore the power required increases as well. As Power Required is based on TAS, it means we also measure the speed for minimum power (VMP) in terms of TAS as well, which increases with altitude, so therefore VMP (which is Maximum Endurance speed) increases.",

The power required curve is determined for each speed by multiplying the drag at that speed by the TAS. Note that the question states constant AOA, mass and configuration. The increase in altitude will increase TAS and the thrust required to maintain the constant angle of attack at the same mass and configuration. Power required = Drag x TAS so power required increases. (drag stays almost constant). The drag stays constant with the increase in altitude but the TAS increases therefore the power required increases. If you have a 10% increase in TAS then there will be a 10% increase in power required. In ISA conditions the increase in power required will increase by the same percentage increase as the TAS increase.",

For a jet aircraft, this occurs at high altitudes, where the jet engines are running at approximately 90% RPM, and the thrust produced allows the aircraft to fly at its best range speed (IAS), for best speed to drag ratio. It is usually quite close to an aircraft's maximum altitude (for a jet), and above or below it will be a less efficient altitude. If the aircraft is below its optimum altitude, then the engines will be running at a lower RPM to produce the same speed due to the higher air density, which is less efficient, or the aircraft will fly faster for the same engine RPM, which causes higher drag, and is less efficient. If the aircraft is above its optimum altitude, then the engines will be running at a higher RPM (closer to 100%), which reduces efficiency again, increasing fuel burn and engine wear. This question tells us by how much our fuel burn is affected when off altitude, and you simply multiply the percentage by how many 1000's of feet different from the optimum altitude the aircraft is, and the change is always a reduction in specific range. Sometimes the penalty for being off altitude is shown in a table, as seen in the annex above.",

            "explanation": "CG position VS Aircraft’s performance A tail down force (created by the elevator) exists to balance the moment created between the CG and CP of the wing. Essentially, the tail works as an upside down wing which generates lift downwards. The amount of lift it needs to generate will depend on CG position and aircraft weight. Consequently, when the CG moves forward and aft, tail down force and lift required for a stable flight will change. FORWARD CG increases the pitch down moment tendency of the aircraft. Therefore, greater horizontal stabilizer and elevator deflections are needed to give the aircraft a pitch-up attitude to compensate for the pitch-down moment. Extra lift is generated by increasing the angle of attack, which in turn increases induced drag. Thus performance decreases. For take-off, if the CG position is too far forward, the aircraft is said to have a “heavy nose”. Conversely, as the CG MOVES REARWARD, the aircraft will experience a reduced pitch down moment tendency, resulting in less tail-down force being required. As a consequence, drag decreases (and so does stalling speed) which improves performance. Since Climb gradient is a product of excess of thrust over drag, climb performance will be improved. For take-off, if the CG position is too far aft, the aircraft is said to have a “light nose” making the rotation easier. Additionally, an aircraft which requires less lift will have a slower rotation speed, which results in a reduced take-off distance. To simplify this concept and make it easier to answer these type of question you can think of a forward CG as having the same effects as a heavy aircraft; and an aft CG as having the same result as a light aircraft.",

            "explanation": "When aircraft are being certified, the manufacturer must test the aircraft in many different ways to define certain levels of performance for many phases of flight, such as take-off distance, maximum rate of climb, landing distance and many more. There are different types of performance categorisation: Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1. So now we know that the gross climb gradient does NOT include a safety margin, which removes two possible answers. It then depends on how you interpret the two other answers, and whether the \"actual\" or \"calculated\" climb gradients can be said to contain a safety margin or not. \"Actual climb gradient\" can be argued either way in our opinion, it could contain a safety margin by the fact that the aircraft achieving a certain gradient needs no further safety reduction (is already corrected from the performance figures by real life performance), or you could say that no further reduction to that gradient is required, so no safety margin is included. \"Calculated climb gradient\", on the other hand, could mean either gross or net climb gradient, as they are both calculated. One with a safety margin, the other is without. Option D says that the 3 terms are the same, which is certainly NOT true as \"gross\" and \"actual\" are not usually the same, so that leaves us with only one option remaining, and it assumes that \"calculated\" means \"net\", and that \"actual climb gradient\" includes a safety margin. NOTE: Having only received one count of feedback for this question, we cannot confirm that this will be exactly replicated in your real exam, so please do let us know in the comments if you see this question, and whatever you might be able to remember from it, thank you!",

For a jet aeroplane, Fuel Flow = Fuel Flow per unit Thrust (SFC) x Total Thrust The aim is to reduce the amount of fuel used to produce each thrust unit (SFC needs to be small). For a jet engine this occurs when ambient temperature is very low and engine rpm is very high. This can only occur at high altitude. So, flying at high altitude, minimizes the fuel used per unit of thrust. In level flight the forward acting force of thrust is controlled and balanced by the rearward acting force of drag. If drag is small, the aeroplane need fly with only a small amount of thrust. Therefore, on the formula above, “Total Thrust” can be replaced by “Total Drag”. To minimize drag, the jet aeroplane simply flies at the velocity for minimum drag. In summary then, for a jet aeroplane to maximize its endurance by minimizing its fuel flow, the pilot would fly the aeroplane at VMD and fly as high as possible.",

Power = Thrust x Speed (TAS) Power required = Thrust Required x Speed (TAS) Thrust produced by an engine decreases with altitude because of decreasing air density, which does not allow the engine to burn as much fuel, and create as big explosions. Similarly, power available will decrease with increasing altitude. However, power required rises with increasing altitude. This is because the aircraft flying at constant lift resulting from constant Indicated Airspeed and angle of attack will essentially fly at a higher True Airspeed at a higher altitude because the loss of air density must be compensated for by an increased speed of flight to maintain the required dynamic pressure on the wings. It is important to note for this next section that the shape of the thrust required / available graphs are based on IAS initially, but are converted to TAS to be more useful with Power Required / Power Available, which are created from the thrust graphs using TAS via the formulas above. In this question, then, we are descending, so we are expecting our Power Required to decrease, and our TAS for each point on the graph to decrease also, so the Power Required vs. TAS graph will move down and to the left. Also, the Power Available will increase as we descend into denser air, and the TAS will also decrease for every point on the graph, the same as before, to make the Power Available vs TAS graph move up and to the left. The annex above shows what happens to the curves when the aircraft descends (as in this question).",

In most cases the published aeroplane performance data gives take-off and landing distance assuming a level runway. In the case of a sloping runway the effect of gravity will be to shorten the take-off run required (TORR) and the take-off distance required (TODR) when the slope is downhill. An uphill slope will provide the opposite effect, increasing TORR and TODR. In the case of landing a downhill sloping runway will extend the landing distance required (LDR), whereas an uphill slope will decrease it. Consequently, it may be necessary to reduce the aircraft weight for an uphill take-off or a downhill landing. It should also be borne in mind that, as with the landing case, an abandoned take-off will require a greater stopping distance on a down- sloping runway.",

During climb with a steady speed, the thrust and the two retarding effects of aerodynamic drag and the weight element must be equal: T = D + W x Sin Climb angle. Solving for Sin Climb angle, we get: Sin Climb angle = (T - D) / W. If we recognise that for small angles the Sine in the climb equals to the Tangent and that Tangent in turn is the amount of height gained per unit of distance, we get an approximate formula for the Climb Gradient: %Climb Gradient = (T - D) x 100 / W. Therefore, RoC = (Climb gradient x TAS), approximately.",

            "explanation": "When an aircraft has excess performance during takeoff, using maximum thrust is unnecessary and choosing a lower thrust setting offers benefits in engine life and costs. Two procedures exist: flex takeoff and derated thrust takeoff. The flex take-off is achieved by calculating an assumed or flex temperature that is higher than the ambient which will, when entered into the FMS, give a thrust setting lower than full thrust. The flex temperature will always be higher than the ambient temperature. On a flex take-off the reduced thrust setting for take-off will not need to be increased if there is an engine failure but, in emergency, it can be. Full thrust may be applied at any time. According to AMC 25-13: \"When operating with reduced (flex) take-off thrust, the thrust setting parameter, which establishes thrust for take-off, is not considered a take-off operating limit\". Because full thrust can be applied at any time on a flex take-off, the speeds VMCG and VMCA must be corrected for full thrust, not the reduced thrust setting. A flex take-off is not considered to be a normal take-off, is always at the discretion of the pilot and is not authorised on wet runways, unless suitable performance accountability is made for the increased stopping distance on a wet runway. As most operators account for this, we can assume that flex thrust take-offs are allowed on a wet runway, but not on a contaminated runway. Throughout the flex take-off, a further thrust selection of the Take-off/Go Around (TOGA) is availablle. AMC 25-13 defines derated thrust as a take-off thrust less than the maximum take-off thrust, for which exists in the AFM a set of separate and independent, or clearly distinguishable, take-off limitations and performance data that complies with all the take-off requirements of CS-25. When operating with a derated take-off thrust, the value of the thrust setting parameter, which establishes thrust for take-off, is presented in the AFM and is considered a normal take-off operating limit. A derated thrust take-off is considered to be a normal take-off and therefore can be carried out both on dry runwaysand on wet and contaminated runways, subject to the AFM data and other operating restrictions. Because the take-off speeds are calculated at the lower thrust, the derated thrust setting is considered to be a limit and therefore full thrust or TOGA thrust cannot be selected, even in an emergency, until the hazard area for VMCG is well passed. Airbus, for instance, does not allow TOGA to be selected on a derated take-off, until the aircraft has achieved the minimum flap retraction speed.",

When turning from base onto final approach, the shifting wind will cause a change in the groundspeed first. As the same IAS is being flown, going from a crosswind to a headwind, the groundspeed is lower on final than it was on base. As approaches require a constant angle of descent, therefore, the aircraft will have to change it's rate of descent to maintain the same approach angle (usually 3º). If the aircraft did not change rate of descent, it will descend at the same amount of feet per minute, but take longer than expected to reach the Runway, so would get low on profile. The rate of descent on an approach is directly proportional to the groundspeed (for a 3º glidepath, the rate of descent [ft/min] is the GS [kt] x 5), and therefore a reduction in groundspeed requires a reduction in the rate of descent (the pilot must decrease the vertical speed). Note that the flaps are not required to modify the rate of descent here. The flaps are used to allow us to fly slower during the descent, approach and landing, and increase drag which can be useful to help us descend, but in this scenario, there is no change to IAS or need for greater drag, so the flap setting does not need to change on this final turn, and if it did, the flaps would cause a change to the aircraft's behaviour (a balloon effect), but would not require a change to the A/T settings.",

SPECIFIC RANGE Specific Range (SR) is one of the measures of efficiency for an aircraft, as it is the distance the aircraft can fly per unit of fuel used (higher is better). The easiest formula for it is: Specific Range = TAS/Fuel Flow The optimum speed for maximum SR is when the TAS is the highest for the lowest fuel flow. As a general rule, the fuel flow of an engine is approximately proportional to the power. Therefore, the SR is highest when TAS is highest for the least power required. This point occurs at VMD for a propeller aircraft, as seen on the graph in the first annex above. As the aircraft becomes lighter, less lift is required to overcome the weight, so the lift induced drag section of the drag curve reduces. This brings the total drag curve down and to the left of the graph, so there is less drag overall (higher SR) and the point of highest SR (VMD) occurs at a slightly lower speed. The graph is usually IAS vs power required, but in this comparison it is fine to use TAS. Also, the graph looks very similar for a jet aircraft, but uses 1.32 x VMD for the point of highest SR. The second annex above shows how weight affects an aircraft's drag (and power required) curve.",

            "explanation": "Note: This question is very poorly written. When both engines rotate \"outwards\", both engines have a worse effect in the event of an engine failure than if they rotated \"inwards\". This does not, however, mean they are both critical. A critical engine is one which has a worse effect than the other in the event of an engine failure, so both engines cannot be critical. Nonetheless, we have chosen the option that \"both engines are critical\" as they both have the worst case thrust asymmetry if an engine fails, and the other options were not correct at all. The critical engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing propeller-driven aircraft is the one whose failure would result in the most adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance. When one of the engines on a typical multi-engine aircraft becomes inoperative, a thrust asymmetry exists. The thrust asymmetry can be different, depending on how the engine is mounted. Particularly on a propeller aircraft, the propellers are subject to the asymmetric blade effect, called P-factor. This occurs because the propeller does not spin perpendicular to the airflow, as the aircraft is flying with an angle of attack. This means that the down-going blades on the propeller have a higher angle of attack and longer track, so they produce more thrust. Therefore, the thrust vector of the engine is located not centrally, but more towards the down-going blade side. The annex above shows an aircraft with both engine rotating to the right. This means that one engine has its thrust vector further from the aircraft's longitudinal axis, and therefore if the other engine fails, it has a worse effect on yaw. This engine (with the worst effect on yaw) is called the critical engine. In the case of this question though, both engines have their thrust vector further from the longitudinal axis, so the aircraft has a worse response from either engine failing. In this question, none of the engines have a P-factor closest to the cockpit. That option is not quite correct in its current form.",

            "explanation": "Best Angle of climb speed (VX) is found at the maximum excess of Thrust – in other words, where the gap between the “Thrust” available and Thrust Required “Drag” curves is the greatest. Weight has a very pronounced effect on aircraft performance. If weight is added to an aircraft, it must fly at a higher AOA to maintain a given altitude and speed. This increases the induced drag of the wings, as well as the parasite drag of the aircraft. Increased drag means that additional thrust is needed to overcome it, which in turn means that less reserve thrust is available for climbing. This moves the Total Drag curve up, but also to the right. Thrust Required is increased and VX is a faster IAS. Best Rate of climb speed (VY) is found at the maximum excess of Power – in other words, where the gap between the “Power” available and Power Required curves is the greatest. As weight increases, the power required curve moves up and to the right. As a result, less excess Power is available and, therefore, the rate of climb decreases. However, as you can see, the speed for maximum Excess Power available is higher. Summary: higher Weight => decreased rate of climb => increased VY speed.",

Please let us know if you see this question in your exam, thank you. Engine performance relies very heavily on air density. The higher the density of air, the more air that can be mixed with fuel and burnt, creating more power. Higher density = higher performance. The conditions which cause air density to reduce (lower performance) are: High pressure altitude (low air pressure). High temperature High humidity In other words, hot, high and humid are bad for performance. An increase in humidity will therefore cause a reduction in density. This will reduce the amount of air available for both types of engine to combust, restricting engine power and decreasing derformance by a similar proportion in both engine types. This is different to a temperature increase, which would have a larger effect on a turbine engine, as not only would the air density be lower, but jet engines quickly become temperature limited so they do not go over the maximum TGT (Turbine Gas Temperature), and their thrust output is therefore further reduced by hot temperatures.",

Whatever happens, as the aircraft continues to climb, the actual airspeed is unknown whilst the indicated airspeed (IAS) is showing a continuous increase. This is particularly dangerous in modes such as level change or flight level change, which maintain a constant airspeed/Mach No. in the climb, as the aircraft would pitch up more and more to try to reduce the \"increasing airspeed\", stalling the aircraft quite quickly. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

There are different types of performance categorisation. Measured Performance is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. It utilises new aeroplanes and the test pilots, and is therefore not representative of the actual performance that any single aircraft might be able to achieve in normal circumstances, flown by a normal pilot. Gross Performance is the expected fleet average of aeroplanes, given that they are sufficiently maintained and flown as per the techniques detailed in the flight manuals, by a normal pilot. This means that any aircraft in the fleet has a 50% chance of exceeding this performance, but also a 50% chance of not meeting this performance. Net Performance is the gross performance, reduced by the safety margin, to account for various possibilities that could commonly cause reduced performance, such as variations in pilot technique, below-average aircraft performance, etc. The safety margin is set so that the chance of an aircraft not meeting the net performance level is extremely low. The safety margin is not fixed, It depends on the likelihood of the situation occurring, and is set to make sure that the total probability of an incident or accident occurring is at least lower than 1 in 1 million, when a passenger buys their ticket (known as their “remote probability”). This might mean that the safety margin (between gross and net performance) is large for likely events such as a take-off with all engines operating, but the safety margin is very low or even zero for unlikely events such as an engine failure at V1.",

The specific ground range (SGR) is affected, because it depends on nm/kg fuel or groundspeed/fuel flow. A headwind reduces the SGR, while a tailwind increases the SGR. Considering SGR with a headwind, the tangent starts to the right of the graph origin by the amount of the wind strength. The example above is for a 100 kt headwind. However, the tangent to the drag curve now occurs at a speed faster than 1.32 VMD, but the speed increment is less than the wind strength. By flying at this slightly faster speed, the SGR is maximum for the given headwind conditions, although still less (worse) than in still air. This occurs because for every minute the aeroplane is in a headwind, the wind is pushing it backward. Therefore, the shorter the time exposed to the wind, the shorter the distance it is pushed back.",

We have not been told whether the aircraft is multi-engine or single-engine, but neither is having a good day. In a multi, the procedure is called a drift-down, and is effectively the aircraft losing height as slowly as possible (with the remaining engine(s) running at max continuous thrust), until the aircraft gets low enough to be able to maintain height on the working engine(s). In a single, it is just gliding to the safest place possible. Nonetheless, in both scenarios we want to extend our glide or drift-down range as far as possible. In this case, we would like a tailwind, which can carry us further away from the mountains, and we should fly as close to minimum drag speed as possible. Minimum drag speed (VMD) is the best glide range speed in both a jet and a prop (it doesn't matter what engine they have if it isn't working), and is going to provide a far better glide ratio that going at nearly VMO, which means having a huge amount of drag, and a very steep glide angle.",

This is where it can get a little complicated, as drag graphs are often created with IAS on the X-axis, for easy usage at all altitudes, but Power = Thrust x True Airspeed. This means that for the same thrust required (drag), an increase in altitude causes a higher TAS and therefore a higher power required. There we have it then; for increased altitude, the power required curve will look almost the same, but for each point on the curve (which is a certain IAS), the TAS will be higher (so the curve moves to the right) and therefore the power required will also be higher (so the graph moves upwards).

Rate of descent depends on both the angle of descent and the speed down the flight path. The attached graph shows that there is greater excess drag at high speed than at low speeds. The shallowest angle of descent is achieved by staying slow. This means, that the slower speed requires a lower rate of descent to maintain the same descent path. V/S AUTOPILOT MODE Vertical Speed is an autopilot flight guidance vertical mode. In this mode, the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMCG) pitch mode guides the aircraft to the target V/S. The corresponding thrust mode is SPEED or MACH. The increase in drag associated with flap deflection requires an increased power setting in order to maintain a given airspeed and attitude, or a steady rate of descent. In conclusion: Using the V/S autopilot mode means that the autopilot is keeping a constant rate of descent. By slowing down, the vertical speed becomes excessive and the pilot must reduce the vertical speed to maintain a constant descent path. After slowing down to the approach speed, the added drag from the configuration will demand more power/thrust from the engines to keep the airspeed constant.",

For a given runway length and airplane weight, selecting a greater flap setting will increase the lift coefficient, which reduces the stalling speed. As a consequence, the take-off speeds are reduced (the same lift will be created at smaller air speed due to greater lift coefficient). This will reduce the take-off run. Flap extension during landings provides several advantages by: producing greater lift and permitting lower landing speed; producing greater drag, permitting a steep descent angle without airspeed increase. => Reducing the length of the landing roll. The down side of the use of flaps is that it generates more parasite drag: We get our best angle of climb and, therefore, our best gradient where there is the biggest gap between the thrust available and thrust required. The parasite drag from the extended flap closes the gap and the climb angle and climb gradient will reduce => go around performance is deteriorated. Hence as soon as we can after take off we accelerate and retract the flap and climb clean. Thus, we can conclude that the best climb gradient will be achieved using the least amount of flaps.",

In order for the aircraft to maintain speed and be in a steady descent, the forward component of weight must be increased to balance the Drag. This is achieved by lowering the nose (increasing descent angle y) until this component of weight increases providing enough forward force to balance the drag. At this point, the backward and forward forces are balanced. Drag (D) is balanced by the Thrust (T) and Weight component (W sin y) - \"y\" being the angle of descent. Resulting on the following equation: D = T + W sin y In this case, Descent angle = 3. Therefore, balance is represented: D = T + W sin 3",

Glide angle (and glide range) itself is independent of aircraft mass - provided the aircraft glides at VMD, since it is the lift over drag (L/D) ratio that determines the gliding range and it is unchanged with mass. However, a Speed faster or slower than VMD will lead to steeper glide angles. Glide angle = CD / CL GLIDING DISTANCE Wind speed is an important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased as a result of the increased groundspeed. Whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. GLIDING TIME The aircraft's mass varies the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio (higher VMD) => Glide duration will be decreased. If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so. SUMMARY: Glide Distance (Varies with wind) => Tailwind increases glide distance => Headwind decreases glide distance Glide Duration (Varies with mass) => Low mass increases glide duration => High mass decreases glide duration",

We suggest that you take a look at the attached figure (which can be found on CAP698, figure 4.9), where slope/wind V1 adjustment table is given. A downslope (for instance, -2%) => results in a V1 reduction; An upslope (for instance, 2%) => results in a V1 increase. Considering the above: When calculating the Accelerated Stop Distance Required, it is assumed that the engines will fail at V1. According to regulation, 2 seconds of pilot reaction are added before the operating engine is set to IDLE thrust and maximum braking applied. The distance required to bring the aircraft to a complete stop will depend (not solely) on the aircraft's speed and mass. Meaning that, at a higher V1 (higher speed from which braking is applied), the stopping distance will be increased (when comparing to a lower V1). The overall ASDR (Accelarated Stop Distance Required) is increased for a higher V1. Consequently, an upslope runway will increase ASDR.",

Unfortunately, the question does not mention this. We will assume that they are asking about jet engines, but please do tell us in the comments or by email (info@atplquestions.com) if this is the same if you see it in the exam. It may be worth commenting on this in the exam (if available) or appealing if you get it wrong, as it is misleading. Engine efficiency can be measured by a value called the Specific Fuel Consumption. This value tells us how much fuel the engine burns per unit of thrust produced. As we want low fuel burn for high thrust, the lower the SFC, the better. The calculation for SFC is via the formula: SFC = Fuel Flow/Thrust The way to make the SFC lower (more efficient) is by operating the engine in cold temperatures, and at high RPM. The cold temperatures bit of the answer is therefore very simple. However, the best altitude (low or high) requires another step. Above we mentioned that the engine like to run at high RPM to improve SFC. This is the same at all altitudes, but the problem is that the engines are far too powerful to run high RPM at low altitudes, and would quickly cause most jets to overspeed, or just run at very high drag speeds. Therefore, we want to fly at high altitudes, where the high RPM of the engines produces the correct amount of thrust for us to fly at a reasonable cruising speed, with lower drag, and better range (This also coincides with colder temperatures, which are good for SFC). Technically, this doesn't change the SFC much, but practically, it makes a huge difference to our overall efficiency, and our range.",

Glide angle and Glide range are independent of aircraft mass, provided that the aircraft glides at VMD, since it is the lift over drag (L/D) ratio that determines the gliding range and it is unchanged with mass. Flying at a Speed faster or slower than VMD will lead to steeper glide angles. The aircraft mass will, however, affect the rate of descent. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide path (higher VMD). A higher mass will give an increased forward component of weight and the aircraft will accelerate towards the resultant higher VMD. Rate of Descent (ft/min) = Gradient of Descent x TAS (VMD) Maintaining the same Gradient of Descent with a higher airspeed, ROD also increases. If two aircraft have the same L/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. However, both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.",

Consequently, the right hand side of the power curve lifts up and VY decreases ( “If flying at VMC, you should be able to maintain heading and altitude with no more than 5° bank. “ Incorrect. VMC is the calibrated airspeed, at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the aeroplane with that engine still inoperative, and maintain straight flight with an angle of bank not more than 5º. It does not mention anything about maintaining altitude. “VMC increases with altitude” Incorrect. If asymmetric thrust is high, VMC will be high. Asymmetric thrust is higher at low altitudes, therefore VMC would be expected to decrease with altitude. “Service ceiling remains the same” Incorrect. An engine failure will result in loss of thrust from the failed engine. Parasite drag will also increase – from the rudder and the windmilling engine. The total loss of thrust can be as much as 80%, if we account for the extra drag which needs to be opposed. Based on the above, we can immediately exclude one of the options => The Service ceiling will not remain the same, it will reduce.",

SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) There are two types of specific range, specific air range (SAR) and specific ground range (SGR). Specific air range is the distance through the air covered per unit of fuel burnt, while SGR is the ground distance per unit of fuel. The difference is due to wind, in the same way that groundspeed is just true airspeed plus/minus wind. As per the above learning objective, in the exam, and throughout the ATPLs, consider specific range (SR) to be SAR if not otherwise told. Typically this is expressed in nautical miles per pound/kg of fuel Specific Air Range = distance (nm) / fuel burnt (kg) Dividing both distance and fuel burnt by time: Specific Air Range (nm) = TAS/Fuel Flow",

But the climb rate will be the same. Therefore, if you're climbing at the same rate, but moving forward at a slower rate, the angle will be steeper. It means you will reach a specific altitude in the same time interval, but your ground distance will be affected. In the case of a Headwind, your ground distance will be reduced.

Please inform us if you encounter this question in your 032 Performance exam. The airframe may become contaminated by ice, frost or water either whilst it is in flight or when standing on the ground. HEAVY RAIN Heavy rain has the following effects on aeroplane performance: - The impingement and rapid accumulation of water sufficiently distorts the shape of the upper wing surface and diminishes the total lift by up to 30% of its normal value. - The impact of the rain on an aeroplane in the landing configuration decreases the aircraft’s forward speed. - When operating in such conditions a jet engine is slow to respond to rapid demands for thrust. - The mass of the rain can increase the aircraft mass momentarily. The total effect of these factors for any aeroplane experiencing such weather conditions is to produce a much lower level of performance. The mass increase raises the stalling speed, whilst the reduced lift and increased drag together reduce the forward speed achieved. An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards.",

Because the Mach number is TAS divided by LSS, this means in turn that at altitude, your Mach number is higher for a given CAS, than it is at low level. The result of this is that, as you climb, the maximum speed is controlled at low level by CAS and VMO, and at altitude you reach your limiting Mach number MMO, before you reach VMO and therefore your maximum speed is controlled by MMO. In the descent the reverse is true. Your maximum speed is controlled by MMO first, and then by VMO at lower altitudes. Alternatively, LSS increases during the descent, due to the rising temperature. Therefore, TAS must increase during descent to maintain constant Mach No. IAS is also increasing and will eventually reach its limit. VMO (\"max operating\") is the term for the maximum certified IAS. NOTE: You can also advice the ECTM lines to show that IAS increases with constant Mach.",

After an engine failure, the thrust available by the remaining engine will be less than the All-Engines-Operating thrust. Thus, the excess thrust will be also less, with the drag constant because of the feathered position of the propeller of the failed engine and as a consequence the Climb angle will decrease. For a multi-engined piston aeroplane, the Single-Engine VX (VXSE) is likely to be higher than VX. There are several graphical explanations for this increase, that in order to be valid depend on knowing the exact shape of the piston-engine thrust and drag curves, and both of these are extremely hard to find, because piston engine thrust is not easily measured.",

If no correction to thrust are made, and the pilot uses a \"still air\" setting, the headwind reduces the groundspeed and the previously calculated still air rate of descent will cause you to descend below the glideslope. Keep in mind the formula for target rate of descent on a 3° glideslope: ROD = 5 x groundspeed. For example, if IAS on final equals 120 kt, the still air groundspeed on final is 120 kt, and the required rate of descent = 5 x 120 = 600 ft/min. Now, if the pilot experiences a headwind of 20 kt, the IAS will equal 120 kt, the groundspeed will be 100 kt, and consequently the required rate of descent = 5 x 100 = 500 ft/min A rate of descent of 500 ft/min requires more thrust/power applied than a 600 ft/min ROD. Therefore, more thrust is required on final with a headwind. The next step is to understand whether the ground path will increase or descrease. If the pilot makes the thrust and rate of descent correction the distance on final will be the same, delivering you to the touchdown point. We can only imagine that EASA is referring to what would happen if the pilot did not correct thrust and ROD for the headwind. In which case, the 600 ft/min, in the above example, would have you land short and cause you to cover a reduced ground distance.",

Unlike range, endurance is not affected by the wind conditions, since it is only affected by the airspeed selection and amount of usable fuel onboard.

Please let us know if you see this question in any exams, thank you. During flight, an aircraft will experience two types of drag: - Parasite Drag (proportional to IAS2, increases with increasing “Parasite Area”: flaps, undercarriage or speed brakes) - Induced Drag (inversely proportional to IAS2, increases with increasing weight). The sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag is the Total Drag. The Total Drag will be minimum at the indicated airspeed where Parasite Drag = Induced Drag. This speed is called Minimum Drag Speed (VMD). At speeds below VMD, the Induced Drag is greater than the Parasite Drag. This is known as the \"speed unstable\" region, as any reduction in airspeed causes an increase in drag, consequently slowing the aircraft down further, causing more drag, and so on. The opposite is true for a speed increase in this region, reducing drag and allowing the aircraft to speed up even more. Speeds above VMD are \"speed stable\", as a temporary increase in airspeed causes an increase in drag, which returns the aircraft back to the equilibrium speed. In this \"speed stable\" region, the parasite drag is greater than the induced drag.",

We have not been told whether the aircraft is multi-engine or single-engine, but neither is having a good day. In a multi, the procedure is called a drift-down, and is effectively the aircraft losing height as slowly as possible (with the remaining engine(s) running at max continuous thrust), until the aircraft gets low enough to be able to maintain height on the working engine(s). In a single, it is just gliding to the safest place possible. Nonetheless, in both scenarios we want to extend our glide or drift-down range as far as possible. In this case, we would like a tailwind, which can carry us further away from the mountains, and we should fly as close to minimum drag speed as possible. Minimum drag speed (VMD) is the best glide range speed in both a jet and a prop (it doesn't matter what engine they have if it isn't working), and is going to provide a far better glide ratio that going at VMO, the maximum operating speed, which means having a huge amount of drag, and a very steep glide angle.

The minimum power required is produced when the aircraft is flying with the minimum power required speed (VMP), which exists at the lowest point of the power required curve. For a propeller-driven aircraft, VMP is also the best endurance speed, which gives the minimum power required to maintain level flight and is the point where the product of speed and drag (DRAG x TAS) are at a minimum. Any increase or decrease of the TAS above or below the VMP correspondingly, increases the power required and as a result the fuel flow and decreases the aircraft’s endurance.",
