            "explanation": "Sweep Angle: The angle between the line of 25% chords and a perpendicular to the root chord. Purpose of Sweepback: To increase MCRIT. Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

With increasing altitude, pressure continues to fall. This causes density to reduce with increasing altitude. IAS is a measurement of dynamic pressure. Dynamic pressure = 1/2 p V2, where V equals TAS. With a decreasing density (p) and constant TAS, IAS decreases. Now let's take a look at the lift formula: L = 1/2 p V2 S CL A decrease in IAS, with all remaining variables being the same would result in a decrease in lift.

Within the boundary layer, the laminar layer is the thinnest and generates the least friction. However, as this laminar layer progresses toward the transition point, it transitions into the turbulent layer. This turbulent layer is thicker and contributes to higher friction drag. To enhance aerodynamic performance, certain aerofoils are engineered to delay this transition, allowing it to occur further downstream. This strategy increases the extent of laminar flow, reducing overall friction drag. For instance, vortex generators may be used to extend the laminar flow by energizing the boundary layer and creating turbulent flow, which does cause more drag indeed, but that's how separation is delayed which is actually more important when you look at the big picture. Vortex generators are located on the upper surface of a wing to create a slightly disturbed airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing. The higher energy level delays the boundary layer separation (resulting in an extended laminar flow section), which reduces the stall speed.",

            "explanation": "An airplane flying at low, subsonic, speeds causes air-pressure changes because of its movement but they are relatively small. It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic.",

It represents the maximum speed where no part of the wing goes supersonic, especially where airflow accelerates most over the wing's upper surface. This acceleration is linked to the wing's curvature, or camber. When the angle of attack (AoA) increases, airflow over the wing's upper surface speeds up even more. Thus, a higher angle of attack leads to a lower MCRIT because sonic speed is reached at a slower flying speed. Imagine two planes flying at the same constant speed at level flight (n = 1), one heavier than the other. The heavier plane needs increase its angle of attack to generate enough lift to stay up because it's heavier. As the angle of attack increases, the air above the heavier plane's wing speeds up more, even though both planes are flying at the same IAS. The heavier one would hit the speed of sound over its wings before the lighter one, even if they had the same IAS. This happens because the heavier plane needs to have a higher angle of attack to stay at the same speed, which means it's already pushing the air faster over its wings. Thus, owing to the increased angle of attack needed to sustain flight at a given IAS, the heavier aircraft demonstrates a lower MCRIT compared to the lighter one.",

This is caused by the formation of shock waves, which adversely affect the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. As stated above, the Local Speed of Sound (LSS) is solely dependent on the Air Temperature. After the shockwave, the temperature increases and, therefore, the LSS also increases.",

            "explanation": "Mach trim is used to trim the aircraft at high Mach numbers (e.g. B737 from Mach.615). It prevents instability and tuck under (which appears above MCRIT) due to an increased pitch down moment, which is caused the following reasons: CP moves aft shock waves at the wing root reduced effectiveness of the tailplane Mach trim counteracts (increases pitch up) by one of the following: adjusting stabilizer adjusting elevator trim tank (fuel pumped to the tail) Outcome: stick force gradient will be maintained longitudinal stability will be increased tuck under will be avoided Mach Trim System relates to the pitch channel of the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS). It is designed as an AFCS sub-system and is therefore, like the yaw damper, operational irrespective of whether or not the AFCS is active (autopilot engaged or disengaged). The heart of the Mach trim system is the coupler unit. This receives signals, corresponding to Mach number, from the Air Data Computer (ADC). Whenever these signals exceed the pre-set value (for the aeroplane type) the trim coupler unit releases the brake and the speed signal from the ADC is fed to the motor. This causes the stabiliser to move in such a way that the elevators are driven upward, counteracting any tendency to a \"Mach Tuck-under\". Internal monitoring of the system provides a failure warning in the form of the illumination of a fail indicator light. Although connected to the pitch channel the system is totally independent of the pitch control channel of the AFCS. In other words, the Mach trim system provides speed stability at higher Mach numbers. It operates (adjusts the elevators with respect to the stabilizer as speed increases) only above certain minimum Mach number - for example on a B737-300 it is above Mach 0.615. With the Mach trim system INOP the maximum speed of the aircraft is typically limited to a lower Mach number than normally. \"Tuck-under\" is the phenomena encountered by aeroplanes flying at high subsonic, transonic or supersonic speeds. In these speed regimes there is typically a significant rearward movement of the Centre of Pressure (CP). In order to prevent this becoming an uncontrollable \"nose-down\" pitching motion, it is necessary to provide some form of compensation. This is done by the use of a Mach Trim System. Or otherwise said the Mach trim system allows to increase the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft by changing the horizontal stabilizer according to the Mach number.",

When the airflow around the airfoil starts reaching supersonic speed (this can happen before the aircraft flies at Mach 1 speed), small shockwave forms over the upper side of the wing, generating a large amount of lift. If speed increases, this shockwave will move backwards to the mid chord position, causing the CP to move backwards.

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

For the example shown, the maximum effective deflection of the elevator is not capable of trimming the airplane at CLMAX for CG positions ahead of 18 percent MAC. This control requirement can be most critical for an airplane in supersonic flight. Supersonic flight is usually accompanied by large increases in static longitudinal stability (due to aft CP movement) and a reduction in the effectiveness of control surfaces. To cope with these trends, powerful all-moving surfaces must be used to attain limit load factor or maximum usable CL in supersonic flight. This requirement is so important that once satisfied, the supersonic configuration usually has sufficient longitudinal control power for all other conditions of flight. Note: When supersonic flight is being discussed, both the aerodynamic center (AC) and the center of pressure (CP) of a wing tend to shift towards the midpoint of the wing, which is typically around 50% of the chord.",

The pilot transitions to a constant Mach number (M 0.72) and, in order to do so, adjusts the aircraft's pitch attitude. Initially, the aircraft pitches up to maintain the constant Mach number, its calibrated airspeed (CAS) reduces. This reduction in CAS leads to a decrease in kinetic energy (associated with forward speed). However, the potential energy (associated with altitude) increases due to the upward climb. This shift from kinetic to potential energy contributes to the increased rate of climb, all while adhering to the requested constant Mach number.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The point of maximum thickness should be aft to smooth the pressure distribution. Low camber. The mean camber line should be shaped to help minimize the local velocity peaks. If supersonic flight is a possibility the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag. SUMMARY: In supersonic flight the streamline curvatures are small and the requirement is for slender, indeed sharp, leading edges for the inlet in order to reduce the pressure drag associated with bluntness-induced shock detachment. MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given greater acceleration. Its speed will then reach M=1 at a lower speed. Increasing leading edge radius gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which gives greater airflow acceleration.",

Please send further feedback if you see this in the exam, either in the comments or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. The differences between conventional (low mounted) horizontal stabilisers and T-Tail (high mounted) horizontal stabilisers are many. Other than the increased efficiencies of the T-Tail, one of the primary differences is that it is not in the wake of the main wing during normal flight. They can be in the wake of the main wing at the stall though, causing a potentially unrecoverable deep stall. At normal flying speeds, the pitch angle of the aircraft to maintain level flight is such that the T-Tail is far above the wake of the main wing, so when in the transonic speed range, the reducing downwash of the main wing will not really affect the tailplane, as it would do a conventional tailplane. So for this question, we believe that the downwash will not change by a noticeable amount, and there will be little to no buffet on the horizontal stabiliser, due to its distance from the wake of the man wing. We must remember that the main wing is the first place on the aircraft that forms a shockwave, so the separation will cause the main wing to have a turbulent wake. This is what we believe the examiner is asking about, not when the tailplane itself forms a shockwave.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. Thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Deflecting a control surface upward decreases camber, this will arrest the aft movement of the shockwave (or, in fact, move it slightly forward) due to the increase in MCRIT.",

If you encounter this question in your official exam, please let us know. Our team is currently working on the figure for this explanation. Thank you for your patience. High-speed aerofoil sections are typically thin and sharp, while slow-speed designs have rounder leading edges and more camber. The attached graph compares a typical high-speed section with a general-purpose low-speed aerofoil. To generate the necessary lift in their respective speed regimes, these two aerofoils have different CL (coefficient of lift) requirements. The low-speed aerofoil is designed with greater thickness and camber to achieve a higher CL, enabling it to produce sufficient lift at lower speeds. Conversely, the high-speed aerofoil is much thinner and less cambered, resulting in a smaller CL. However, this reduced CL is compensated by the higher IAS (indicated airspeed) at which the high-speed aerofoil usually operates. A high speed aerofoil: Tens to have less camber, so the CL/Alpha line is below that fo a slow speed aerofoil. Tends to be thinner, so the critical angle is significantly smaller. The thinner aerofoil also has a significantly lower CLMAX.",

Effect on Mach Number of Climbing at a Constant IAS: - Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, so the speed of sound will decrease as altitude is increased. - If altitude is increased at a constant IAS, the TAS increases. - Therefore, the Mach number will increase if altitude is increased at a constant IAS. This is because TAS gets bigger and LSS gets smaller. As the climb continues, an altitude will be reached at which the flight crew must stop flying at a constant IAS and fly at a constant Mach number, to avoid accidentally exceeding MMO.",

Aircraft certified under CS-25 (and some aircraft under CS-23) are given maximum flight speeds as a VMO and MMO (maximum operating airspeed/Mach No.). Depending on the altitude and air temperature, one of these will correspond to a lower airspeed than the other. That one will be the most limiting. The MMO is most limiting at high altitudes, which is when it is most useful for us to refer to our speed in Mach No., whereas at lower altitudes, the VMO is most limiting, and we should use IAS/CAS instead. The point where this crossover happens is called the crossover altitude. A common altitude for this is around 28000 ft, but it depends on the aircraft and conditions. If descending at a constant mach number, the Mach number will not exceed the MMO (as it is constant), but using the ECTM graph above, we can see that the IAS will be increasing, and therefore the IAS may well reach and exceed VMO if the crossover is delayed to a lower altitude. The other two options \"shock stall speed\" and \"never exceed speed\" can be discounted here, as aircraft with VMO/MMO do not have a VNE and the shock stall speed occurs based on the Mach No. and MMO, both of which we know remain constant (and it is not a limiting speed as such).",

In the constant IAS phase of the climb, density (rho) is decreasing and V is increasing which maintains dynamic pressure at a constant. Therefore, there is no change in CL.

At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root.

Shock wave formation increases the adverse pressure gradient so the loss of kinetic energy in the boundary layer will be greater. Increasing the kinetic energy of the boundary layer will reduce flow separation. Simple devices called vortex generators are used to re-energize the boundary layer. Vortex generators are small plates, vanes, blades, or wedges mounted in spanwise rows along the wing surface. Each vortex generator produces a vortex at its tip which will induce high energy air from the free stream flow to mix with the boundary layer, thus increasing its kinetic energy and helping it flow through the shock wave with much less separation. Vortex generators are usually located on the upper wing surface, particularly ahead of control surfaces, but may be used anywhere where separation is causing high drag or reduced control effectiveness. It should be noted that vortex generators may also be used on subsonic aircraft to prevent separation caused by high adverse pressure gradients due to the contours of the surface.",

            "explanation": "When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. Above MCRIT, the air flowing over the top of the wing becomes supersonic, and at the point at which the air wants to decelerate back below Mach 1.0, a shockwave is formed. This shockwaves is a very thin surface where the characteristics of the air change dramatically, and can cause some airflow separation, leading to an effect called the shock stall. There are many ways to delay MCRIT and the shock stall, one of which is to fly with a supercritical wing. A supercritical aerofoil has a much flatter top surface, which not only increases MCRIT and MDD (drag divergence)* but also creates a weaker shockwave when one is formed, just above MCRIT. The shockwaves on a supercritical aerofoil quickly move to the trailing edge, making the shock stall a much smaller effect. For civilian applications, the main benefit is the faster speed that can be flown, before drag increases due to wave drag. The higher MCRIT/MDD and ability to fly just above MCRIT with little extra drag is very useful for long range jet aeroplanes, for extra range, speed and ability to fly at higher altitudes. *MDD (drag divergence Mach number) is a speed which comes just above MCRIT, where the drag begins to increase rapidly with increase in speed. This is what we really want to make higher, and using a supercritical aerofoil does exactly that.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. In supersonic flight, the thickness ratio and leading edge radius must be small to decrease wave drag, which occurs due to the formation of shockwaves at certain critical points on the aircraft's surface. A thinner wing with a smaller leading edge radius will produce smaller shockwaves and thus less wave drag.",

Thin aerofoils will generate less acceleration over the upper surface, so Mcrit will occur at higher speeds. There are various ways to increase the critical Mach number MCRIT. All of them involve doing something to change the flow on the upper surface. For example: Decrease the leading edge radius, which slows the air down. Decrease the thickness to chord ratio, which slows the air down. Sweep back, which effectively reduces the thickness to chord ratio, as far as the air molecules are concerned, so slows the air down. Vortex generators, which bring in air from outside the boundary layer delaying the onset of the critical Mach number and pushing the shockwave formation further back. Supercritical wing, which has a flatter upper surface so the air is not accelerated so much and pushes the shockwave formation further back. As far as the first example, decreasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thinner, less rounded leading edge, which reduces the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT increases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given lower acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a higher aircraft speed.",

If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’ because it results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. In the transonic range, the ‘shock stall’ is the separation of the boundary layer from the upper surface of the wing behind a shockwave. This causes the total lift generated to decrease. Unlike the normal high-incidence angle stall, the ‘shock stall’ occurs at low angles of attack and at an unexpectedly high IAS. For swept-wing airplanes because the wing-tips stall first the airplane has a nose-up pitch tendency. The angle of attack of the high-speed shock stall decreases as the Mach number increases and CLMAX decreases in a similar manner. Because the turbulent airflow behind a shockwave results in an increased loss of lift, any large rapid increase of speed can induce a premature stall.",

These effects cause the boundary layer above the wing to be very easily disturbed, inducing flow separation behind the shockwave. This separated airflow does not produce lift and this leads to the \"shock stall\" effect that can occur at these transonic speeds. As can be seen on the diagram above, initially the shockwave and boundary layer separation occur on the upper surface of the wing, approximately half-way along, then move backwards as the speed increases. A smaller shockwave also occurs on the underside of the wing near the trailing edge at slightly higher speeds, also moving towards the trailing edge as the aircraft accelerates further. Therefore, the best option here is on the upper surface, just ahead of the trailing edge. We are sceptical about that last bit of wording, but it is certainly the only possibly correct option in our opinion.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

The first two zones are the troposphere and the stratosphere. The troposphere runs from the surface of the Earth to 36,152 feet. In the troposphere, the temperature decreases linearly with altitude at a constant rate of -1,98°C/1000 ft. The lower portion of the stratosphere is an isothermal layer where the temperature remains constant (approximately -57°C) with increasing height, and then in its upper layers the temperature increases to around 0° C at the stratopause. For the study of high speed flight we are interested in the speed at which the infinitesimally small pressure disturbances (waves) travel through the atmosphere. Pressure waves ‘propagate’ from their source, that is, each air molecule is rapidly vibrated in turn and passes on the disturbance to its neighbour. The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. The higher the temperature, the higher the speed of propagation. Therefore only possible answer can be LSS will decrease in the troposphere. Since temperature decreases with increasing altitude in the troposphere LSS would decrease with temperature as well.",

Because of the critical Mach number, it is possible that shockwaves can occur at speeds even below Mach 1. As the aircraft speeds up beyond this critical Mach number, drag increases dramatically. If the aircraft is not designed for transonic or supersonic flight, this could lead to controllability problems. The critical Mach number increases with increasing wing sweepback. Thinner airfoils also increase the value of Mcrit. The drag divergence Mach number is the Mach number at which the aerodynamic drag on an airfoil begins to increase rapidly as the Mach number increases. The drag coefficient can multiply to 10 times its size compared to its low speed value. The drag divergence Mach number is a number bigger than Mcrit and smaller than Mach 1.

            "explanation": "When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required as part of creating lift. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, for instance, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. A large factor of the MCRIT is the thickness of the aerofoil, as thicker aerofoils \"squash\" the air above the wing more, thereby speeding it up more. Therefore, thinner aerofoils are more suited to high speed flight, as they have a higher MCRIT, and also handle the transonic speed regime better in general. For this question, then, thicker aerofoils decrease the MCRIT (which is bad), and thinner aerofoils increase MCRIT (good).",

            "explanation": "An airplane flying at low, subsonic, speeds causes air-pressure changes because of its movement but they are relatively small. It is convenient, therefore, to treat the air as though it could not be compressed. However, the air-pressure changes caused by the movement of an airplane at high speed, close to the speed of sound, are considerable and cannot be ignored. The air is compressible and its effect on the airplane must be accounted for when it is travelling at high speed. An airplane moving through the air creates a pressure wave around it, which is propagated away from it in all directions simultaneously at the speed of sound. For an airplane flying at a relatively low speed, less than the speed of sound, the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane can move away from the airplane. Consequently, air-pressure, air-density, air-temperature, and air-velocity changes take place ahead of the leading edge of the wings and are a gradual process. If, however, the airplane is travelling at the speed of sound then the air-pressure wave ahead of the airplane is unable to move away from the airplane and a wave of compressed air builds up at the leading edge of the wing. This compression wave will create a discontinuity plane, where the airstream experiences the following changes: Air Temperature - Increases (due to compression) Static Pressure - Increases (due to compression) Total Pressure - Decreases (Normal shockwave suffers greater loss than an oblique shockwave) Air Density - Increases (Oblique shockwave has less compression) LSS - Increases (due to the temperature increase) Speed of Airflow - Decreases to less than Mach 1 (normal shockwave). Decreases but still above Mach 1.0 (oblique shockwave). Minimum energy loss through a normal shock wave will occur when the Mach number of the airflow in front of the shock wave is small but supersonic. The Local Speed of Sound is defined by: LSS=38.95∗√(T(K)) The speed of propagation of small pressure waves depends upon the temperature of the air ONLY. Thus, if behind a shock wave temperature increases, the LSS also increases.",

            "explanation": "EFFECTS OF SHOCKWAVE FORMATION The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. FLYING CONTROLS The deflection of a conventional hinged-flap type of control creates a force ahead of the control surface that is normally greater than that which the control surface itself produces. When there is a shockwave established on the lifting surface ahead of the control surface this is no longer the case because pressure variations cannot be transmitted forward through the shockwave. The shockwave moves slightly aft when an aileron is deflected downwards. This effectively diminishes the result of deflecting the control surface because only the airflow passing over the control surface is modified. This effect is exacerbated when the shockwave reaches the trailing edge of the aerofoil and the control effectiveness is decreased even further. In transonic flight the ailerons are less effective than in subsonic flight because aileron deflection only partially affects the pressure distribution around the wing. These characteristics have led to the substitution of the tailplane and elevator combination in high-speed aeroplanes with a fully flying horizontal stabiliser. On these aeroplanes the conventional wing-tip ailerons are replaced with differential spoilers and/or inboard ailerons that are for use when the aeroplane is flying at transonic speeds. Because of the increased input forces required from the pilot during flight at transonic speeds and the large variation of the stick forces encountered during the transition of the shockwave over the control surface, most high-speed aeroplanes are fitted with fully power-operated controls.",

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular (90 degrees), or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced.",

Students have confirmed that the option \"The airflow becomes more turbulent due to the presence of areas of Increased compressibility slowing down the speed of the airflow.\" Was not correct in exams. Please let us know if you come across this question in your examination. Thank you! As an aircraft accelerates to high speeds, it enters a regime where the effects of compressibility become significant. The critical Mach number (MCRIT) is the airspeed at which the local airflow over certain parts of the aircraft (typically near the wing's leading edge or other protuberances) reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1). The airflow over the aircraft's surfaces starts to approach or reach the speed of sound. This means that some parts of the aircraft may experience local airflow velocities at or near Mach 1. This increased compressibility is what leads to changes in the behavior of the airflow. As the airflow reaches or exceeds Mach 1 locally, shock waves can start to form. These are sudden, discontinuous changes in air pressure and density. Shock waves can form on the wings, fuselage, and other parts of the aircraft that have particular shapes or characteristics that cause local acceleration of the airflow. One of the consequences of compressibility effects is that the total pressure of the airflow increases. This increase in total pressure can lead to an artificially high reading on instruments like the airspeed indicator. CAS measures the pressure differential between the pitot tube (which senses ram air pressure) and static pressure. At high speeds, the ram air pressure component becomes significant, causing CAS to read higher than TAS.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

            "explanation": "The formation and development of shock waves on the wing have effects on lift, drag, stability and control. Many of these effects are caused by shock induced separation. As the air flows through the shock wave, the sudden rise in pressure causes the boundary layer to thicken and often to separate. This increases the depth of the turbulent wake behind the wing. As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON LIFT At low subsonic speeds the lift coefficient CL is assumed to be constant at a given angle of attack. With increasing Mach number, however, it will vary. At speeds above MCRIT a shock wave will have formed on the upper surface. This may cause boundary layer separation aft of the shock wave, causing loss of lift. Shock stall results from a separated boundary layer just as the low speed stall does. Shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value (for a given angle of attack). EFFECT OF SHOCK WAVES ON THE LIFT CURVE AND CLMAX At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4, CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 1. At a constant angle of attack, the increase of CL as speed increases from about M 0.4 into the low end of the transonic region gives a steeper lift curve slope, i.e. the change of CL per degree angle of attack will increase, as seen in figure 2. Because of earlier separation resulting from the formation of the shock wave, CLMAX and the stalling angle will be reduced.",

In aircraft which are not designed for these high speeds, that can be dangerous, as the shockwave can cause airflow separation and loss of lift behind it. However, modern high speed jet aircraft are designed with this in mind, with swept back, supercritical wings, etc. These allow the aircraft to operate just above MCRIT, with a small penalty of increased drag, in return for extra speed. This means that these aircraft often cruise with a very small shockwave on top of the wing.

            "explanation": "When an aircraft accelerates above approximately M0.4, the effects of compressibility begin to occur. The easiest way to understand this is by remembering that the aircraft produces pressure waves ahead of it (its wings in this context) which \"tell the air that the wing is coming\", so the air can begin to move out of the way. These pressure waves can only move at the speed of sound though, so as the aircraft itself starts going faster, the air gets less and less time to move away from the oncoming wing. This leads to a more aggressive uplift of air just ahead of the wing leading edge at high subsonic speeds, and this takes some energy out of the airflow (amongst some other effects). Together, these lead to a stall at lower angles of attack than usual. Therefore, when accelerating into the transonic regime, the wing's critical angle of attack (angle at which it stalls) reduces due to the compressibility effects ahead of the wing.",

This will provide better flight characteristics and lower drag in the transonic speed regime where large jets often operate. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the freestream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. This agrees with what we would expect as cos(0) = 1 and therefore the perpendicular airflow to the wing is the same as the freestream airflow when no sweep angle exists (i.e. an unswept wing) The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft.",

At high Mach numbers, an aircraft will become unstable with respect to speed; instead of an increasing push force being required as speed increases, a pull force becomes necessary to prevent the aircraft accelerating further. A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment. This unfavorable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted. It is operational at high Mach numbers in the transonic speed range.

Swept wings can be very useful for high speed flight, as the effectively lengthen the chord of the wing, so therefore decrease the thickness-to-chord ratio, effectively making the wing behave like a thinner wing and having a higher MCRIT. Swept wings do pay for this in other areas though, such as low speed flight, where they have a tendency to stall at the tips first, as well as lower lift for the same angle of attack, and less effective high lift devices. High lift devices are less effective on swept wings, take trailing edge flaps for example, simply because the hinge line is not perpendicular to the airflow, and this puts the flaps at an angle, which decreases their effectiveness. The steeper the sweep angle, the stronger this effect. Therefore, the worst wing type from these options is the one with the greatest sweepback of 25°.",

For best specific range (nautical miles per kg of fuel used) we need maximum TAS / Drag ratio. TAS can be maximised without a significant drag penalty, if we fly just above MCRIT. This is because, when Mcrit is first exceeded, the extra drag caused by the shock waves will be minimal, (especially on supercritical wings), provided that speed is kept below the drag divergence Mach number. The TAS / Drag ratio also increases, if TAS can be increased without an increase in IAS. This can be achieved by increasing altitude. So best specific range is achieved by cruising just above MCRIT, and by flying as high as other considerations permit.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less.

The area rule states that provided the cross-sectional area of the aeroplane is similar to that of the ideal shape, the wave drag of the aeroplane will be similar to that of the ideal shape, irrespective of its actual shape. Wave drag is related to the curvature of the distribution of the volume of an aeroplane. The smoother the curvature the less is the magnitude of the wave drag. Large volumes of the airframe, such as the wings, are usually positioned at the widest part of the fuselage and other necessary features such as the cockpit, the tailplane and engine intakes have to be spread out along the fuselage to maintain the cross-sectional area distribution as near perfect as possible. For transonic aeroplanes it was discovered that indenting the fuselage to produce a waist and adding more volume to the rear of the aeroplane minimised transonic wave drag. Thus, the volume of the fuselage has to be decreased wherever a projection such as the wings and tailplane are positioned so that the cross-sectional area distribution changes smoothly with no discontinuities. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘coke bottle’ effect.",

                "4) these changes start to become significant"
            ],
            "explanation": "As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Figure 1 shows that at low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases as seen in figure 2. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2∗W)/(ρ∗S∗CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 3 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under.

            "explanation": "081.02.03.01.02: Explain how a change in alpha, aeroplane weight, manoeuvres, and centre-of-gravity (CG) position influences MCRIT. When air travels over an aerofoil in normal operation, the air above the aerofoil, near the leading edge, increases in velocity, due to the \"squashing\" of the streamlines together, causing a venturi effect, creating the low pressure zone that is required. This means that air is usually going faster over the top of the wing than anywhere else on the airframe. As the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, Mach 1, the air above the wing will get there first, as it is faster than the freestream airflow (TAS). In particular, it is usually the air just above the wing root, where the wing is thickest, and the streamlines get \"squashed\" the most, that is the first bit of air to reach the sound barrier. The TAS at which the first particle of air becomes sonic (exactly Mach 1) is called MCRIT, and is the beginning of the transonic speed regime. Above this speed, shockwaves will begin to form on various parts of the airframe. MCRIT is variable, and in particular depends on the airspeed increase over the wing. If the speed increase equates to M0.2, then the aircraft will have an MCRIT of M0.8, a higher MCRIT than if the speed increase due to the wing was M0.25, giving an MCRIT of M0.75. A higher MCRIT is better, as the drag increases rapidly just above the MCRIT, at MDD, the drag divergence speed, and we would like to fly as fast as possible with the lowest drag. The higher the angle of attack of the wing, the higher the speed increase, and therefore the lower the MCRIT. This would come from anything that increases the angle of attack, such as higher weight, or a more forward CG, which acts like increased weight due to the increased downforce from the tailplane. Effectively, bad things for performance such as increased weight or forward CG, cause a bad effect, lower MCRIT, due to increased AoA. Therefore, in this question, the more aft CG will cause a reduction in lift required by the main wing, which will require a lower angle of attack (lower lift coefficient for level flight), and the speed increase over the wing would be lower, so the aircraft can fly faster before getting shockwaves forming, thus a higher MCRIT, which is good.",

It increases the cruise Mach number, the range, and the endurance of the airplane. The main features of a supercritical wing are: The upper surface is flattened but the lower surface is reflex cambered towards the trailing edge. Thus, the airflow over the upper surface is not accelerated as much as conventional airfoils, which delays the formation of the shockwave to a higher speed. Compared with a conventional airfoil section it has a larger leading-edge radius, a flatter upper surface and both positive and negative camber and enables a relatively thick wing to be used for approximately the same cruise Mach number. The curved lower surface increases the lift generated by the aft end of the airfoil and replaces some of the lift lost from the flat upper surface. Because of the rear-loaded lift generation it is often called an aft-loaded wing. The leading edge of the supercritical wing has a greater radius than traditional airfoils that suffer from excessive wave drag and the loss of longitudinal stability (tuck under). By ensuring that its profile is carefully designed any expansion waves will be reflected from the subsonic boundary back to the shockwave, thereby weakening its intensity.",

            ],
            "explanation": "LOW SPEED VS. HIGH SPEED STREAMLINE (figure 1) As an aircraft flies faster, the streamline pattern around the wing changes. Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. At low speed, the streamline pattern is affected far ahead of the wing and the air has a certain distance in which to upwash. As speed increases, the wing gets closer to its leading pressure wave, and the streamline pattern is affected a shorter distance ahead so must approach the wing at a steeper angle. EFFECT OF MACH NUMBER ON CLMAX (figure2) This change in the streamline pattern accentuates the adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge and flow separation occurs at a reduced angle of attack. Above M0.4 CLMAX decreases. The stall speed is defined by: VS=√((2 x W)/(ρ x S x CLMAX)) At the stalling angle CLMAX and S are constant, and the indicated airspeed is given by the dynamic pressure 1/2ρV2. Therefore, for the same airplane mass and configuration in straight and level flight, if the slight difference between EAS and IAS caused by compressibility is ignored, an airplane will stall at the same IAS at all altitudes. If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. STALLING SPEED vs. ALTITUDE (figure 3) At a constant EAS, Mach number increases as altitude increases. The variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

The change in drag characteristics is shown by the CD curve for a basic section at a constant angle of attack in figure 1.

However, airliners fly very close to their critical Mach number, consequently compressibility cannot be neglected anymore. In fluid mechanics, compressibility is the change of density of a fluid in response to a change in pressure (or mean stress).

Faster than about four tenths the speed of sound (M 0.4) these changes start to become significant. This phenomenon is known as compressibility. Coefficient of Lift (CL) is assumed to remain constant for a particular angle of attack at low subsonic speeds. In high subsonic speeds and the transonic speed regime, the compressibility of the air begins to take effect and, for a particular angle of attack, the coefficient of lift increases. This is because the air cannot \"feel the wing coming\" from as far away (due to it moving so fast), so has to react and get out of the way later. This is more aggressive and gains more lift from the air, but it also removes some of the energy from the air by doing this, and causes a much lower stalling angle of attack, and thereby decreases the CLMAX of the wing overall. This reduced stalling angle of attack is also what causes the low speed buffet boundary to get faster at high altitudes.",

Liquid is an incompressible fluid. A gaseous fluid such as air, on the other hand, can be either compressible or incompressible. Generally, for theoretical and experimental purposes, gases are assumed to be incompressible when they are moving at low speeds (under approximately M0.4). The motion of the object traveling through the air at such speed does not affect the density of the air. This assumption has been useful in aerodynamics when studying the behavior of air in relation to airfoils and other objects moving through the air at slower speeds. However, when aircraft began traveling faster than M0.4, assumptions regarding the air through which they flew that were true at slower speeds were no longer valid. At high speeds some of the energy of the quickly moving aircraft goes into compressing the fluid (the air) and changing its density. The air at higher altitudes where these aircraft fly also has lower density than air nearer to the Earth's surface. The airflow is now compressible, and aerodynamic theories have had to reflect this.",

This is caused by the formation of shock waves, which adversely affect the stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The overall direction of the airflow remains the same, but as it passes through the shock wave, the following changes take place: - The flow is rapidly decelerated to a subsonic Mach number. - Static pressure increases. - Temperature increases. - Density increases. - The energy of the airstream (total pressure) is greatly reduced. In fluid dynamics, the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number that describes the relative pressures throughout a flow. The increase in pressure due to the compressibility effects created by the presence of shockwaves will lead to an increase in the pressure coefficient.",

An aerofoil generates lift by accelerating air over the top surface. At small angles of attack the highest local velocity on an aircraft will usually be located at the point of maximum thickness on the wing. At increased angles of attack the local velocity will be greater and further forward. Also, if the thickness/chord ratio were greater, the local speed will be higher. Increased thickness/chord ratio and increased angle of attack cause greater accelerations over the top surface of the wing, so the Critical Mach number will decrease with increasing thickness/chord ratio or angle of attack. If we consider two aeroplanes maintaining a constant flight level and flying at the same IAS, one heavier and one lighter, the heavier aeroplane will be flying at a greater AoA in order to maintain a constant flight level. As mentioned above, a higher AofA leads to a higher airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface for the heavier aeroplane, even though both are flying at the same speed. If both aeroplanes accelerate at the same rate, the heavier aeroplane would be the first to get into a situation where the airflow over the upper surface of its wings would locally reach a sonic speed. Therefore, at the same speed, the heavier aeroplane has a lower MCRIT due to the higher AoA. In conclusion: Higher mass = lower MCRIT due to a greater AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed. Lower mass = higher MCRIT due to a smaller AoA to maintain a level flight at a given speed.",

To reduce the severity of the shock stall and allow aircraft to travel faster, some modern jet transport category aircraft have supercritical wings.",

            "explanation": "Exceeding the MCRIT speed means that the aircraft is in the transonic speed regime, and that the air going over the wing is becoming supersonic, and therefore forming a shockwave as it reduces back below supersonic speeds. The formation of the shockwave over the wing is the main focus of this question. Transonic effects do cause changes in elevator (pitch) controls due to Mach tuck, but the largest control surface change is the ailerons, as they are mounted on the main wings, and can interact quite badly with the shockwave formation. When ailerons deflect downwards, they change the camber of the wing and cause further acceleration over the wing, which increases the magnitude of the shockwave. The shockwave causes shockwave induced separation behind it on the wing, and this greatly reduces the effect that ailerons can have, as they are trailing edge devices. The worst effect occurs when the section of the wing in front of the ailerons does not yet have a shockwave, so just above MCRIT, when the wing root has formed a shockwave but the thinner section near the wing tip has not. The down-going aileron can increase the camber enough to cause an isolated shockwave in that area, and this can massively reduce the lift from that section of the wing. Of course, that is the exact opposite of the desired effect, as that wing is supposed to be the one with more lift. Therefore, you get a aileron reversal effect, where you ask the aircraft to roll left but it actually rolls to the right. As for the other options: Spoilers are affected by shockwave formation, of course, but as they tend to accelerate the air over them, the shockwave would form right at the back of the spoiler, so they would have at least mostly the desired effect. The rudder is not massively affected by shockwave effects as the fin is very thin in comparison to the wing, and therefore doesn't accelerate the air as much, so shockwaves form much later, and quite evenly on either side of the fin. Flaps should not be used at transonic speeds, for so many reasons.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

Please let us know if you see this question in the exam, what the correct answer could have been (if you can find out) and which authority you sat the exam with, thank you! When an aircraft accelerates through the transonic speed range and exceeds its Critical Mach number, a normal shock wave can form on the upper surface of the wing. This shock wave induces flow separation, causing turbulent airflow over the wing and along the fuselage. This turbulent airflow can create airframe buffet, which is felt throughout the aircraft. If the tailplane is aligned with the separated airflow, the turbulent airflow caused by the flow separation can also hit the tail of the aircraft, which may result in a change in the aerodynamic forces acting on the tail and buffet. Option a) \"up wash over the tail, causing a nose down pitching moment.\" is not correct because the flow separation on the wing does not cause upwash over the tail, but rather turbulent airflow and a slight reduction in downwash (naturally, due to the higher airspeed). There will be a nose-down pitching moment around this time, but it is due to the AC moving on the wing and the reduction in downwash, not upwash from the shockwave.",

Longitudinal stability is the most commonly affected form of stability. It is determined by movement of the centre of pressure, coupled with changes in the coefficient of lift and the amount of downwash acting on the tailplane. The nose-down pitching moment produced by the wing is counteracted by placing a small download on the tailplane. If the shock stall occurs, any lift aft of the shock wave is destroyed and the tailplane becomes covered in disturbed airflow. The downwash acting on the tailplane is consequently eliminated causing a smooth and radical change in its angle of attack. The angle of attack becomes more positive and the download acting on the tailplane becomes an upload which, in conjunction with the wing pitching moment, causes a violent nose-down pitching moment, known as tuck-under. The exact nature and strength of the changes in trim and stability depend on the design of the aircraft.",

Please put any further exam feedback in the comments or email it to info@atplquestions.com, thank you. One of the most used methods of increasing MCRIT is to sweep the wing back. As it can be considered that compared to a straight wing, a swept-back wing of the same airfoil section has a smaller effective thickness chord ratio. Sweeping the wing back increases the effective aerodynamic chord for the same dimensional thickness, so the wing acts the same as a thinner wing. The other way to consider this relationship, is that the velocity of air flowing perpendicular to the wing span will be lower than the velocity of the free stream air. In this way, the MCRIT of an aeroplane with a swept wing will be higher and the transonic drag rise will be delayed. The air velocity perpendicular to the wing span corresponds to the free stream velocity multiplied by the cosine of the sweepback angle. The sweepback angle is the angle between a straight wing (the aeroplane's lateral axis) and the 25% chord line of the swept wing. The red line on the diagram above is the free stream flow, and the blue line is the component of that which flows perpendicular to the wing span.",

Avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 NM => this general guideline applies even to jet fighters and large airliners. Hail and severe turbulence can exist well outside of the storm cloud. • If you plan to deviate around a thunderstorm => fly on the upwind side so that your path does not converge with the path of the storm. • Do not be tempted to try to fly under a thunderstorm, even if you can see through the rain on the other side => besides rain, hail and lighting, the area under a thunderstorm typically contains severe turbulence (including microbursts, windshear and downdrafts • Trying to fly over a developing storm is also dangerous => the rising clouds can usually outclimb your aircraft. “1. Descend to a lower altitude” CORRECT. The AOA of the wing has the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet, or pre-stall buffet, at either the high or low speed boundaries for the airplane. The higher the plane flies, the thinner the air and the greater the AOA required to produce the lift needed to maintain level flight. Increasing the AOA increases the speed of the airflow over the wing and the chances of Mach buffet. “4. Avoid cells by using weather radar” CORRECT. If your aircraft is equipped with a weather avoidance system, such as a weather radar, you can use it to avoid thunderstorms. You should avoid intense thunderstorms echoes by at least 20 NM. Airborne weather radar is designed for avoiding severe weather, not for penetrating it. It detects drops of precipitation. Therefore, do not try to use it to avoid instrument weather associated with clouds and fog – it does not provide any assurance of avoiding IFR weather conditions.",

As far as the first example, increasing the leading edge radius, gives the aerofoil a thicker, more rounded leading edge, which increases the airflow acceleration. The MCRIT decreases when the airflow over the upper surface of the wing is given faster acceleration and its speed will then reach M=1 at a slower aircraft speed.",

It is an indication of how fast an aircraft is travelling with relation to the sound waves that surround it. The Mach number may be calculated as follows: M = TAS / LSS LSS is determined by the formula LSS = 38.95 √ T in Kelvin. Hence, when temperature decreases, LSS also declines. With both TAS and LSS experiencing reduction, the Mach Number remains constant. Note: In terms of its impact on True Airspeed (TAS), density (ρ) holds a greater significance compared to temperature. When flying at a constant altitude through a cold air mass, only temperature influences TAS, leading to a decrease. This response aligns with the principles of general gas laws.",

The speed of sound is defined as the rate at which small pressure disturbances are propagated through the air, which is solely a function of air temperature. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOCK WAVES When aircraft fly through the air, every part of them sets up tiny pressure disturbances, which radiate outward at the speed of sound in all directions. As Mach number increases, the flow over the wing continues to accelerate and eventually reaches a sonic value at a particular point on the wing, normally the point of maximum thickness. With increasing Mach number, this point grows into an area of supersonic flow, so the air moving over the upper surface will be moving rearward faster than the pressure disturbances can move forward. These disturbances consequently pile up on each other and form a shock wave. The shock wave acts perpendicular, or normal, to the surface, and is more commonly referred to as a normal shock wave. Notably, this occurs where the flow changes from supersonic back to subsonic.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

At high Mach numbers, an aircraft will become unstable with respect to speed; instead of an increasing push force being required as speed increases, a pull force becomes necessary to prevent the aircraft accelerating further. A small increase in Mach number will give a nose-down pitch which will further increase the Mach number. This in turn leads to a further increase in the nose-down pitching moment. This unfavorable high-speed characteristic, known as “Mach Tuck”, “High Speed Tuck” or “Tuck Under” would restrict the maximum operating speed of a modern high-speed jet transport aircraft. To maintain the required stick force gradient at high Mach numbers, a Mach trim system must be fitted. It is operational at high Mach numbers in the transonic speed range. In the event of this equipment failing, the speed is limited to specified Mach number.",

In other words, it is the speed at which the local Mach number is equal to the free-airstream Mach number. It is also the highest speed possible without supersonic flow over the wing. The critical Mach number is inversely proportional to the angle of attack, i.e. MCRIT decreases with increasing angle of attack and vice versa. This is because, as the angle of attack increases the local peak velocity of the airflow over the wing also increases. It therefore reaches Mach 1 sooner than it would have done at a lower angle of attack; thus, the critical Mach number is less. At the design stage of an airplane the inclusion of some characteristics will increase the value of the critical Mach number: A thin airfoil cross-section (low thickness to chord ratio). Generally, a thicker wing with a large amount of camber has a lower critical Mach number than a thin wing with little camber because the airflow over its upper surface accelerates to a higher speed than it would over a thin wing. Therefore, an airfoil with reduced camber will have a higher MCRIT.",

            "explanation": "Short explanation As the aircraft approaches drag divergence, its increasing speed causes both the coefficient of lift (CL) and coefficient of drag (CD) to increase, with CL continuing to rise until the point of shock stall. Additionally, the shockwave moves aft as the Mach number increases. Behind the shockwave, the air density increases. The temperature rises, this results in a higher LSS behind the shockwave. Detailed explanation: An airplane does not have to be flying at the local speed of sound for the airflow over the wings to be supersonic. A normal shockwave can develop at any time the airplane is in the transonic speed range. The function of the wing is to accelerate the air passing over its upper surface. The airflow may be subsonic at the leading edge of the wing but can be accelerated to become supersonic by the trailing edge of the wing, despite the fact that the airplane is flying at a speed of less than Mach 1.0. This is transonic flight, which usually occurs between Mach 0.75 and Mach 1.2. At speeds less than Mach 0.75 all the airflow over the wing is subsonic and as the airplane accelerates the first shockwave will form on the upper surface at the wing root. When the air over the upper surface of the wing becomes sonic, a shockwave forms because the pressure waves over the rear of wing at the wing root are attempting to move forward and meet the air moving aft from the leading edge at exactly the same speed but in the opposite direction. The meeting point is usually just aft of the point of maximum camber because this is where the air over the upper surface of the wing is accelerating at the greatest rate. The meeting point of the two air-pressure waves is the shockwave and is where the airflow changes from being sonic or supersonic to become subsonic. Air passing through the shockwave experiences an increase of pressure, temperature, and density. If the airplane speed continues to increase the area of supersonic air on top of the wing spreads backward towards the trailing edge, resulting in the shockwave moving aft. As seen in figures 2 and 3, at speeds between M0.75 and drag divergence Mach number CL increases. This is due to the pressure distribution over the airfoil resulting from the aft movement of the shockwave.",

If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved: - Load factor. - Mach number. - Angle of attack. - Pressure altitude. - Weight. - CG position. Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries.",

This is because the average velocity of the air close to the surface is higher than in a laminar boundary layer, this creates more skin friction and therefore increases drag. – Incorrect! “A turbulent boundary layer turns into a laminar one at the transition point.” As we can see from the figure, the laminar boundary layer can turn into a turbulent one. This process cannot be reversed, therefore once turbulent, a layer will never return to being laminar. – Incorrect! “A laminar boundary layer is thinner than a turbulent one.” A laminar boundary layer is indeed thinner than a turbulent boundary layer, as we can see from the figure. – Correct! “Compared with a turbulent boundary layer, a laminar boundary layer is better able to resist a positive pressure gradient before it seperates.” A laminar layer cannot exist when pressure is rising in the direction of the flow. On a curved surface like an airfoil where the pressure starts increasing from the point of maximum thickness, the transition from laminar to turbulent usually occurs at the point of maximum thickness. Therefore, turbulent boundary layer is actually better at resisting a positive pressure gradient. – Incorrect!",

Further information: ICE ACCRETION The formation of ice on the surface of an aeroplane has a dramatically adverse effect on its performance. The most dangerous type of ice accretion is that which occurs when flying through cumulo-nimbus cloud or through supercooled water droplets ahead of a warm front because of its rapid accumulation. The effect that ice accretion has on an aeroplane’s performance includes: - increased mass; - decreased total lift; - decreased CLMAX (that is the most serious effect); - increased total drag; - up to 25% increased stalling speed; - reduced stalling angle; - changed aerofoil shape; - abnormal stalling characteristics. For an aeroplane in the take-off or landing configuration, ice accretion is extremely dangerous because of the close proximity of the normal operating speed to the stalling speed. Consequently, there is a very high risk of the aeroplane stalling when it is close to the ground.",

If an aerofoil encounters an upgust, it will experience an increase in angle of attack. For a given gust velocity, the increment in angle increases as the aircraft TAS decreases. If the angle of attack is already large (low speed), the increment due to the gust could cause the wing to stall. Furthermore, ice on the wings can raise the stall speed in various ways. The weight of ice adds to the aeroplane’s total weight, increasing the stall speed. Ice can change the shape of the aerofoil, either by reducing the coefficient of lift or the stalling angle of attack.

The total effect of these factors for any aeroplane experiencing such weather conditions is to produce a much lower level of performance. The mass increase raises the stalling speed, whilst the reduced lift and increased drag together reduce the forward speed achieved. An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards.",

This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices. An aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on take-off to touchdown. The intensity depends on aircraft weight, speed and configuration. The greatest wake turbulence danger is produced by large, heavy airplanes operating at low speeds, high angles of attack and in a clean configuration. Although wake turbulence settles, it persists in the air for several minutes, depending on wind conditions. In light winds of 3 to 7 knots, the vortices can stay in the touchdown area, sink into your take-off or landing path, or drift over a parallel runway => Light crosswinds may cause the vortices to drift. A 3 to 5 knot crosswind will tend to keep the upwind vortex in the runway area and may cause the downwind vortex to drift toward another runway.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

            "explanation": "\"I. The combination of a wing with sweepback and a T-tail make an aeroplane prone to deep stall.\" CORRECT. A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Aircraft with swept-back wings are prone to deep stall, regardless of horizontal stabilizer position (T-tail or low tail). T-tail will worsen recovery characteristics. Swept-forward wings at very high angle of attack are prone to deep stall as well. However, if a low horizontal tail is fitted, some pitch down moment may be produced with the help of the horizontal stabilizer since it is out of the separated turbulent wake of the wing. \"II. A stick pusher system can be fitted to an aeroplane that exhibits abnormal stall characteristics.\" CORRECT. A stick pusher is a system that will push the stick forward, lowering the nose and therefore decreasing the angle of attack to prevent a stall. Stick pushers are typically installed where the 'natural aerodynamic stall characteristics' of the aircraft are unacceptable and do not meet the regulatory requirements.",

THE EFFECT OF CONTAMINATION ON TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Any wing contamination greatly affects the take-off performance of the aircraft, with the associated increase in drag not only extending the take-off run, but also reducing the aircraft's climb performance. Any increase in the stall speed may also dangerously reduce the margin to stall on take-off, and may even reach a critical level, especially when operating in turbulent conditions. The resulting increase in aircraft drag also reduces the amount of excess thrust available at a given climb speed, thus decreasing the aircraft's angle of climb. The aircraft's rate of climb is similarly reduced. With severely contaminated wings, the pitch and roll pre-stall buffet characteristics (compared to a clean wing), may occur before the stick shaker activates.",

This speed is Mmo most of the time, sometimes it is slightly below. These speeds come closer together as altitude increases. At a certain altitude the aircraft can encounter the so called “Coffin corner”. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are very close together here, and thus it is easy to stall or hit Mmo. The coffin corner is a dangerous situation and is supposed to be avoided, as a slight amount of turbulence could cause the aircraft to stall. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor. The margins between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: - Higher aircraft weight - Higher altitude - Higher load factor - More forward CG position",

It is also the energy lost due to friction within the boundary layer. Very close to the surface, the air molecules are slowed down and brought to a standstill relative to the aircraft's surface. All this is happening just a few millimetres of the surface. The boundary layer exists in two forms: Laminar flow is the thinnest layer, smooth and produces the least friction. Turbulent flow is unsteady, thicker, the layers become mixed and as a result produces more friction drag. The laminar layer transitions to the turbulent layer at the transition point. The airflow starts off as laminar flow, the speed increases steadily from the surface to the free stream and at some point along the airfoil's surface the airflow transits into turbulent flow. The difference in drag caused by the two states of the boundary layer is very marked about the same order of magnitude as the effect of streamlining, so it's understandable that much design effort is focussed on keeping the flow laminar for as long as possible. Thus, some aerofoils are designed to delay the transition by making it occur further aft so there is a greater area of laminar flow. But such aerofoils have their disadvantges: They produce less lift, so they tend to be used on aircraft that fly at higher speeds. The separtion point tends to move forward very quickly leading to a narrow stall region.",

During climbing and descending turns the aircraft is subject to additional rolling moments resulting from the variation in each wing’s angle of attack. Although the whole aircraft covers the same altitude during a complete turn, the wings follow differing spiral paths due to the variation in turn radius. During climbing turns, an aircraft describes an upward spiral path. Thus, the relative airflow comes downward to meet the wings, thereby reducing their angles of attack and hence their coefficients of lift. The faster moving outer wing is subject to a smaller reduction in angle of attack. This makes the net coefficient of lift higher than on the inner wing, thereby producing greater lift. Its increased velocity further enhances the lifting capability of the outer wing. An aircraft in a climbing turn therefore tends to overbank more than in a steady level turn.

The air all arrives at \"freestream\" velocity, which we call the TAS, True Airspeed, but the way the streamlines of air split between top and bottom of the wing causes some to stretch away or squash towards each other, which increases or decreases the speed of the air. If you are familiar with the venturi tube, you know that air in the thin section is faster than air at the wide section, due to lower cross-sectional area. Well this happens above a wing also; the streamlines some distance above the wing remain straight (they have no idea the wing has passed beneath them), but the wing squashes the other streamlines into them, therefore creating faster airflow, and lower static pressure. Also, the opposite occurs for streamlines that get further apart: the air slows down, creating a high static pressure zone. This creates a pressure pattern around the wing, which obviously changes with the angle of attack, how the wing is presented to the airflow. Notice the low pressure zone on the top of the wing; that will get stronger and further towards the leading edge (up until the stall), as it is squeezing the air streamlines more, and the air is having to go much faster. Notice also how there is little to no pressure zone at the back, which can remain like that, or become a slight high pressure zone at high angles of attack. The air wants to flow from high to low pressure (against the direction of airflow). This means we have an \"adverse pressure gradient\". The top surface of the wing has air flowing along it, but due to the air interacting with other nearby air particles (we call this viscosity), this airflow does not reach the surface of the wing. The particles of air on the surface of the wing are stationary, and there is an increasing amount of airflow in each subsequent particle, moving away from the wing. We call this the boundary layer. The boundary layer obviously has some slow moving air, whereas the freestream air over the wing is quite fast. When an adverse pressure gradient builds up on the top surface of the wing, the particles in the boundary layer become more and more excited to flow from the high to low pressure, which means flowing backwards along the surface of the wing. This initially turns the laminar boundary layer into a turbulent one. The problem is, as soon as pressure gradient reaches a certain threshold, the particles will begin to flow backwards uncontrollably, creating vortices which separate from the wing and creates the stall (see annex above). This is compounded by the low energy of the boundary layer at high angles of attack, causing a lower speed airflow, to make stall happen at an even lower angle of attack. In terms of this question, the area covered by an adverse pressure gradient on the top of the aerofoil gets larger with increasing angle of attack, and the pressure gradient gets stronger also. The air in that area will have lower energy, and therefore lower speed due to this, eventually causing the stall, starting at the trailing edge and moving forwards to cover the whole wing upper surface.",

This alone means that the pilot usually wants to retract the flaps to a clean configuration as-soon-as-possible. How soon that is, is a bit more complicated to answer. For starters, you need a specific (safe) speed for each notch of flaps to be retracted. Stall speed will increase every time you retract a notch of flaps so you want to be well above that speed before putting your hand on the flaps lever. So, in theory, the second the wheels are off the ground, you can just level off, keep flying a few feet above ground and keep accelerating until a safe speed is reached then retract flaps all the way to a clean configuration. In this case, the flaps are retracted right after take-off, when a positive rate of climb is observed (the pilot retracts the flaps when he/she should have retracted the landing gear). At this point, the speed is likely to be slower than the stall speed for a clean configuration - the aircraft may stall.",

If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’. Shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. As the shock wave moves aft over the surface of the wing, the CP also moves aft. This aft movement combined with the reduced downwash at the tail plane due to the presence of the shockwave will lead to Tuck Under. As we can see, from all the options, only one of them occurs when operating above MCRIT (transonic speed regime) and that’s ‘Mach buffet’.",

Remember that it is possible to exceed the critical AOA at any airspeed, at any attitude, and at any power setting. Impending Stall—an impending stall occurs when the AOA causes a stall warning, but has not yet reached the critical AOA. Indications of an impending stall can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning. Full Stall—a full stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically that an uncommanded nose-down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and this may be accompanied by an uncommanded rolling motion.

            "explanation": "Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that decreasing load factor (push-over maneuver) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is correct. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that increasing weight (mass) decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

There are two types of boundary layer; the laminar and the turbulent boundary layer. In the laminar boundary layer, the flow moves parallel to the surface over which it flows. In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is called the transition point. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction. This air creates more drag than the laminar air flow, has more kinetic energy (higher mean speed) and breaks down less easily and is therefore more stable.",

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is incorrect.",

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

THE INCIPIENT SPIN (figures 1 and 2) If the wing drops at the stall, the resulting rolling action alters the direction of the relative airflow on to the wing. It increases the angle of attack of the down-going wing and reduces the angle of attack of the up-going wing. The down-going wing becomes more stalled, leading to a reduction in the coefficient of lift and an increase in the coefficient of drag. Conversely, the up-going wing becomes less stalled, leading to an increase in the coefficient of lift and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. The difference in lift between the wings produces a rolling moment and the aircraft rolls in the direction of the down-going wing. The yawing moment resulting from the large difference in drag between the down-going and up-going wings further aids this. These moments lead to autorotation: the aircraft continues to roll, a side-slip develops, and the nose drops. Without corrective action, the rate of rotation steadily increases, resulting in a fully developed spin. SPIN RECOVERY Although the POH is the primary reference for recovery from a spin, the following can be used as a general procedure: P - Retard the throttle to idle. In most aircraft, power hampers the recovery. A - Ailerons neutral. Many pilots will attempt to recover from the spin using the ailerons. This may actually make the problem worse. R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline. Remember to neutralize the rudder after the rotation stops.",

Despite its smaller size, the aerodynamic consequences of icing mirror those of the main wing, causing a stall at a reduced angle of attack. Typically set at a negative angle of attack (negative tail), the tailplane generates downward force to counterbalance lift. However, should the tailplane stall and this downward force diminish, the aircraft's nose will pitch downward, resulting in a loss of longitudinal control. Vigilance for indicators of a tail stall, such as elevator buffet or roll oscillations, is crucial. Unlike wing stalls, tail stalls may not trigger conventional stall warning systems, emphasizing the need for keen observation, especially in conditions conducive to icing.",

There are two types of boundary layer; the laminar and the turbulent boundary layer. In the laminar boundary layer, the flow moves parallel to the surface over which it flows. In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction. This air creates more drag than the laminar air flow, has more kinetic energy and breaks down less easily and is therefore more stable.",

The range of speeds (margin) between high and low speed buffeting can be decreased by: Higher aircraft weight - As the aircraft mass increases, the low speed buffet increases and the high speed buffet decreases.

            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

The separated and turbulent airflow from the root affects the empennage and aerodynamic buffet will provide a warning of the approaching stall to the pilot.

Stalling of an ice contaminated tail plane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tail plane. If the tail plane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall.

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that increasing load factor decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is correct. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that decreasing weight (mass) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

The speeds are a bit ridiculous also, a stall speed of 175 kt? that's far too high for the vast majority of aircraft. Load factor = Lift/Weight, and also indicates the G-force felt by the aircraft and occupants. A load factor of 2.25 means 2.25Gs of force, and also means that the wings are producing 2.25x the lift required to counteract weight. With this much lift being produced, a high angle of attack is required and the stall speed therefore increases massively. This is the same as flying a steep turn. Given that the equation to find the new stall speed is: VS = VS1G √n Where: VS is the new stall speed VS1G is the 1G stall speed n is the load factor And given that VS1G = 175 kt and n = 2.25 VS = 175 √2.25 VS = 262.5 kt Closest answer 261 kt",

The rotation is stable and will continue due to remaining aerodynamic forces. During the spin, the wings remain unequally stalled. The key to recovery is first identifying the direction of the spin and then applying opposite yaw. In an erect (upright) spin, the aircraft yaws rapidly in the direction of the spin and typically rolls in the same direction. However, if the spin is unstable, the roll may not align with the spin direction and can even reverse. In an inverted spin, yaw and roll are almost always in opposite directions. The turn indicator and turn coordinator behave differently during a spin. A turn indicator, which is not sensitive to roll, correctly identifies the direction of the spin. Conversely, a turn coordinator, which is sensitive to roll, may indicate the wrong spin direction during an unstable or inverted spin. Thus, a turn indicator is the preferred instrument for aerobatic aircraft and those with more challenging spinning characteristics.",

As altitude increases and the air gets thinner, the IAS will reduce for a given pitch setting. Consequently, the angle of attack also reduces.

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

Indications of an impending stall can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning. Full Stall—a full stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically that an uncommanded nose-down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and this may be accompanied by an uncommanded rolling motion. For airplanes equipped with stick pushers, its activation is also a full stall indication. The longer it takes for the pilot to recognize an impending stall, the more likely it is that a full stall will result.

The maximum operating altitude of an airplane can be restricted by the load factor. Above that altitude any turbulence may induce Mach buffet, which could cause the airplane to exceed the maximum permitted load factor. The airflow behind a shockwave is turbulent and can cause a rapid vibrating movement of the horizontal stabilizer surfaces and is often referred to as the ‘shock stall’ and is the primary cause of high-speed buffet. A secondary cause of the rapid movement of the control surfaces, especially with supercritical airfoil sections, is when the wing reaches a speed of MCRIT the relatively weak shockwave that forms moves rapidly backward and forward over the surface of the wing producing similar indications to those of the shock stall.",

In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is called the transition point. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction. This air creates more drag than the laminar air flow, has more kinetic energy (higher mean speed) and breaks down less easily and is therefore more stable.",

            "explanation": "When the lift developed by an aeroplane wing is no longer sufficient to sustain the mass of the aeroplane in flight, in the configuration being considered, the wing is stalled. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d. Unresponsive flight controls.",

            ],
            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

If an aircraft does not present with natural buffeting before the stall, then stall warners or stick shakers will be fitted to warn of the impending stall. As for the other options: The centre of pressure does move aft during the stall of most wings, which helps provide the necessary pitch down moment to break the stall and begin recovery, however, it is not the cause of any buffeting. A stall occurring over the section of the wing with ailerons would cause aileron buffeting through the controls, but this means the wing is completely stalled, not pre-stall, as the wing root is designed to stall first, and the wing tips are designed to stall last, to preserve aileron effectiveness in the stall and prevent wing drops.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. Note: Flying in turbulent conditions may cause sudden changes in speed and load factor. Looking at the buffet margin graph attached, we can conclude that both speed/mach variations and changes in load factor may bring the aircraft closer to one of the buffet margins.",

In a spin, the aircraft is stalled but not evenly, and the inside wing has a higher angle of attack so is stalled more than the outside wing, creating a continuous spiraling stall, called a spin. The way to recover from a stall is given in the POH, but a general rule for most aircraft is as follows. P - Retard the throttle to idle. In most aircraft, power hampers the recovery. A - Ailerons neutral. Many pilots will attempt to recover from the spin using the ailerons. This may actually make the problem worse. R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive. Once you have completed the four previous steps, and the rotation stops, recover from the dive. The descent rate may be over 5000 feet per minute and the airspeed will rapidly exceed redline. Remember to neutralize the rudder after the rotation stops. The application of aft elevator pressure could quite easily send the aircraft into a further stall/spin, as this would try to continue increasing the angle of attack. However, if the aircraft becomes fully unstalled, then this action may actually take the aircraft into a spiral dive instead and potentially overload the wings with high load factor. As for the other options, a secondary spin in the other direction usually comes from continuing to apply rudder after recovering (with too low airspeed) and yaw instability is not related to this scenario. The aircraft is also descending through this process, so no climb rate should be expected.",

At low altitudes, these speeds are far apart, leaving a wide range of operating speeds. Although stalling IAS remains constant at first as altitude increases, it starts to increase at higher altitude. Also, the IAS at which we get Mach buffet will steadily decrease, because TAS increases in the climb and local speed of sound decreases. The two buffet boundaries will move closer toogether and eventually meet at an altitude where no margins exists, the coffin corner or aerodynamic ceiling, i.e. you cannot fly faster or slower because you will either stall or hit MMO. The right-hand limit on the graph shows the maximum indicated airspeed VMO and then at high altitude the maximum Mach number, MMO. The left-hand limit is based on the stall speed, 1.1 VS.

Consequently, more lift is required which means that the angle of attack must be increased. This will increase the stall speed. Any airplane, within the limits of its structure and the strength of the pilot, can be stalled at any airspeed. VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin.

This tendency can be reduced by design modifications (wing fences, vortilons and saw tooth leading edges) which minimize the root-to-tip spanwise flow of the boundary layer. These devices delay tip stall. Vortex generators are also frequently used on a swept wing to delay tip stall and improve the stall characteristics. The wing root can also be encouraged to stall first. This can be done by modifying the aerofoil section at the root, fitting stall strips and by fitting less efficient leading edge flaps (Kruger flaps) to the inboard section of the wing. During the recovery ailerons can be used with smooth and coordinated application of rudder.",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

The correct option has been the same or very similar in all feedback so far, and therefore we have added this as a single question. Please inform us in the comments if you see this question in the exam, and please add information about anything different you remember, along with your exam authority, thank you! As you will likely know by this point, aircraft drag at low subsonic speeds is split into 2 components, parasite drag and induced drag. For unstalled flight, the induced drag decreases with speed and parasite drag increases with speed, as shown above, creating the familiar total drag graph. Therefore, as the pilot in question slows the aircraft down when close to the stall, the induced drag will increase quite significantly and the parasite drag will gradually decrease. When the aircraft does actually stall though, the rules become more complex. Induced drag is actually short for \"lift-induced drag\", and when the aircraft stalls, it loses a lot of lift, so therefore the lift induced drag decreases somewhat after the stall. Parasite drag, however, no longer fits the usual curve, as the aircraft now has a much larger frontal area, as it has a very high (fully stalled) angle of attack, and therefore the air is hitting the underside of the fuselage, wings and tailplane much more than previously. This is not streamlined at all, so the parasite drag increases after the stall, and the more stalled the aircraft gets, the larger the parasite drag. Together, this means that total drag continues increasing after the stall.",

Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions.

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Aircraft must therefore be operated with a (safety) margin to aerodynamic buffet. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved: - Load factor. - Mach number. - Angle of attack. - Pressure altitude. - Weight. - CG position. LOAD FACTOR Because load factor increases the stall speed, different curves can be drawn for all values of load factor up to the maximum permissible ‘g’, and together they constitute the set of stalling boundaries for the given aircraft. Such a set of curves is shown in attached figure. Superimposed on these curves are dashed lines representing lines of constant Mach number, showing how high Mach numbers can be achieved, even at relatively low EAS, at high altitudes. Encountering wind shear increases the load factor, which increases the stall speed. This means that the margin to the low speed buffet margin is decreased. Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries.",

            "explanation": "The lift from a wing is generated by airflow over it from front to back. If the span-wise flow increases, the boundary layer on the wing surface travels for longer. This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem, as the CP for an unswept wing will move backwards as the aircraft approaches and exceeds CLMAX. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

            "explanation": "Spinning is a condition of stalled flight in which an aircraft describes a downward spiral path, and is normally the by-product of wing drop when operating near the stall. THE INCIPIENT SPIN (figures 1 and 2) If the wing drops at the stall, the resulting rolling action alters the direction of the relative airflow on to the wing. It increases the angle of attack of the down-going wing and reduces the angle of attack of the up-going wing. The down-going wing becomes more stalled, leading to a reduction in the coefficient of lift and an increase in the coefficient of drag. Conversely, the up-going wing becomes less stalled, leading to an increase in the coefficient of lift and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. The difference in lift between the wings produces a rolling moment and the aircraft rolls in the direction of the down-going wing. The yawing moment resulting from the large difference in drag between the down-going and up-going wings further aids this. These moments lead to autorotation: the aircraft continues to roll, a side-slip develops, and the nose drops. Without corrective action, the rate of rotation steadily increases, resulting in a fully developed spin. FULLY DEVELOPED SPIN It is usual for the aircraft to rotate several times around a spin axis before settling into a steady state spin, with the final pitch attitude depending mainly on the position of the centre of gravity. The spin can be either flat or steep. This condition is reached when the rate of rotation and sink stabilise at constant values. When this occurs, the forces and moments acting are considered to be in equilibrium and the relative airflow comes vertically upward to meet the aircraft. FORWARD CG This results in a steeper spin and a faster rate of sink. This makes the recovery easier because the spin is less stable. AFT CG This results in a flatter spin and a lower rate of sink. This makes the recovery more difficult, because the spin is more stable. If the centre of gravity is aft of its permitted limits, it significantly reduces the likelihood of recovery from a settled spin condition. When an aircraft is in a steep spin rotation it is primarily in roll, whereas in a flat spin it is primarily in yaw. (figure 3)",

With the cg furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward cg then with a rearward cg. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its cg, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the cg will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A cg on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

            "explanation": "\"The aeroplane may suffer an excessive load factor and damage during the stall recovery exercises.\" Incorrect. The question's mention of \"excessive\" stick inputs, creates the impression that the aircraft might experience a high load factor and potential damage during recovery exercises. Nevertheless, the fact that they limit the speed increase to only 130 kt, well below VNE, minimizes the actual risk of structural damage. \"If too much elevator is used to recover from the spiral dive, the aeroplane may stall and enter a spin.\" Incorrect. If excessive pulling occurs and surpasses the critical angle of attack, the aircraft will stall. However, what the examiner likely intends is that when initially employing ailerons to level the wings and recover from a spiral dive, there's no need for an \"excessive\" application of elevator. The essence of the statement is to emphasize not pulling too hard at the detection of a spiral dive but prioritizing leveling the wings first. It's crucial to recall that in a spiral dive, the wings are not yet stalled, making it imperative to first halt the rolling moment and then initiate a pull to recover lost altitude. In contrast, a spin involves a stall, necessitating a recovery process of pushing the control stick initially, followed by maintaining neutral ailerons and applying rudder in the opposite direction of the spin. \"The rudder must be used to roll the wings level from the spiral dive, as the ailerons may cause excessive wing bending.\" Incorrect. In contrast to a spin, a recovery from a spiral dive involves initially leveling off to counteract the excessive static directional stability relative to lateral stability, thereby stopping the rolling moment. It's crucial to execute this maneuver cautiously to prevent any potential structural damage. If the rudder is applied before the ailerons in this situation, additional stress is imposed on the airframe because the aircraft is already in a nose-down attitude with a sideslip, further banking due to directional stability. This is why stall escape maneuvers or upset recovery procedures in commercial airliners explicitly avoid instructing the use of the rudder pedals.",

            "explanation": "Wing loading is directly proportional to weight, and as we have seen above, an increase in weight, increases stall speed since the wings need to fly at a higher angle of attack to generate enough lift for a given airspeed. Wing Loading = Weight / Wing Area Any airplane, within the limits of its structure and the strength of the pilot, can be stalled at any airspeed. VS = √(2W ÷ p S CLMAX) The equation above well defines the factors affecting the stall speed, in summary; aircraft weight, air density, maximum lift coefficient, and the load factor. AIRCRAFT WEIGHT. Stall speed is proportional with the aircraft weight. Stall speed increases, as the weight increases; and decreases as the weight decreases. AIR DENSITY. Aircraft stall speeds are usually given in terms of CAS or IAS as an aircraft limitations. However, as seen in the equation above, it is actually a true airspeed which is inversely proportional with the density. Therefore, although it is constant in terms of CAS/IAS, it increases with the altitude because of the density variation. MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT. Maximum lift coefficient may be varied by high lift devices such as flaps and slats. Higher maximum lift coefficients will result in slower stall speeds. Lowest maximum lift coefficient is obtained when flaps are retracted (airplane in clean configuration), thus highest stall speed occurs in clean configuration. LOAD FACTOR. Stall speed is proportional with the load factor. It increases as the load factor increases. If VSS is the stall speed of an aircraft in steady level flight, then stall speed during maneuvers will be: VSN =√n VSS Or during a turn maneuver: VSN = VSS ÷ √ cos a",

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

The stick pushers will automatically disengage when the angle of attack reaches below a suitable value. Stick pushers are mandatory for aircraft that are prone to deep stalls. For an aircraft mounted with both the stick shaker system and stick pusher system, the sequence of events is as follows: First as a warning of impeding stall, the stick shaker will activate and a corrective action by the pilot is expected. As the angle of attack keeps increasing and reaches a pre set dangerous value that might be unrecoverable, the stick pusher will activate and force the nose down. The stick shaker will stay active during the entire duration of the stick pusher, but not vice versa. Therefore the stick shaker activates at a lower angle of attack than the stick pusher, and the stick pusher prevents the pilot from increasing the angle of attack further.",

This means that the two aircraft will be affected by thrust changes in different ways. We call the high mounted engines on aeroplane 1 \"thrust stabilising\", as they produce thrust through or above the line of our CG, so cause a small pitch down moment when extra thrust is applied, which gains airspeed. The underslung engines on aeroplane 2 have a much lower thrust line, so the aircraft will pitch up significantly when thrust is increased. This is a de-stabilising effect, as the airspeed may actually reduce with increased engine thrust, due to the pitch up moment. In the go-around then, aircraft 1 will handle as expected, with full thrust causing an acceleration, and pitch up command required to achieve the +12º go-around attitude. In aircraft 2, it is highly likely that applying full power will pitch the aeroplane so much nose up that the pilots will have to push on the controls to avoid over-rotating and losing valuable speed.

A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Aircraft with swept-back wings are prone to deep stall, regardless of horizontal stabilizer position (T-tail or low tail). T-tail will worsen recovery characteristics. Swept-forward wings at very high angle of attack are prone to deep stall as well. However, if a low horizontal tail is fitted, some pitch down moment may be produced with the help of the horizontal stabilizer since it is out of the separated turbulent wake of the wing. \"II. A stick shaker system is fitted to an aeroplane to resolve deep stall problems.\" INCORRECT A stick shaker, as the name suggests shakes the control colum warning the pilot of an impeding stall.

A deep stall happens when an aircraft main wing stalls, but the angle of airflow means that the stalled air flows directly over the horizontal tailplane. This usually happens on T-tail aircraft, as the tail often becomes about level with the wing at critical angle of attack. This turbulent flow will mean that there is little or no elevator control, and the horizontal stabiliser is not producing any controllable lift. This can leave the aircraft without any pitch control, causing a potentially unrecoverable deep stall (a.k.a. a super stall). Aircraft with deep stall characteristics are often fitted with a stick-pusher to avoid reaching that point. The other design feature they could ask about is underslung engines. Underslung engines are mounted under the main wings, as is most common on modern jets. When thrust is increased on these engines, a very large pitch-up moment is induced, due to their thrust line being far below the centre of gravity. As thrust is often added to recover from a stall, this could cause an upwards pitch which could overpower even full nose-down pitch control at low speeds. We call this thrust line \"destabilising\". The high mounted tail engines seen on many smaller jets are not susceptible to this effect, as they have a high thrust line and a \"stabilising\" thrust moment.",

The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Flying at a different speed will not influence the buffet boundaries, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. At altitude, the equivalent stalling speed increases with ‘g’ rather more rapidly than at sea level, because of the Mach number effect on CLMAX. Also, the buffet boundary becomes much more severe. Above a certain altitude the buffet boundary may intersect the stall boundary at a value of ‘g’ lower than the structural limit. This ‘point’ is another representation of “coffin corner”.

EFFECT OF HEAVY RAIN ON STALL SPEED - Weight Heavy rain will form a film of water on an aircraft and increase its weight slightly, maybe as much as 1 - 2% this in itself will increase stall speed. - Aerodynamic Effect The film of water will distort the aerofoil, roughen the surface and alter the airflow pattern on the whole aircraft. CLMAX will decrease causing stall speed to increase. - Drag The film of water will increase interference drag, profile drag and form drag. In light rain, drag may increase by 5%, in moderate by 20% and in heavy rain by up to 30%. - Impact An additional consideration, while not affecting stall speed, is the effect of the impact of heavy rain on the aircraft. Momentum will be lost and airspeed will decrease, requiring increased thrust. At the same time, heavy rain will also be driving the aircraft downwards. The volume of rain in any given situation will vary, but an aircraft on final approach which suddenly enters a torrential downpour of heavy rain will be subject to a loss of momentum and a decrease in altitude, similar to the effect of microburst windshear.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded.",

R - Apply full opposite rudder. Apply rudder opposite the rotation of the spin. If you have trouble determining which way the airplane is spinning, look at your turn coordinator or turn needle. It will indicate the direction of rotation. E - Apply forward elevator. Immediately after applying opposite rudder, apply a quick forward motion on the control yoke and hold anti-spin controls until the aircraft starts to recover. D - Recover from the dive.

The situation worsens if the nose is still high and the thrust setting low. - On leaving the downdraught, increasing tail winds cause a further reduction in IAS (Temporary Energy Loss). The rate of descent may lessen due to increased thrust availability. This may lead to a reduction in airspeed below the stalling speed and if operating at high angles of attack, which are normally associated with the approach and landing phases of flight, the wing may stall. A successful recovery from a microburst encounter depends on the altitude, thrust, and speed reserves available. In addition to these effects, severe wind, turbulence, heavy rain, and blinding flashes of lightning often accompany microbursts.",

            "explanation": "The boundary layer is the layer of fluid (in our case this fluid is the atmosphere) in the immediate surface of a bounding surface (the airfoil) where the effects of viscosity are significant. There are two types of boundary layer; the laminar and the turbulent boundary layer. In the laminar boundary layer, the flow moves parallel to the surface over which it flows. In the laminar boundary layer, the air flows very smoothly. The velocity increases with distance from the airfoil and there is no movement of air perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Laminar flow creates less friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. At a distance from the leading edge of the airfoil, the air transitions from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This air does not flow smoothly, it contains swirls. There is flow in parallel and perpendicular direction. This air creates more drag than the laminar air flow, has more kinetic energy and breaks down from the surface less easily and is therefore more stable.",

Any further increase above this stalling angle, or critical angle of attack, will make it impossible for the airflow to smoothly follow the upper wing contour, and the flow will separate from the surface, causing CL to decrease and drag to increase rapidly. A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALL RECOVERY To recover from a stall or prevent a full stall, the angle of attack must be decreased to reduce the adverse pressure gradient. This may consist of merely releasing back pressure, or it may be necessary to smoothly move the pitch control forward, depending on the aircraft design and severity of the stall. Allow airspeed to increase and recover lost altitude with moderate back pressure on the pitch control. Pulling too hard could trigger a secondary stall, or worse, could exceed the limit load factor and damage the aircraft structure. As angle of attack reduces below the critical angle, the adverse pressure gradient will decrease, airflow will re-attach, and lift and drag will return to their normal values.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. In this exercise: Start by drawing a line from de 1g load factor that intersects the 130-ton curve. From here, draw a straight line from right to left that intersects the FL410 curve. The goal is to have to intersection points, which correspond to the lowest and highest limits of the buffet boundaries.

This causes them to be thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation. The normal tip vortice on a swept wing joins up with a leading edge separation bubble, creating a larger vortex called the Ram’s horn vortex. This vortex goes inboard along the wing’s leading edge. The downward flow from the vortex induces pressure on the boundary layer at the wingtip, whereas on straight wings the exact opposite occurs. With a swept wing, this creates a slow-moving layer of air at the wing tip. This slow-moving air will separate into disturbed flow and will then stall the tip. As the wingtips for a swept wing are positioned aft of the center of pressure (CP), the center of pressure upon a wing tip stall will move forward, creating a nose up moment. This nose up moment will further increase the Angle of Attack if not corrected in time, increasing the layer of slow-moving air, worsening the situation. Due to the decreased downwash on the elevator, the elevator could be less responsive, creating a so called deep stall. Unswept wings do not have this problem. The pitch up phenomenon is a dangerous characteristic of swept wing aircraft (with a T-tail) that move at high speed. It could result in a quickly worsening stalling situation, making it very hard to recover.",

If an accidental stall does occur, it is vitally important that the stall and recovery should occur without too much wing drop. Moving a control surface modifies the chord line and, hence, the angle of attack. An aircraft being flown close to the stall angle may have one wing that produces slightly less lift than the other; that wing will tend to drop. Trying to lift a dropping wing with aileron will increase its angle of attack, and may cause the wing to stall completely, resulting in that wing dropping at an increased rate. At speeds close to the stall, ailerons must be used with caution. On straight wing aircraft the rudder should be used to yaw the aircraft just enough to increase the speed of a dropping wing to maintain a wing’s level attitude. Swept wing aircraft basic stall requirements are designed to enable the ailerons to be used successfully up to ”stall recognition”, but small amounts of rudder can be used if smoothly applied and co-ordinated with the ailerons. If an aileron is lowered when flying at high angles of attack, that wing could possibly stall. In that case the wing will drop instead of rising as intended.",

            "explanation": "Note: The feedback for this question is quite limited, and there is another option that is very close to being correct, but we are happy with our choice of correct answer. Please send us any further exam feedback you have about this question, thank you! The vast majority of aircraft are never meant to stall, but it is always a possibility, no matter how many measures the designers put in to stop it occurring. This is why aircraft must be made to be controllable and predictable at stalling. In particular, we want the aircraft to have a nose down moment at the stall, and we want the controls to be effective at the stall. One way the controls could become ineffective at the stall is with a T-tail horizontal stabiliser design. Whilst a T-tail design usually takes the horizontal stabiliser away from the wake of the main wing, when the aircraft is pitched at the stalling angle of attack, often the horizontal stabiliser is in the zone of stalled airflow, where little to no lift can be gained. This is called a \"deep stall\" (or a super-stall) and makes the elevators quite useless, and even an all moving tailplane (which you would not usually find in a T-tail configuration) would be quite useless too. This is why most T-tail aircraft have a stall prevention device fitted called a stick pusher, which will put in a very strong pitch down control force just before the \"deep stall\" is reached. As we have already mentioned, there is another option present that is very close to correct. \"Aft mounted engines, as an increase in thrust produces a nose down moment.\" We call this a stabilising thrust line, because the addition of thrust helps us gain airspeed by causing a pitch down moment as well as an increase in thrust. In our opinion it would be useful to have during stall. However, the controllability during and after the stall would not strictly be affected by this, only the ability to recover from the stall. If you interpret the question slightly differently, then this could be considered correct, but we would say it is not quite correct. \"Position of horizontal stabiliser, e.g. a T-tail makes it harder to recover from a stall.\" As discussed above, this makes a huge difference to stall controllability, especially due to the ability of a T-tail design to go into a \"deep stall\". \"Supercritical wings increase nose up tendency in a stall.\" Supercritical wings do stall slightly differently (much faster and less gradual), but this does not really relate to a nose up tendency. Also, this option does not really answer the question above, so it is incorrect. \"Using roll spoilers increases the chance of aileron reversal near the stall.\" This one filled in incomplete feedback. Do not expect it in the exam. Aileron reversal (low speed) can happen if an aileron drops near the stall, increasing the AoA passed the stalling AoA and causing a reversal of the requested turn direction.",

DEEP STALL A deep stall is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs when the turbulence created by the main wing encompasses the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft, preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. T-tail aircraft are most likely to have deep stall characteristics. When the main wing stalls, the stabilizer becomes ineffective because it is situated in the separated turbulent flow of the wing and sometimes the fuselage. This can lead to a very dangerous scenario where the aircraft can sit stable in the deep stall, with no control surface left working to get out of the situation. A common way to prevent deep stall in these types of aircraft is a stick pusher device, which detects high angles of attack, approaching the stall, and instead of notifying the pilots of this (a stick shaker, stall warner, etc.), it actually pushes the stick forwards without any pilot intervention.",

A windshear encounter is a very dynamic event which can strike suddenly and with devastating effect which has been beyond the recovery powers of experienced pilots flying modern and powerful aircraft. The first and most vital defence is avoidance. AWARENESS AND AVOIDANCE Awareness of the weather conditions that cause windshear will reduce the risk of an encounter. If a windshear encounter is likely, the takeoff or landing should be delayed until the conditions improve, e.g. until a thunderstorm has moved away from the airport. Windshear represents a severe threat to aviation safety, the best option is to avoid it whenever possible. Nevertheless, in the case of an actual encounter with windshear, it is essential to be to quickly recognize it and then recover from it. PREVENTION A key element of adverse weather avoidance strategies is the active monitoring of the overall meteorological situation by the crew, in addition to the optimum use of the weather radar and correct understanding of the information displayed. The take-off, initial climb, final approach and landing phases of flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms may present the pilot with additional problems because of the airplane‘s proximity to the ground. To maintain a safe flight path in these phases can be very difficult. Do not take off if a thunderstorm is overhead or approaching. At destination, hold if a thunderstorm is overhead or approaching or divert if necessary. On the approach, if there is ever any doubt that you can regain a reasonable rate of descent, and land without abnormal manoeuvres, you should apply full power and go-around or make a missed approach. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Delay the approach, and divert if necessary. CORRECT: As the explanation suggests, in case of thunderstorm activity, the first mitigating action should be to avoid and therefore delay take-off/landing or divert if necessary. 2. Plan a flapless approach and landing. INCORRECT: Flaps/slats should be used for every normal approach, including those with thunderstorms present as they lower the stall speed and in the case of slats increase the critical angle of attack. 3. Maintain a speed at least 30 kt above normal approach speed. INCORRECT: Choosing to fly at a speed slightly higher than normal approach speed is a good technique to aid with speed fluctuations characteristic of thunderstorm activity. However, this would be type specific, and there is no general rule for an approach to be flown 30 knots faster than normal. 4. Delay landing flap selection until 200 ft. INCORRECT: Delaying the configuration of the aircraft is not a recommended for this type of approach, specially to as low as 200 ft. 5. Expect and prepare for a windshear warning and a go-around. CORRECT: As stated above, the first mitigating action should be to avoid the thunderstorms. On the approach, if avoiding is not possible, the crew should be prepared to perform a go-around.",

This characteristic of the air is its viscosity, which although very small, is enough for the molecules of the air in contact with a surface to stick to the surface. It is static and therefore causes the laminar streamline flow adjacent to this layer to slow down, which in turn produces turbulence. The speed of the airflow changes from zero at the surface of the airfoil to the full speed of the free flow airstream a few millimeters away from the surface. This thin layer of sluggish air that clings to the surface of the object and in which the speed change of the airflow takes place is the boundary layer. In aerodynamics the boundary layer is important when considering wing stall, skin friction drag and heat transfer in high-speed flight. Boundary layers may be laminar (layered) or turbulent (disordered). The boundary layer increases in thickness as it moves rearward over an aircraft wing, with the turbulent boundary layer being proportionally thicker than the laminar boundary layer under the same free stream velocity conditions. The turbulent boundary layer has much higher local velocities immediately adjacent to the surface. The airflow in this region therefore possesses much higher kinetic energy than the laminar boundary layer at the same distance above the surface. The rapid velocity change associated with the turbulent boundary layer is evidence of high skin friction drag. The turbulent boundary has less tendency to separate from the airfoil surface over which it is flowing than the laminar boundary layer because it is better able to withstand the positive pressure gradient.",

If, however, compressibility is not ignored then the stalling IAS value slowly increases with increased altitude, but the change only becomes significant at very high altitudes. At a constant EAS, Mach number will increase as altitude increases. Figure 1 shows the variation of stalling speed with altitude at constant load factor (n). Such a curve is called the stalling boundary for the given load factor, in which altitude is plotted against equivalent airspeed. At this load factor (1g), the aircraft cannot fly at speeds to the left of this boundary. Over the lower range of altitude, stall speed does not vary with altitude. This is because at these low altitudes, the Mach number at VS is too low for compressibility effects to be present. Eventually (approximately 30000 ft), Mach number at VS has increased with altitude to such an extent that these effects are important, and the rise in stalling speed with altitude is apparent. As altitude increases, stall speed is initially constant then increases, due to compressibility.",

As you enter the vortex ring, you experience turbulence and a rapid increase in IAS as you pick up a headwind. You start to climb as your performance increases. 2. As you enter the strongest part of the horizontal shaft, your airspeed peaks at 100 knots, an increase of 20 knots. You're still climbing as you enter the downdraft. 3. Inside the downdraft, your headwind starts to switch to a tailwind. You're caught in the downdraft, sinking quickly toward the ground. Your airspeed begins to decrease. 4. As you exit the downdraft, your tailwind increases rapidly. The shear drops your airspeed to 60 knots, which is 20 knots below your original speed.

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. The margin between the two types of stall narrows with increasing altitude. Notably the true airspeed of the low-speed stall increases with increasing altitude for a given indicated airspeed, whilst the true airspeed of the shock stall reduces up to the base of the tropopause, above which it remains constant. The point at which the two stalls coincide is referred to as the 'coffin corner'. The altitude at which an aircraft can fly at one airspeed in a 1g maneuver is called the aerodynamic ceiling. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3g will initiate the buffet onset.",

Please let us know if you see it in your exam, and which exam that is, thank you! TAILPLANE STALL Whilst it is not immediately identifiable by the question, this is asking about tailplane stalls due to icing. The tailplane (or horizontal stabiliser) is a second wing mounted at the rear of the aircraft to allow for stability, and for control (with the elevator), and in fact, is usually used to provide downwards lift to keep the aircraft's nose up, and counteract the weight/lift couple (which pushes the nose down). The tailplane is often quite a lot thinner than the main wing, so it builds up ice quicker, and means that tailplane stall due to icing can occur when there is little to no main wing ice accretion. A tailplane stall is made worse by the extension of flaps, as they increase the downwash from the main wing, which causes a larger negative angle of attack on the tailplane, which is more likely to stall the tailplane. Flaps also move the centre of pressure further back, which increases the Cg/Cp (Weight/Lift) couple, which means the elevator needs to create more downforce to keep the nose up. As the downforce from the tail decreases due to tail stall, there is a strong nose-down moment created. This is made worse - as mentioned above - by the use of flaps. The worst speed/configuration for this type of stall is just under the maximum flap speed (VFE), with flaps extended.",

When swept wings are unmodified, they have a strong tendency to stall first near the tips. Loss of lift at the tips moves the CP forward, giving a nose-up pitching moment as the lift is being produce from further forwards. This tendency to tip stall is due to the induced spanwise flow of the boundary layer from root to tip. During a tip stall, all the lift production is concentrated inboard and the maximum downwash now impacts the tail plane, adding to the nose-up pitching moment. As soon as a swept wing begins to stall, both forward CP movement and increased downwash at the tail plane cause the aircraft nose to rise rapidly, further increasing the angle of attack. This is a very undesirable and unacceptable response at the stall and can result in complete loss of control in pitch from which it may be very difficult, or even impossible, to recover. This is a very dangerous characteristic of many high speed, swept wing aircraft. For this reason, commercial swept wing aircraft are fitted with modifications to ensure the root stalls first. These can be vortex generators, or washout of the wing to reduce the tip angle of incidence, etc.",

This can lead to efficiencies in terms of lift distribution and induced drag, but when they are unmodified, produce less than ideal stalling characteristics. Wings on large aircraft are usually tapered and swept back, but here we are talking of unswept wings only. Tapered wings are prone to stalling first near the wing tips, and this stall spreads out forwards and inwards towards the root. This is undesireable as the stall affects the ailerons first, and makes this planform very susceptible to a violent wing drop. The first sign of stall on these aeroplanes often comes as a buffet through the ailerons, starting light and getting heavier, until the ailerons are fully stalled and have either a reverse effect or very little effect on aircraft control. Given where the stall occurs, and the likelihood of an early wing drop, elevator buffet is unlikely and pitching moments are quite limited. There is sometimes a pitch down moment due to the Centre of Pressure moving rearwards during the stall, but it is often not enough to avoid the formation of a spin. Hence, these aircraft wing planforms are usually modified in some way to avoid tip stalls and encourage the wing roots to stall first.",

In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range. The limits associated with these effects give the buffet boundaries. For a given aircraft there is a Mach number which, even at low angle of attack, cannot be exceeded because of the onset of shock stall. The EAS corresponding to this Mach number falls as altitude increases, so the range of operating speeds is reduced at both ends. Also, an increase in load factor (bank angle) requires an increase in lift at a given EAS, hence an increase in angle of attack and a further reduction in limiting Mach number. Thus, the greater the load factor (bank angle or gust), the more severe the limitation due to buffeting. We can then conclude that decreasing load factor (push-over maneuver) increases the buffet margin, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. The weight of the aircraft also affects the envelope. An increase in weight results in an increase in stall speed, and the stall boundary is moved to the right. It also results in an increase in angle of attack at any given speed, so that the Mach number at which buffeting occurs is reduced, and the buffet boundary is moved to the left. Finally, increase in weight implies a reduction in the maximum permissible ‘g’. Thus, all the boundaries are made more restrictive by an increase in weight. We can then conclude that increasing weight (mass) decreases the buffet margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

The ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone) is an area of very large uplift and often violent thunderstorms due to converging air at the surface. It is also a region where the tropopause will be incredibly high, sometimes in the region of 55-60,000 ft. This makes it often impossible to climb away from the turbulence experienced in that region. The turbulence can cause lots of passenger distress and potential for airframe fatigue and damage when it gets severe enough. It can also change our airspeed enough to put us into either the high- or low-speed buffeting region, so we should instead descend to a lower altitude, out of the potential “coffin corner” and fly at turbulence penetration speed (this usually means slowing down from cruise speed) to get the best safety margin for turbulence.",

A push-over manoeuvre is where the pilot pushes the controls forward and the load factor is reduced (usually to around zero G, but the manoeuvre is whenever the load factor is temporarily pushed below 1G). It is highly useful for reducing the load on the wings, and can break a stall immediately, as an aircraft cannot stall when the load factor is zero, allowing control to be regained temporarily to allow the aircraft to be stabilised and the airspeed to be increased. The angle of attack is reduced during a push-over manoeuvre, and this is a key part of unloading the wings.",

Load Factor = Lift / Weight LOAD FACTOR IN A TURN When an aircraft is in a banked turn, lift must be increased so as to maintain the vertical component of lift equal to weight. Load Factor (n) increases with bank angle at an increasing rate. To maintain altitude and airspeed when executing a turn both the angle of attack and the thrust have to be increased above their level flight values. This relationship may be expressed as: Load Factor (n) = 1 / cos φ Where φ = bank angle In a turn, load factor is a function ONLY of bank angle. RADIUS OF TURN Radius of turn is dependent on both airspeed and bank angle. Turn Radius = V2 / g tan Ø Where V = True Airspeed, g = acceleration of gravity constant of 9.81 m/s2, Ø = angle of bank The radius of turn at any given airspeed is inversly proportional to the bank angle. Which means that decreasing the bank angle results in a radius of turn that greater. RATE OF TURN Rate of turn is the rate of change of heading or angular velocity of the turn. Rate of turn = g tan Ø / V Increasing the speed results in a decrease of rate of turn. Whereas increasing bank angle, increases the rate of turn.",

A clean wing has a lower value of CLMAX, causing the Angle of Attack for a clean wing to be lower than for a wing with slats extended. A wing with flaps extended has the lowest value of CLMAX. In straight and level flight, prior to the stall, lift remains constant. Speed decreases and CL increases. In the stall (so after CLMAX has passed) the CL decreases again and speed is still low. Therefore lift decreases. The increased turbulent flow over the wing during the stall, the drag will be increased during the stall compared to the flight prior to the stall.",

Option a) \"maximum continuous thrust is required to remain in level flight.\" is not correct because the need for maximum continuous thrust to maintain level flight is not necessarily an indication of a stall. Option b) \"control effectiveness reduces, such that large deflection is needed to maintain wings level.\" is also not correct because while control effectiveness may reduce as the AOA increases, it is not a definitive indicator of a stall. Option c) \"the coefficient of lift decreases with increased angle of attack.\" is a true statement about the coefficient of lift, but it does not necessarily indicate a stall. Option d) \"buffet is so strong that it deters the pilot from further speed reduction.\" is the correct answer because when an airplane approaches a stall, the airflow over the wings becomes turbulent, which can cause buffeting or vibration of the aircraft. If the buffeting is strong enough, it can deter the pilot from further reducing the speed, as it is an indication that the airplane is approaching a stall.

Lift is inclined from the vertical by the bank angle φ of 45° and must be increased in order to balance the weight and produce a force to perform the turn. More lift compared to the same weight increases the load factor n. Influence of the Load Factor (n) on Stall Speed VS = VS1G x √ n Because the load factor (n) increases in a turn, stall speed will increase accordingly. An accelerated stall is caused by abrupt or excessive control movements inducing an increased load factor. An accelerated stall can occur during a sudden change in the flight path, during manoeuvres such as steep turns or a recovery from a descent. It is called an accelerated stall because it occurs at a load factor greater than 1g. The stall is more violent than a 1g stall and is often unexpected because of the relatively high airspeed.",

In descent the formula will become T= D – W sin(alfa) The load factor is the relationship between lift and weight. As the lift in a stall is decreased and the load factor in straight and level flight is 1, the load factor will now be less than 1. The steeper the climb-/descent angle, the lower the load factor.

During a skid, the aircraft is turning too fast for the bank angle, and yaws into the turn. (Most likely, you're pushing too much rudder and causing the skid.) That causes the outside wing to move faster, increasing its lift, and causing the aircraft to roll into the turn. You compensate by adding opposite aileron - increasing the angle of attack on the inside, low wing. As the inside wing exceeds the critical angle of attack, it stalls and drops. The downward deflected aileron on the low wing is still generating drag, which pulls the aircraft's nose further into the turn. And, the aircraft is still yawing into the turn from the rudder, which accelerates the roll. The result is a quick roll into the turn, and your entry into an incipient spin => In a skidding spin, the low/inside wing stalls first, which rolls the plane into the turn, flipping it \"inside\" or \"underneath\".",

            "explanation": "Flat spins are the worst and most dangerous type of spin. In a flat spin, the aircraft has no forward airspeed. It spins around its vertical axis as it sinks straight towards the ground. Due to the high angle of attack of a flat spin, it is nearly impossible to recover, as the horizontal stabilizer is most likely in stall, too. The only possibility then is to move the CG forward. In small aircraft what you can do is to lean forward and hope for the best. The type of spin a plane enters depends mainly on the CG Position (and thrust setting): CG towards the forward limit makes an aircraft more stable, and control forces will be higher which makes it less likely that large, abrupt control movements will be made. When trimmed, the aeroplane will tend to return to level flight if the controls are released, but the stall speed will be higher. CG towards the aft limit decreases longitudinal static stability and reduces pitch control forces, which tends to make the aeroplane easier to stall. Once a spin is entered, the further aft the CG, the flatter the spin attitude. All in all, do not spin with an aircraft that is not designed for that or with too aft CG position.

This speed is Mmo most of the time, sometimes it is slightly below. These speeds come closer together as altitude increases. At a certain altitude the aircraft can encounter the so called “Coffin corner”. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are very close together here, and thus it is easy to stall or hit Mmo. The coffin corner is a dangerous situation and is supposed to be avoided, as a slight amount of turbulence could cause the aircraft to stall. The speeds for high and low speed buffeting are dependent on weight, altitude, load factor and CG position. On the buffet onset boundary chart we will find the variables for altitude, weight and load factor.

            "explanation": "In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is correct. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

This is particularly dangerous in modes such as level change or flight level change, which maintain a constant airspeed/Mach No. in the climb, as the aircraft would pitch up more and more to try to reduce the \"increasing airspeed\", stalling the aircraft quite quickly. If the aircraft does not stall beforehand, then when maximum airspeed is reached, the pilots or autopilot/autothrottle will either reduce thrust or pitch up to avoid further airspeed increase, which will very quickly lead to a stall. As for the other options, the air data computer, autopilot and autothrottle systems have the same pitot inputs as the pilots do, so will not be able to protect the aircraft from this condition, that is one of the reasons that probe icing and blockages are so dangerous.",

If the wings have been mounted with different angles of incidence, then they will constantly be at a different angles of attack. The wing with the higher angle of incidence will always be at a higher angle of attack. Whilst this could be quite noticeable in normal flight, it would likely be most noticeable at or near the stall speed, where the wing with a slightly higher angle of attack will be the one to stall first, but whilst the other wing is still producing a lot of lift. This would cause a violent wing drop towards the side of the stalled wing. This theory is used on some wings to make sure that the wing root stalls first, by twisting the wing to give the root a higher angle of incidence than the wing tip. This is called \"washout\".",

This causes the boundary layer to separate behind the shock wave, leading to a loss of lift and reduction in the lift coefficient (CL) (shock stall). The shock stall occurs when the lift coefficient, as a function of Mach number, reaches its maximum value for a given angle of attack. Wings not specifically designed for high speeds may experience significant lift loss at speeds above MCRIT. However, wings designed for high-speed flight, incorporating features like sweepback, thinner sections, and reduced camber, exhibit much less variation in lift throughout the transonic region. Sweeping the wing back is a widely employed method to increase MCRIT, the critical Mach number. By employing a swept wing, the free stream velocity is effectively divided into two components: one perpendicular to the leading edge and the other parallel to it. The component perpendicular to the leading edge is less than the free stream velocity and it is this velocity component which determines the magnitude of the pressure distribution and hence MCRIT. Due to this reduced velocity component affecting the pressure distribution, MCRIT increases. Furthermore, on wings with low thickness to chord ratios, the airflow acceleration over the upper wing surface is diminished. Consequently, the value of MCRIT is raised on such wings.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.80 to the FL400 curve. From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor to asset the limiting weight. In this case, the limiting weight is 110 tons.",

A stall is caused by airflow separation. Separation can occur when either the boundary layer has insufficient kinetic energy or the adverse pressure gradient becomes too great. STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK At a constant mass and air density, the coefficient of lift (CL), and consequently the total amount of lift, is dependent on the angle of attack. Graphically, lift increases almost linearly from an angle of attack of 0º to 4º, and then at an increasing rate to 15º. Lift cannot be obtained without incurring the penalty of drag. At a specific angle of attack, depending on circumstances, the lift generated is insufficient to sustain the aircraft in level flight. The angle of attack at which this occurs is the stalling angle or critical angle and is the point at which CLMAX is attained. An aeroplane will not stall unless the critical angle is exceeded. The aeroplane may be considered stalled when the behaviour of the aeroplane gives a clear distinctive indication of an unacceptable nature to the pilot that the aeroplane is stalled. Acceptable indications of a stall, occurring either individually or in combination are: a. A nose-down pitch that cannot be readily arrested. b. Buffeting, of a magnitude and severity that is a strong and effective deterrent to further speed reduction. c. The pitch control reaches the aft stop and no further increase in pitch attitude occurs when the control is held full aft for a short time before recovery is initiated. d. Unresponsive flight controls.",

With the CG furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

This may lead to a reduction in airspeed below the stalling speed and if operating at high angles of attack, which are normally associated with the approach and landing phases of flight, the wing may stall. A successful recovery from a microburst encounter depends on the altitude, thrust, and speed reserves available.

Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved: - Load factor. - Mach number. - Angle of attack. - Pressure altitude. - Weight. - CG position. Stall boundaries set a lower limit to the operating speed, according to the load factor. In the case of a high-speed aircraft, there is also an upper limit which is due to the approach of shock stall and the associated buffet which occurs if the aircraft enters the transonic speed range.

This decreases the angle of attack at the tip, and the root will tend to stall first, which is desirable. The aerofoil section may be varied throughout the span such that sections with greater thickness and camber are located near the tip.

            "explanation": "The ITCZ The ITCZ in known for a trough that is centred on the thermal equator. High temperatures cause low pressure, The main feature of the ITCZ is extensive Cu, Cb, and thunderstorms. The cloud tops are sometimes as low as 20,000 ft but more frequently 50,000 ft or more. Turbulence is usually severe, as is icing, which can be from 16,000 ft upwards. Buffet Onset Chart In the same way that separated airflow prior to a low speed stall can cause airframe buffet, shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. The ‘Buffet Onset’ chart is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. Turbulence Penetration Speed For flight in turbulence an airspeed must be chosen to give margin against stalling and overstressing the aircraft structure. This speed is VRA/MRA (the rough-air speed) or turbulence penetration speed. VRA/MRA will give adequate protection from over-stressing the aircraft with maximum protection from an inadvertent stall. In conclusion, clear air turbulence (CAT) can be caused by jetstreams, Cb’s, mountain waves, etc. with the same consequences as the ITCZ or jetstreams. Thunderstorms should be circumnavigated and preferably upwind. Extensive use of weather radar scanning is useful. A turbulence penetration speed should be selected to minimise the gust loads on the aircraft. When possible, descent to a lower altitude should be considered as it gives more performance and buffet margin to cope with gusts.",

The pressure distribution over the front of the wing is, however, altered, which varies the position of the wing’s center of pressure and its overall pitching moment. This alters the wing’s angle of attack and results in rapid backward and forward movements of the shock waves. A kind of instability is set up, and the rapid changes in the pressure distribution result in vibration of the whole aircraft. This is primarily due to the distributed airflow behind the shock wave hitting the tail plane. If shock waves form on the control surfaces, it will also affect the stick forces by altering their hinge moments.",

By increasing the bank angle, the turn radius will reduce. If we increase the bank angle, a pull force on the stick will be required to maintain the same altitude. However, if no action is taken to maintain the airspeed, it will decrease and may lead to a stall. \"bank 25 degrees to maintain a margin but increase speed to increase the rate of turn\" This option is incorrect.

The tailplane is normally operating at a negative angle of attack, producing a down load, so if the tailplane stalls and the down load is lost, the nose of the aircraft will drop and longitudinal control will be lost. Stalling of an ice contaminated tailplane could be precipitated by extension of the wing flaps. Lowering the flaps increases the downwash, and this increases the negative angle of attack of the tailplane. If the tailplane has ice contamination, this could be sufficient to cause it to stall. Recovery procedure in this situation would be to retract the flaps again, thus reducing the downwash. Take care when increasing an aircraft's forward airspeed to compensate for ice on the wings, since every knot of airspeed added to prevent wing stall brings the aircraft a knot closer to tailplane stall. Consequently, it is vital that the tailplane, like the wing, is free from contamination. This type of stall does not usually occur, but if it does, recovery is normally impossible.",

Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. Because of the higher dynamic pressure when an aircraft is operating in the transonic speed region, any shock induced buffet will have a greater potential for severe airframe damage. High speed buffet must be completely avoided. The aircraft must therefore be operated in such a manner that a (safety) margin exists before aerodynamic buffet will occur. If the variables which affect both high speed and low speed stall are considered it will be possible to identify the conditions under which buffeting will occur and a chart can be drawn to show all the factors involved. This is called a ‘Buffet Onset’ chart which is used by flight crews to ensure their aircraft is always operated with a specified minimum buffet margin. For any given combination of mass, center of gravity position and airspeed, the maximum operating altitude is that altitude at which a normal positive acceleration increment of 0.3 g, without exceeding the buffet onset boundary, is possible. It is, therefore, common practice to draw the ‘buffet-onset boundary chart’ for a range of cruise masses at 1.3 g. Any maneuver having a load factor exceeding 1.3 g will initiate the buffet onset. In this exercise: This chart is specific to an aircraft, and shows the relationship of altitude, load factor, cruise data, weight, Mach number, and IAS. The optimum speed can be found by intersecting the top of the altitude curve. In this case it is M0.80, therefore statement 1 is incorrect. Start by drawing a vertical line from M0.82 and M0.75 to the FL410 curve (first altitude curve). From here, draw a straight line from left to right that intersects the weight curves. Finally, draw a vertical up from 1.3 g load factor that intersects the lines drawn in step 2. As we can see, flying at M0.82 gives us the ability to carry a greater weight. We can then conclude that it also gives us a higher buffet onset margin, therefore statement 2 is correct.",

            "explanation": "Static longitudinal stability depends upon the relationship between angle of attack (α) and pitching moment coefficient (CM). Consideration must be given to the pitching moment contribution of each aircraft component. The pitching moment coefficients contributed by all the various components of the aircraft are summed and plotted versus lift coefficient (angle of attack). Figure 1, shows the variation of pitching moment coefficient (CM) with lift coefficient (CL) for an aircraft with positive static longitudinal stability. Static stability is shown by a return to equilibrium, or trim, upon displacement. The aeroplane described by graph A is in trim or equilibrium when CM = 0. If the aeroplane is disturbed to some different CL, the pitching moment change tends to return the aircraft to the point of trim. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some higher CL (point y), a negative or nose-down pitching moment is produced which tends to decrease angle of attack back to the trim point. If the aeroplane were disturbed to some lower CL (point x), a positive or nose-up pitching moment is developed which tends to increase the angle of attack back to the trim point. Positive static longitudinal stability is indicated by a negative slope of CM versus CL. The degree of static longitudinal stability is indicated by the slope of the curve. Effect of Wing and Tail Position (figure 2) When the aerodynamic stability of a configuration is looked at, power effects are ignored and the stability is considered by a build-up of the contributing components. If the CG is set at 30 ̊ percent MAC, the contribution of the wing alone is destabilising, as indicated by the positive slope of CM versus CL. The combination of the wing and fuselage increases the instability. The contribution of the tail alone is highly stabilising from the large negative slope of the curve. By moving the tail aft (increasing the distance to the CG) and increasing its area both contribute to the stabilising moment, which means that the slope will be steeper, making this the correct answer.",

We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Dynamic stability, on the other hand, covers what happens after this. An aircraft can only have any measurement of dynamic stability if it is first statically stable. If an aircraft is then dynamically stable, the oscillations will gradually reduce until the aircraft is back at equilibrium. Neutral dynamic stability will mean the aircraft continues to oscillate either side of equilibrium by the same amount (no damping). Dynamic instability (negative dynamic stability) means the aircraft oscillations get larger in magnitude each time. For this question, it is very important to note that any form of dynamic stability (or instability) can only come if the aircraft first has positive static stability. Without first going towards the equilibrium point, there are no oscillations to either shrink or grow. This means there is only one possible correct answer.",

When moving forward, the c.g will cause either a reduced positive lift created by the horizontal stabilizer, or an increase in negative lift. This is dependant on whether the c.g is located in front or behind the centre of pressure. Due to the decrease in positive lift or increase in negative lift of the tail, the main wing will have to compensate and produce more lift. Therefore a forward c.g will cause a higher value of wing lift. Secondly, on the right side of the figure, we can see the effect of a decrease in thrust on the aircraft at high angle of attack (slow speed flight). At high AoA the thrust will have a strong vertical component, therefore a high thrust will help lift the aircraft up and reduce the lift required. This is opposite when the thrust is reduced at high AoA, then the wings will have to compensate and create more lift to remain in level flight.",

            "explanation": "IMPORTANT NOTE: We believe that \"greater than\" is the correct answer here (and most recent feedback seems to agree), but we have varying feedback about the correct answer over the past few months. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in the real exam, thanks. Also please note that this is a very different question to 811457, as many people (understandably) have connected the two. This question is about stick force stability, the force required to hold a different airspeed, whereas 811457 is about stick force per G, the force required to pull a particular G-force, so they are very different. Figure 1 indicates the variation of stick force with airspeed and illustrates the effect of tab setting on stick force. You can see from the graph, that dependent on EAS (Equivalent Air Speed) and trim tab setting, the stick force to hold a 1 kt change in airspeed from the trimmed speed DECREASES as the trimmed speed increases. There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Therefore, holding a 5 kt difference from 70 kts would required a greater force than holding a 5 kt difference from 100 kt. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft that has positive stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed (it is a bit more nuanced than this, but this is all we need to know here). The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (i.e. a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. The neutral point is the place on an aeroplane that the CG must be in front of to make the aircraft stable in a particular axis. Its location is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin. The larger the static margin, the greater the stability, (and lower the manoeuvrability).

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime.

Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient.

            "explanation": "Centre of Pressure (CP) is considered as the point at which lift acts through, while Centre of Gravity (CG) is the point where weight of aircraft acts through. Refer to the situation 1 in diagram: The moments have to be balanced for straight and level flight. Since the CG is forward of CP, lift (L) is producing an anticlockwise moment around the CG. To balance this anticlockwise moment from lift, we need a clockwise moment from the force of the stabiliser (F). To procedure a clockwise moment from the stabiliser, a downward force will be needed. If we take moment at the point of CG, we can establish the formula Lx=F(x+y). With rearrangement we can see that F = Lx / ( x + y) Refer to situation 2 in diagram: Now if the distance between CG and CP becomes larger than before, the new formula will become Wz + Lx = F'(x+y), if we take moment at the original GC position and F’ is the new force required from the stabiliser. With rearrangement, F’ = (Wz + Lx) / (x + y). If we compare F and F’, we can see that they share the same denominator while F’ has a larger numerator (Wz + Lx > Lx), with all parameters positive real numbers). Therefore, F’ is larger than F, which means as the distance between CG and CP becomes greater, the downward balancing force of the stabiliser becomes greater as well. (In this case) Another way to visualise the situation is to plug in some convenient numbers. If lift, distance x and y are all 1, F will be 1/(1+1) = 0.5 originally (taking moment at the CG). Now, let’s say the x is increased to 2, with other parameters unchanged. Taking moment at the new CG, F’ will be 2/(2+1) = 0.67, which is larger than 0.5 previously. Notes for further learning: This question assumes lift does not change when the distance between CG and CP increases. As the force from stabiliser becomes greater, the weight will have to be reduced in order to balance the upward and downward forces in this case.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. The point where the aircraft does not have any positive or negative static longitudinal stability, and therefore is static longitudinally neutral, is called the neutral point. Placing the CG aft of this point makes the aircraft unstable, placing the CG forward of this point makes the aircraft stable.",

A dorsal fin is a small aero foil, of very low aspect ratio, mounted on top of the fuselage near the rear. A ventral fin is mounted below. If the aircraft is yawed to the right, the dorsal and ventral fins will create a side force to the right. The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). However, at small angles of yaw they are ineffective. Dorsal and ventral fins become more effective at relatively high sideslip angles. Due to their low aspect ratio, they do not tend to stall at any sideslip angle which an aircraft is likely to experience in service. While dorsal and ventral fins contribute positively to directional static stability, a dorsal fin contributes positively to lateral static stability, while a ventral fin is destabilizing in this mode and has no effect on longitudinal stability.",

To trim the airplane for higher speeds corresponding to points (2) and (3), less and less aircraft nose-up tab is required. Note that when the airplane is properly trimmed, a push force is required to increase airspeed and a pull force is required to decrease airspeed. In this manner, the airplane would have positive stick force stability with a stable “feel” for airspeed. Irrespective of the speed or the deflection of the elevators, by modifying the forces acting on the control column such that a greater pull and push force is necessary, stick-force stability is obtained. There are two devices that achieve this aim, they are the down spring (figure 2) and the bobweight (figure 3).

            "explanation": "The CM (pitching moment) vs alpha (Angle of Attack) graph is a graph depicting the longitudinal stability of an aircraft. As a very short explanation, the point where the line crosses the X-axis (Angle of Attack) is the trim position, where no pitching moment exists. As long as the gradient of the graph is negative, whenever the aircraft has a nose-up disturbance, the AoA will decrease to correct for this, and vice versa. That means that a negative gradient gives positive static longitudinal stability. The more negative the gradient of the line is, the stronger the stability. The line is not usually straight, it changes gradient due to the aircraft's design and window of stability. The CM vs alpha graph is affected by various things in the aircraft's design, including the locations of the wings and the shape of aerofoils, size of wings, etc. The CG location also massively affects the CM vs alpha graph, of course. The question is terribly worded, but really we only have to be able to say which factors a pilot can change in flight, and make sure that they actually do affect stability, and the CM vs alpha graph. Whilst the question is terrible, the answer isn't too bad. \"The centre of pressure, by changing the flap setting.\" Yes, the centre of pressure is one of the key factors determining the CM and it can be changed by changing flap setting, which is something we can do in the air. This would likely change the CM vs alpha graph completely. \"The neutral point, by varying alpha.\" The neutral point is a set location in the aircraft, determined by things such as the wing sizes and moment arms, and cannot be changed in flight. \"The centre of pressure, by varying alpha.\" Yes, again, the centre of pressure does affect the CM, and changing the angle of attack changes the CM and the gradient, strength of stability, etc., and is something that we can do in flight, of course. \"The centre of gravity, which influences the degree of pitching moment.\" This is where the question gets a bit more difficult. We are assuming that the pilot cannot change the CG during flight, but of course, some aircraft have trim tanks for that possibility, and we know that fuel burn does alter the CG, but not in a way the pilot can meaningfully control. The second part, the \"degree of pitching moment\" is also incredibly vague, and given the vague question, we agree that this option is incorrect.",

An aircraft's type of static stability is defined by its initial reaction after some external force is removed. We use the term \"static\" because we're only concerned with the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, without considering subsequent motion. Now, let's differentiate between two essential concepts: Controllability: This refers to the pilot's ability to control the aircraft using inputs. It involves the pilot's capacity to guide the airplane effectively. Manoeuvrability: This relates to the aircraft's ability to change its position or attitude in response to pilot inputs, allowing it to perform various maneuvers. CS-23 and CS-25 are certification requirements that establish standards for aircraft design and performance. These regulations mandate that an airplane must exhibit static stability and meet specific criteria for controllability and manoeuvrability. In general, an aircraft with static stability is easier to control, and its movements are more predictable. The connection between manoeuvrability and stability is such that as an aircraft's static stability increases, an aircraft equipped with a particular size of control surfaces may experience a slight reduction in manoeuvrability. This is because static stability characterizes the aircraft's capacity to reestablish its initial position following a disturbance. In essence, a statically stable aircraft tends to oppose alterations in its attitude, which can introduce increased challenges when manoeuvring, especially in specific situations.",

The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point may be imagined as the effective aerodynamic center of the entire airplane configuration, i.e. with the CG at the neutral point, all changes in net lift effectively occur at that point and no change in pitching moment results. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. For an airplane to always have positive longitudinal static stability the CG must be ahead of the neutral point, so that the wing-pitching moment always exceeds the tail plane pitching moment.

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. We see that line 3 starts off as having static longitudinal stability, as the line moves downward at first. This means that for a higher Angle of attack, a pitch down moment is induced. Towards the middle of this line, we see that the line flattens out, reducing static longitudinal stability at higher angles of attack.",

Drag increase encountered at these higher speeds is called wave drag. At and above MCRIT, the drag of the airplane wing increases rapidly and there is a large reduction of lift. If the shockwave develops earlier on wing than the other (assymetrically), the wing drops and tends to yaw creating the conditions for a coupled lateral and directional oscillation or Dutch roll.

Dutch roll is an oscillatory instability associated with swept-wing jet aircraft. It is the combination of yawing and rolling motions. When the aircraft yaws, it will develop into a roll. The yaw itself is not too significant, but the roll is much more noticeable and unstable. This is so because the aircraft suffers from a continuous reversing rolling action. Dutch roll occurs when static lateral stability is strong and static directional stability is relatively weak. Yaw dampers prevent Dutch roll on swept-wing aircraft. Dutch roll is most common at high speed and high altitude. At high altitude and high Mach number, aerodynamic damping decreases. Decreasing both altitude and Mach number should increase damping and stop the oscillation.",

            "explanation": "The most direct appreciation of the manoeuvring stability of an airplane is obtained from a plot of stick force versus load factor. The airplane with positive manoeuvring stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The manoeuvring stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive (so that pulling back equals increased G-force) but should also be of the proper magnitude, so we can't easily rip the wings off with a small input, or inversely, need to input huge forces for normal manoeuvres. This means that the stick force per g must have upper and lower limits to ensure that the airplane always has acceptable control characteristics. Stick force per G is affected by factors such as the aircraft CG, airspeed, altitude. When the pilots make an input on the controls, lets say the elevators for example, this puts a pitch moment on the aircraft, which the aircraft's natural stability fights against, this is a part of what's called \"aerodynamic damping\". At high altitudes, the high TAS reduces the change in tail angle of attack for a given pitching velocity and reduces the aerodynamic pitch damping. Thus, the aircraft becomes more manoeuvrable and less stable. This means that the stick force per G decreases (a 1G increase in load factor is easier to pull through the control column). It is also worth noting for real life flying that this makes hand-flying much more difficult at high altitudes, as very small movements are required but still produce large changes to attitude.",

We do not know whether this question is currently being asked, and we very much hope that it has been removed. Please send us any further questions or exam feedback in the comments, or by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you! The feel of an aeroplane is how much force is required to make a particular manoeuvre, often referred to in the units of \"stick force per G\" for longitudinal stability (pitch changes). Stability and manoeuvrability are intrinsically linked, in that the more manoeuvrable an aircraft is, the less stable it is, and vice-versa. Stick force per G simply measures how much force the pilot needs to exert on the controls to cause a 1G change in load factor, the higher this value, the more stable (less controllable) an aircraft is. The movement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability, as having a forward CG means that the CG is further in front of the neutral point. This means greater stability, and therefore lower manoeuvrability. A change in mass (without a change in CG) is much more complicated. It appears that mass change has an effect on the manoeuvrability that cannot be simply stated for the average aircraft, as mass and wing loading (a function of mass) appear to have opposing effects, but with different values, and the effect of different speeds for higher masses is not accounted for anywhere in the question. As you can probably tell, this is already much too complex for the ATPL exams. This is likely why the effect of mass on manoeuvring stability/stick force per G is not on the learning objectives. It is intuitive to think that a lighter aircraft is more manoeuvrable, but that is not something that can be absolutely stated without further information, and not even something the learning objectives mention. We think that the examiner has written a question to test knowledge of CG movements, assuming that their intuition on the change in weight is correct, but has ended up making a question much more complicated, which ventures outside the learning objectives. Therefore, our new recommendation here would be to answer the question assuming that the weight reduction decreases the stick force per G, even though that is not an absolute statement. This leaves us with the answer \"The stick force per g is reduced since the aeroplane is lighter, but the forward CG makes this reduction less noticeable to the pilot.\"",

            "explanation": "The lateral static stability is a measure of the airplane’s tendency to return to the wings-level attitude after a disturbance has caused the airplane to be disturbed in the rolling plane. Positive lateral static stability is the tendency of the airplane to roll to the left with a positive sideslip angle, nose to the left. Its ability to recover is dependent on the effect of sideslip. A disturbance in the rolling plane causes the angle of attack of the upgoing wing to decrease and the angle of attack of the down going wing to increase. Provided the airplane is not flying close to the stalling speed, then the upgoing wing produces less lift than it did before the disturbance and the down going wing will produce more lift than it did. Together, these changes result in a rolling moment in opposition to the initial disturbance and have a ‘roll-damping’ effect. When the roll damping exactly matches the aileron torque the airplane has a steady rate of roll. The airplane design features that increase the lateral static stability are: dihedral. sweepback. high-wing mounting. increased effective dihedral. large, high vertical fin. low CG. The airplane design features that decrease the lateral static stability are: anhedral. forward-swept wings. ventral fin. low-wing mounting. extending inboard flaps.",

This is quite a tricky question as the examiner is trying to get you confused about which stability they are discussing. The spiral dive occurs as a link between strong directional (yaw) stability but weak lateral (roll) stability. Imagine an aircraft is disturbed to roll slightly right, and therefore takes up a slight right sideslip. The large fin yaws into the turn before the aircraft can roll out of it, and this yaw causes a further bank, which again causes more yaw before the aircraft can roll out of it. During this process, the nose keeps dropping to increase airspeed to maintain lift in the turn without any increase in angle of attack. In IMC without good use of instruments, this feels like straight and level flight until the G forces start to increase noticeably, at which point the pilot would finally notice that something was wrong, as they are in a high speed spiral dive. But now back to the theory. Many aircraft have a slight spiral instability, which, even though the aircraft might be statically stable in all axes, means that a small departure from straight and level will gradually become a spiral dive if no pilot inputs are made. As this is a gradual process, it is acceptable up to a certain rate of instability as the pilot can easily override it. Being stable in the spiral mode means that the aircraft naturally tends to reduce any spiral dives to zero. If an aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then it is likely to have a strong tendency for dutch roll. For this question, though, if the aircraft is stable in the spiral mode, then the aircraft will start to roll more wings level, decreasing the rate of turn when they release the controls, decreasing the airspeed and starting to loosen the spiral, so all these parameters decrease.",

            "explanation": "This is a very complex question, but the answer is the simplest one present. The examiner has put in a lot to try and confuse you. The answer to the question is right at the top, but keep reading if you want to know more and if you want to know why the other answers are incorrect. Directional stability (stability in yaw) and lateral stability (stability in roll) are very well linked. The linkage between the two is via sideslip, the condition where the aircraft is not pointing in the same direction it is travelling through the air, so the relative airflow is arriving from one side of the nose, rather than straight on the nose. We can cause this by not flying the aircraft properly, and by flying uncoordinated, so using the ailerons without also using correct rudder, and vice-versa. LATERAL/DIRECTIONAL STABILITY Imagine that we have a left sideslip, so the aircraft is pointing forwards, but travelling to the left of that, and the relative airflow is hitting the left windshield first. A directionally stable aircraft will naturally yaw into this (nose left moment), because of the positively stable effect of the fin (vertical stabiliser), any rear strakes or ventral fin, the differential drag of the wings, etc. A laterally stable aircraft will roll away from this sideslip (right bank moment), due to the dihedral effect, sweepback, high wing effect, etc. Both of these movements decreases the sideslip, just in different ways; the aircraft can either yaw into it, or roll away from it. Most civilian aircraft are both laterally and directionally stable at once, in equal measure. If the stability becomes too high on one or the other, then it can cause either Dutch Roll or Spiral Instability. DUTCH ROLL Too much lateral stability and not enough directional stability can cause a periodic motion of sideslip and overcorrection which we call Dutch Roll. Imagine an aircraft with very long, dihedral wings, but a small tail fin. SPIRAL INSTABILITY The opposite of Dutch Roll, Spiral Instability is where we have too much directional stability but not enough lateral stability, which causes an increasing bank angle, with the aircraft constantly yawing further to keep the turn coordinated and ending up in a spiral dive. It is an aperiodic motion (it only happens once, not back and forth). Imagine a large tail fin and short, non-dihedral wings. So in terms of this question, we have already seen the correct answer, \"Lateral and directional stabilities interact through sideslip, which is created when using either aileron or rudder alone.\". Whilst there are other ways to create sideslip, this is a very common one. For two other options, we should mention that the rudder and ailerons are not contributors to stability. They are control surfaces, and the pilot has direct control over them. Stability has to be natural within the aircraft. If it takes a pilot to remove the sideslip, then the aircraft is not that stable. In a stable aircraft, we manipulate the ailerons and rudder against the natural stability of the aircraft design. For the final option remaining, most aircraft would enter a spiral dive under the conditions mentioned in the question (depending on the extent of the deflection). However, with stronger lateral stability, the aircraft would be able to resist the spiral dive. Extra directional stability would just make a spiral dive easier to enter. So you could say that lateral stability is too weak, but not both lateral and directional stabilities.",

Sweepback factsheet: A Swept Wing Increases the Critical Mach Number (MCRIT). All other effects from a swept wing are by-products, most of them disadvantages. However, the benefits from a higher MCRIT outweigh the associated disadvantages. Increased tendency to stall at the tip first: Tip stall can lead to pitch-up, a major disadvantage. Pitch-up can give the tendency for a swept wing aircraft to Super Stall. Aircraft that show a significant tendency to pitch-up at the stall must be fitted with a stall prevention device, a stick pusher. When compared to a straight wing of the same section, a swept wing is less aerodynamically efficient. At a given angle of attack CL is less, which increases the stall speed. CLMAX is less and occurs at a higher angle of attack. The lift curve has a smaller gradient (change in CL per degree change in alpha is less). Swept wings must be fitted with complex high lift devices, both leading and trailing edge, to give a reasonable take-off and landing distance. A swept wing must be flown at a higher angle of attack than a straight wing to give the required lift coefficient; this is most noticeable at low speeds. A swept wing makes a small positive contribution to static directional stability. A swept wing makes a significant positive contribution to static lateral stability. At speeds higher than MCRIT a swept wing generates a nose-down pitching moment, a phenomenon known as Tuck Under. The hinge line of trailing edge ‘flap’ type control surfaces is not at right angles to the airflow, which reduces the efficiency of the controls.",

This is the point where the resultant vector of lift is said to be operating. As the airfoil or Angle of attack changes (thus changing the lift coefficient), this pressure field will change and so will the center of pressure. Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. Place the CG beyond the aft limit and the aircraft is too unstable, having excessive manoeuvrability. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose. For this specific question, we can see that line 1 is the most longitudinally unstable aircraft and line 4 is the most longitudinally stable aircraft. With this information we can derive that the CG position is further aft at line 1 compared to line 4.",

For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment: - The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by an arm (distance from wing CP to CG). - The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm (distance from tailplane CP to CG). The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG directly affects the magnitude of the longitudinal static stability, the tailplane downforce and the stalling speed because its position determines the length of the arm of any restoring moment. A forward movement of the CG increases the positive longitudinal static stability of an aircraft but decreases the manoeuvrability and control response because the moment arm is increased in length and increases the nose-down pitching moment. Thus, the required downforce on the tailplane increases.",

The placement (forward/aft) of the CG is incredibly important to longitudinal stability (stability in pitch movements), as having a forward CG means that the effect of any movement affects the tailplane more than the main wing and the rest of the aircraft, and it has a greater stabilising effect (like the fins on a dart). The \"neutral point\" is the where the CG would be for the aircraft to have NEUTRAL static stability (in pitch).

The location of the neutral point is decided by the aerodynamic surfaces and qualities of the aircraft only. The distance between the neutral point and the CG is called the static margin.

At high altitude, a large high-speed jet transport aircraft will be cruising at a speed marginally above its critical Mach number, and it will have a small shock wave on the wing. If such an aircraft overspeeds, the shock wave will rapidly grow larger, causing the static pressure to increase sharply in the immediate vicinity of the shock wave. The locally increased adverse pressure gradient will cause the boundary layer to separate immediately behind the shock wave. This is called a ‘shock stall’. Shock induced separation (shock stall) at high speed can also cause buffeting. Aerodynamic buffet is a valuable stall warning, but it can damage the aircraft structure. As the shock wave moves aft over the surface of the wing, the CP also moves aft. This aft movement combined with the reduced downwash at the tail plane due to the presence of the shockwave will lead to Tuck Under. As we can see, from all the options, shock stall, mach buffet and tuck under only occur when operating above MCRIT (transonic speed regime). Dutch roll occurs when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) and may occur at Mach numbers below the critical Mach number.",

Please put any further exam feedback you can remember in the comments or send by email to info@atplquestions.com, thank you very much. Pilot-induced oscillations are where the pilot \"over-controls\" the aircraft, and therefore, will not only correct for an incorrect attitude, altitude, speed, etc., but will over-correct, and go through the equilibrium, ending up in the opposite scenario. This can often be seen on a pilot's first few ILS approaches when they begin to get very accurate near the runway, or during the flare, when pilots sometimes over-flare, and end up porpoising (up and down) along the runway. It is very common in many stages of flight, and something to try and avoid. Autopilots can perform self-induced oscillations too, if they are not quick enough to catch the overcontrolling with their feedback loop, for example. This could be in pitch, or in yaw and roll (which could lead to Dutch roll). This question is very vague, it does not tell us what oscillations we are feeling, nor much about how they have been formed, so we have chosen the most vague answer that is correct (it could also be Dutch roll, but we would have to make a lot more assumptions, so we think that \"Dutch roll\" is not as correct).",

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

When a small sideslip is introduced, the strong directional stability tends to restore the nose into the wind while the relatively weak “dihedral effect” lags in restoring the aeroplane laterally. The rate of divergence in the spiral motion is usually so gradual that the pilot can control the tendency without difficulty. Spiral instability is normally considered less objectionable than oscillatory instability, so most aircraft are designed to be spirally unstable. With this characteristic, when the aircraft is yawed, either by the prolonged application of rudder or asymmetric power, a rolling moment in the direction of yaw occurs and the aircraft quickly enters a spiral dive. This can occur when flying at low airspeeds under asymmetric power conditions, when excessive yaw due to too much power is coupled with insufficient rudder control to balance it, and may quickly place an aircraft in a dangerous attitude.",

Aircraft longitudinal stability is directly related to Centre of Gravity (CG) position. An aircraft with a more forward CG is more longitudinally stable than an aircraft with a more aft CG. Placing the CG beyond the forward limit can cause an unacceptably high value of longitudinal stability, decreasing manoeuvrability by a significant amount. If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, an increase in Angle of Attack (α) results in a negative pitching moment. The nose will slightly fall down, decreasing the Angle of Attack. If this aircraft has a decrease of Angle of Attack, the nose will come slightly upwards again, creating a positive pitching moment again by slightly raising the nose.",

A variation of CG position can cause large changes in the static longitudinal stability. In the conventional airplane configuration, the large changes in stability with CG variation are primarily due to the large changes in the wing contribution. If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Noticeable changes in static stability can occur at high lift coefficients (low speed). This condition is The curve of CM versus CL of this illustration shows a good stable slope at low values of CL (high speed). Increasing CL gives a slight decrease in the negative slope hence a decrease in stability occurs. With continued increase in CL, the slope becomes zero and neutral stability exists. Eventually, the slope becomes positive and the airplane becomes unstable.",

The line of action of this force is well aft of the aircraft CG, giving a yawing moment to the left (a stabilizing effect). Directional stability is, consequently, increased. Dorsal fins are effectively an extension of the tail fin, so increase directional (yaw) and lateral (roll) stability, like the tail fin does.

Dutch roll can occur when the static lateral stability (caused by dihedral, etc.) is high in comparison to the static directional stability (caused by the tail fin, etc.) Asymmetric shockwaves Modern transport jet aircraft tend to cruise at high altitudes with high Mach numbers, very close to - or just inside - the transonic regime. This is the range of speeds (At and above MCRIT) where some of the aircraft experiences supersonic airflow, but not all the aircraft does. This brings rise to shockwaves, first on the upper wing surfaces near the roots, then spreading to other areas of the aircraft. Shockwaves produce quite high drag forces, classed as \"wave drag\". If the shockwaves form asymmetrically on the aircraft, whether due to different airflow patterns over the wings, small differences in the aircraft structure, control surfaces, etc., then the different drag forces can cause a yawing motion, which sets off the oscillation known as Dutch roll. This Dutch roll would be made worse by the shockwaves forming on the faster wing, reducing lift and increasing drag to drop it down and drag it back, exacerbating the Dutch roll.",

If this movement is the result of an undesirable disturbance, then the ability of the airplane to return to its original heading without the assistance of any control-surface movement is a measure of its directional static stability. It is a measure of the aircraft’s ability to realign itself with the relative airflow. Sideslip is the displacement angle of the airplane’s longitudinal axis in azimuth from the relative airflow. It is positive when the relative airflow is to the right of the longitudinal axis and negative when the relative airflow is left of the longitudinal axis. An airplane has directional static stability if, when in a sideslip with the airflow coming from the left initially the nose tends to yaw left. An airplane that has excessive directional static stability compared to its lateral static stability is more prone to spiral dive.",

Any disturbance causes changes to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane that are complex, particularly if the displacement is to its directional stability because it affects the airplane in both the yawing and rolling planes. An airplane that is statically stable is not necessarily dynamically stable. However, for an airplane to be dynamically stable it must be statically stable. In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability. An airplane that has positive static stability may be dynamically neutral, stable, or unstable; but an airplane that is statically unstable can never attain dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of an airplane is dependent on the airplane design, its speed, and the altitude at which it is flying. There are five states of dynamic stability and for each of them the airplane must have positive static stability. Negative dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the passage of time. Neutral dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant with the passage of time. Positive dynamic stability – the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the passage of time. ‘Dead beat’ positive dynamic stability – the oscillations cease immediately because they are heavily damped. ‘Divergent’ negative dynamic stability – the oscillations cease because the motion completely diverges from the original motion.",

            "explanation": "The most direct appreciation of the maneuvering stability of an airplane is obtained from a plot of stick force versus load factor. The airplane with positive maneuvering stability should demonstrate a steady increase in stick force with increase in load factor or “g”. The maneuvering stick force gradient - or stick force per “g” - must be positive but should be of the proper magnitude. The stick force gradient must not be excessively high, or the airplane will be difficult and tiring to maneuver. Also, the stick force gradient must not be too low, or the airplane may be overstressed inadvertently when light control forces exist. When the airplane has high static stability, the maneuvering stability will be high, and a high stick force gradient will result. A possibility exists that the forward CG limit could be set to prevent an excessively high maneuvering stick force gradient. As the CG moves aft, the stick force gradient decreases with decreasing maneuvering stability and the lower limit of stick force gradient may be reached. The aft limit, which for safety reasons on a transport airplane is always forward of the neutral point, is confined by insufficient stick-force stability and/or excessive in-flight maneuverability. The minimum stick force per ‘g’ for the maximum permitted load factor, which is 2.5 for large transport airplanes, determines the aft limit of the CG envelope. This means that with a more aft CG, a smaller force is required to achieve a given load factor. If the CG is more aft than anticipated and a force is applied with the same magnitude, the limit load factor may be exceeded.",

Static Longitudinal stability is the aircraft's natural tendency when disturbed in pitch, to return to its former trimmed angle of attack without pilot input, and is desirable throughout the aircraft's complete speed range. For the study of stability, we consider the changes in magnitude of lift force due to changes in angle of attack, acting through a stationary point, the aerodynamic centre (AC). There are two moments to consider: the wing moment and the tail moment. The wing moment is a function of the change in wing lift multiplied by arm ‘x’. The tail moment is a function of the change in tailplane lift multiplied by arm ‘y’. The length of both arms is dependent upon CG position. If the CG is considered in a more forward position, the tail arm is larger and the wing arm is smaller. A more forward CG position increases static longitudinal stability. If the nose-down (negative) tail moment is greater than the nose-up (positive) wing moment, the aircraft will have static longitudinal stability. NEUTRAL POINT If you consider the CG moving rearwards from a position of static longitudinal stability: - the tail arm ‘y’ will decrease and the wing arm ‘x’ will increase; - the (negative) tail moment will decrease and the (positive) wing moment will increase. Eventually the CG will reach a position at which the tail moment is the same as the wing moment. If a vertical gust displaces the aircraft nose-up, the sum of the moments will be zero and there will be no angular acceleration about the CG to return the aircraft towards its original position of equilibrium. Because there is no resultant moment, either nose-up or nose-down, the aircraft will remain in its new position of equilibrium; the aircraft will have neutral static longitudinal stability. The position of the CG when the sum of the changes in the tail moment and wing moment caused by the gust is zero is known as the neutral point.",

The sideslip angle (β) is the displacement aircraft centre-line from the relative airflow. By convention it is positive when the relative airflow is displaced to the right of the aircraft centre-line. The sideslip gives the symmetrical fin an angle of attack equal to the sideslip angle. This produces a small aerodynamic force, which, when multiplied by the distance from the centre of gravity, produces a strong restoring moment, and yaws the aircraft back to its original equilibrium position. A swept wing provides a stable contribution depending on the amount of sweepback, which increases with increase in CL (i.e. at lower IAS). This contribution is relatively weak when compared with other components. The inclination of the forward, right, wing to the relative airflow is greater than that of the rearward wing, so there is more lift and, hence, more induced drag, on the right side. The result of this discrepancy in drag on the two sides of the wing is a yawing moment to the right, which tends to eliminate the sideslip. This is a stabilizing effect, and may be important if the sweepback angle is quite large.",

In other words, it cannot have long-term stability without first having short-term stability.

There are a few factors at play that cause this, including the change to elevator displacement, effect of the trim tab, dynamic pressure change, etc. This means that holding the aircraft 10 kts from its trimmed speed requires less stick force at a high trimmed speed than if it were trimmed at low speed. Stick position stability exists when the aircraft responds \"correctly\" to a push or pull. For example, pushing the stick causes a pitch down and an airspeed increase (this is binary, an aircraft either has stick position stability or it doesn't). Stick force stability is a further continuation of that, and in an aircraft has stick force stability, a greater push force produces a greater increase in airspeed. The level of stick force stability is proportional to the slope of the curve of stick force vs. speed (annex above). The steeper the curve, the higher the stick force stability (a 1 kt change to airspeed requires more force).",

In an aircraft, it may be achieved manually, by an electrohydraulic system, or by aerodynamic means. This type of damping is dependent on the viscosity of the air for its success. The denser the atmosphere, the faster the unwanted movement will be extinguished When we make a control input, for instance a roll to the right, there is a resistance against this input due to \"aerodynamic damping\", which in this case, is where the down-going (right) wing gains an increased angle of attack as it is travelling down slightly, changing the relative airflow. This increases the lift slightly and resists the roll a little. This effect is influenced by air density, and in the low density of higher altitudes, the aircraft is travelling at a higher TAS, which means that the angle of attack change is smaller. This is a reduction in aerodynamic damping. All the control axes have natural aerodynamic damping in some form. which are reduced at high altitude. At an ISA altitude of 40 000 ft, aerodynamic damping would be reduced to one-half the ISA sea level value. High altitude, and consequently low density (high TAS), reduces aerodynamic damping, and therefore reduces dynamic stability on all axes.",

            "explanation": "DUTCH ROLL. This is an oscillation involving roll, yaw and sideslip. Because of these characteristics of the Dutch roll oscillation, lateral dynamic stability has always been more of a problem than longitudinal dynamic stability. With a dominant lateral stability this will, when a yaw is introduced, roll the aircraft due to the lift increase on the wing into the wind. The increased induced drag on the rising wing will yaw the aircraft in the opposite direction, reversing the coupled oscillations. This is called Dutch roll. Dutch roll might occur when the lateral stability is large compared to the directional stability. Therefore, the moments involved are roll and yaw. With increasing altitude (decreasing density) or increasing Mach number, the possibility of a Dutch roll increases. The CG position has little influence on the lateral stability, but an aft CG will reduce the directional stability because the Moment Arm of the stabilizing moment from the fin will decrease and thus increasing the likelihood of a Dutch roll. To reduce the aircraft tendency to Dutch roll, either the lateral stability should be decreased or the directional stability increased => anhedral would decrease the lateral stability. Aircraft with a tendency to Dutch roll are also fitted with yaw damper. This automatically displaces the rudder proportional to the rate of yaw to damp out the oscillation. Note: Dutch roll is a result of high Lateral stability with relatively low Directional stability. Furthermore, Longitudinal stability is not a factor.",

If the incidence of all surfaces remains fixed, the effect of CG position on static longitudinal stability is typified by the chart in figure 1: As the CG is gradually moved aft, the airplane static stability decreases, then becomes neutral then unstable. The CG position which produces zero slope and neutral static stability is referred to as the “neutral point”. The neutral point defines the most aft CG position without static instability. Positive static stability is indicated by the curve with negative slope. Moving the CG forward, will increase static longitudinal stability and this is represented by a (steeper) negative slope. Neutral static stability would be the result if the curve had zero slope. If neutral stability existed, the airplane could be disturbed to some higher or lower lift coefficient without change in pitching moment coefficient. An airplane which demonstrates a positive slope of the CM versus CL curve would be unstable.",

We can think of stability like a dart, the further forward the mass, and the further backwards all the aerodynamic bits (the fins), the more stable an aircraft is. This is why a dart is very nose heavy. This shows us that the further forward the CG, the greater the stability. Each component has its own effect on aircraft stability, in each axis. So the fuselage's effect actually depends on the fuselage and CG position, but it usually destabilising, due to the large nose that sticks out ahead of the CG, but the tail fin (vertical stabiliser) is massively stabilising, because it is a large aerodynamic surface at the rear of the aircraft. Shifting the CG backwards makes the whole aircraft more tail heavy, which reduces the stability of every element of the aircraft, and reduces the overall stability in every axis except lateral (roll), therefore including directional (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch).",

This is the same for any pitch changes. The other axes have less obvious \"positive\" and \"negative\" directions, so engineers just picked one and now use it as convention. Therefore, a roll to the right of is \"positive\" and to the left is \"negative\". Again, this is the same when the roll angle changes. Yaw is more difficult: as pilots we could refer to it in terms of heading (right is positive again here), but that would not be useful for aerodynamic calculations, so instead we use the sideslip angle. Sideslip angle (β) is the displacement angle of the airplane’s longitudinal axis in azimuth from the relative airflow. If the relative airflow comes from the right of the aircraft, that means a positive sideslip (+β), and if the relative airflow is from the left of the aircraft, that is negative sideslip (-β). The actual yawing moment (cn) of an aircraft is then considered a positive yawing moment (+cn) if it is to the right, or a negative yawing moment (-cn) if it is to the left. Therefore, for a directionally stable aircraft, a negative sideslip angle would cause a negative yawing moment, as",
