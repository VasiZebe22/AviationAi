Forward CG means that we have a longer arm between CG and CP where lift acts. However, the distance between CG and the tail is not increased by the same proportion. Therefore tailplane needs to produce more downforce LT (drag) to balance. This means that when the centre of gravity is moved beyond its forward limit, drag is increased. This drag increase causes the range of the aircraft to decrease.

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch, but the more downforce at the elevator is required to change the pitch attitude. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and horizontal stabiliser, called as \"trim tanks\", have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons: To provide extra fuel capacity. To maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum (aft) position for minimum drag, improved manoeuvrability and, as a consequence, for maximum fuel economy, as less downforce on the horizontal stabiliser is required. The fuel in these tanks may automatically drain as fuel is used from the centre and wing tanks or may be actively controlled by the crew through transfer systems.",

In order to counteract the resultant downward pitch of the aircraft's nose, the tailplane must generate a compensatory downward force, akin to the mechanism of a seesaw. This corrective force induces an upward movement of the elevators, which unfortunately amplifies drag, thereby intensifying fuel consumption and curtailing the aircraft's range and endurance.

When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively controllable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward longitudinal control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight. If the CG is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the CP diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane beyond acceptable limits and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable. Generally, the less stable the aircraft, the more controllable and vice versa.",

In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. None of the structural or performance limitations are permitted to be exceeded. In order to ensure the aircraft remains within all of the limitations, a calculation is required to check which is the most restrictive on that particular flight. The single most restrictive limitation is called the allowed takeoff mass (ATOM) and is the lowest of performance limited takeoff mas (PLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM).

When you create more lift, you create more induced drag, and your performance goes down. The aircraft cruises slower with a forward CG location because of increased drag. The drag is increased because a higher AoA and much downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. This pitch down moment has to be corrected by an up deflection of the elevator to keep straight and level flight. This increases the aircraft’s weight by adding a high downward force.

To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer (between the front and the rear CG limit). Proper CG location is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controllability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage: As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. When the CG is at the forward limit, the aircraft's nose may become too heavy making it difficult to raise the nose during landing, leading to a higher likelihood of landing on the nose wheel rather than the main wheels.",

The position of the CP changes with speed and as alpha changes, whilst the position of CG changes as load and fuel change. When this happens, new balancing forces and trim changes will be needed. The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

            "explanation": "The total mass of the aircraft can be said to act through one point, called the Centre of Gravity (CG) and the total lift acts through the Centre of Pressure (CP). The position of the CP changes with speed and as alpha changes, whilst the position of CG changes as load and fuel change. When this happens, new balancing forces and trim changes will be needed. The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. For this question, if during flight a considerable amount of fuel was transferred from a fuel tank located in the forward fuselage section to a fuel tank located at the rear section of the fuselage, the aircraft's CG will be repositioned aft. To sum up, an aft CG: Increases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Decreases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM can be increased The stick forces required will be less Rotation will be easier Stall speed decreases, which permits a higher ceiling altitude Makes flare easier during landing, thus decreasing LDR and increasing MLM Range and Endurance increase due to the decreased fuel consumption",

An increase in weight requires increased lift, more lift equals more drag and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Increasing mass also affects the stall speed, VS, which is roughly proportional to the square root of weight. Many speeds used in performance calculations, such as the rotate speed, VR and the safety spped, V2, are extracted through graphs and tables and are based on the stalling speed from which they differ by a standard safety margin according to the rules and regulations. So, they also increase as the aircraft weight increases, so as to keep the safety margin constant. In case an additional baggage container is loaded into the aft cargo compartment without being entered into the load and trim sheet, then the VS will increase, but the take-off safety speeds will remain the same, thus reducing their difference from the VS and as a result the safety margin will also reduce.",

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch, but the more downforce at the elevator is required to change the pitch attitude. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

But, they may also be found in the fin and the horizontal stabiliser. The Centre of Gravity (CG) position does change as fuel is burnt off, but within defined limits. If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and horizontal stabiliser, called as \"trim tanks\", have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons: To provide extra fuel capacity. To maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum (aft) position for minimum drag, improved manoeuvrability and, as a consequence, for maximum fuel economy, as less downforce on the horizontal stabiliser is required. The fuel in these tanks may automatically drain as fuel is used from the centre and wing tanks or may be actively controlled by the crew through transfer systems.",

In order to counteract the resultant downward pitch of the aircraft's nose, the tailplane must generate a compensatory downward force, akin to the mechanism of a seesaw. This corrective force induces an upward movement of the elevators, which unfortunately amplifies drag, thereby intensifying fuel consumption and curtailing the aircraft's range and endurance. This elevation in downward force exerted by the tailplane can be likened to an increase in overall weight. Consequently, the stall speed of the aircraft also increases.

The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively controllable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward longitudinal control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight. If the CG is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the CP diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane beyond acceptable limits and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable. Generally, the less stable the aircraft, the more controllable and vice versa.",

In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. None of the structural or performance limitations are permitted to be exceeded. In order to ensure the aircraft remains within all of the limitations, a calculation is required to check which is the most restrictive on that particular flight. The single most restrictive limitation is called the allowed takeoff mass (ATOM) and is the lowest of performance limited takeoff mas (PLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM).

The drag is increased because a higher AoA and much downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. This pitch down moment has to be corrected by an up deflection of the elevator to keep straight and level flight. This increases the aircraft’s weight by adding a high downward force.

To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer (between the front and the rear CG limit). Proper CG location is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controllability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage: As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. When the CG is at the forward limit, the aircraft's nose may become too heavy making it difficult to raise the nose during landing, leading to a higher likelihood of landing on the nose wheel rather than the main wheels.",

The position of the CP changes with speed and as alpha changes, whilst the position of CG changes as load and fuel change. When this happens, new balancing forces and trim changes will be needed. The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

Many speeds used in performance calculations, such as the rotate speed, VR and the safety spped, V2, are extracted through graphs and tables and are based on the stalling speed from which they differ by a standard safety margin according to the rules and regulations. So, they also increase as the aircraft weight increases, so as to keep the safety margin constant.

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively manoeuvrable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward pitch control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight.",

Traffic Load (TL) is the total mass of passengers, baggage, cargo (or freight), including any non-revenue load. Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. Landing fuel is the remaining fuel in the tanks on landing. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Landing situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Max Allowed Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel (Block fuel - Taxi fuel) = 4 200 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 15 kg) = 1 120 kg. Landing situation: Performance Limited Landing Mass - DOM - Landing fuel (Block - Trip -Taxi fuel) = 3 610 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 440 kg - 15 kg) = 970 kg.

One IG of water weighs ten libres. To convert fuel volumes into fuel masses, we need to know that fuel is lighter than water. A volume of AVGAS weighs approximately 73% of the equivalent volume of water, which means that its Specific Gravity (SG) is approximately 0.73. This means that an IG of AVGAS weighs: 10 x 0.73 lb = 7.3 lb. Thus, 1 USG will weigh: 7.3 lb x 0.83 IG = 6 lb.",

            "explanation": "Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is the maximum permissible mass of an aeroplane with no usable fuel. The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. Due to the necessity of using the mass of fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks to balance the internal load, there is a restriction on the amount of weight that can be placed in the fuselage before fuel must be added to the wing tanks. Exceeding the MZFM limit can result in significant structural damage to the aircraft. The greatest stress on the wing roots happens when the wing fuel tanks are empty. To prevent the wings from permanently bending upward as fuel is used, manufacturers impose a maximum zero fuel mass on the structure. Since the stress during flight is at its greatest when the wing fuel tanks are empty, MZFM is determined during approach for landing. Fuel jettison is a procedure used to quickly reduce the weight of an aircraft by releasing fuel into the atmosphere. This procedure is typically performed in emergency situations when an aircraft needs to land but is too heavy to do so safely. Note: The option 'Immediately after fuel jettison (IFJ)' is not considered the correct option, because fuel jettison does not necessarily mean getting rid of all the fuel.",

However, threshold lights may protrude above the plane, if their height above the end of the runway is 0.66 metres (or 26 inches) or less and if they are located to each side of the runway. Also, the clearway may not be greater than 50% of the TORA and should extend at least 75 metres either side of the centre line. The TORA (Take-Off Run Available) plus the clearway make the TODA (Take-Off Distance Available).",

The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aeroplane less the usable fuel (DOM + Traffic Load or TOM - Fuel). For this question we will only consider the Zero-fuel and Take-off situations (ignoring the landing situation, since the given data do not permit so), subtracting from the Allowed Take-off Mass (ATOM) and the Maximum Zero-Fuel Mass (MZFM) structural limits the Actual ZFM and the fuel mass (where applicable), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: ATOM - Actual ZFM - TOF = 76720 kg - 55063 kg - 16299 kg = 5358 kg underloaded. MZFM - Actual ZFM = 62731 kg - 55063 kg = 7668 kg underload. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and then apply the additional cargo of 4500 kg we will check out if we are finally underloaded or overloaded and by how much: 5358 kg - 4500 kg = 858 kg underloaded. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

To convert from volumes to mass or mass to volumes, you need the Specific Gravity of the fuel: The Specific Gravity (SG) shows the relationship between litres and kilograms or between pounds and imperial gallons. Specific Gravity 0.80 means that a volume of fuel weighs 80% of the equivalent volume of water. For this question, 650 lb of fuel has a fuel volume of: 650 lb / 10 / 0.80 = 81 IG. And, since 1 IG = 1.2 USG, then: 81 IG = 81 x 1.2 = 97 USG. NOTES: 1. Fuel volume is measured in: Imperial Gallons (IG), US Gallons (USG) or litres (l or lt). 2. Fuel mass is measured in:, tonnes (t or ton), kilograms (kg) or pounds (lb).",

According to the question, we will need an extra amount of fuel, 8 300 kg, so as to ensure that this amount will be on board when landing in Paris. Additionally, taxi fuel, 180 kg, is required. So, adding the above fuel amounts, we get the Minimum Block Fuel: 7 054 kg + 8 300 kg + 180 kg = 15 534 kg, which is less than 22 000 kg, so we are within limits in terms of tank capacity. Also, check if with the above Minimum Block Fuel, 15534 kg, any maximum fuel load than can be loaded for both take-off and landing situations is exceeded, by subtracting the Dry Operating Mass and the Traffic Load from the two allowed structural limits given: Take-off: 69 002 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 16 390 kg (more than 15 534 kg, so we are within limits). Landing: 63 360 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 10 748 kg (more than 8 300 kg, so we are within limits). Note: No information has been given about the fuel cost of this extra fuel weight on the first flight. In real life we calculate for this using the flight plan adjustment figures or rules of thumb but the examiner obviously did not want to add the extra complexity of that to this question so has chosen to ignore it completely. This is good for us, of course, as it makes the question easier. Video Explanation:",

            "explanation": "This question, like many others, tests knowledge of both various mass definitions and also their relationship to each other. An ability to sketch and understand a diagram, is considered an essential skill in this subject. CAP 696 defines Operating Mass (OM) as the DOM plus fuel but without traffic load. Taking this definition further, the Basic Empty Mass (BEM) plus the Variable Load (VL) equal the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). To the DOM, if fuel is added then we arrive at the Operating Mass (OM). This fuel is normally take-off fuel prior to flight and usable fuel after take-off. More detailed definitions of both BEM and DOM from CAP 696 are found here: Basic Empty Mass (Basic Mass) is the mass of an aeroplane plus standard items such as: unusable fuel and other unusable fluids; lubricating oil in engine and auxiliary units; fire extinguishers; pyrotechnics; emergency oxygen equipment; supplementary electronic equipment. Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as: Crew and crew baggage. Catering and removable passenger service equipment. Potable water and lavatory chemicals. Food and beverages Note: The term 'variable load' is not directly defined in CAP 696 but the details are listed in the definition of DOM, as above.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",

The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question, we will consider the take-off and landing situations, subtracting from the Maximum Permissible Take-off Mass and the Performance Limited Landing Mass limits the OM, the TL and the fuel masses (as required), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Max TOM - OM - TL = 6400 - 4480 - 1870 = + 50 kg. Max LM - (OM- Trip fuel) - TL = 5430 - (4480-1090) - 1870 = + 170 kg. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and the \"+\" sign indicates that it is underloaded by 50 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Regarding this question, it's worth noting that all the options are given in kilograms. Additionally, the question provides a fuel density of 0.8, which means we can't directly utilize the \"kg\" data from the provided figure. Instead, we need to calculate the total usable fuel in liters and then apply the fuel density (x 0.8). Assuming the pilot decides to refuel only the wing tanks, both inner and outer, for the aforementioned purposes, the total available fuel on-board will be: [(Outer tanks x 2) + (Inner tanks x 2)] x 0.8 = [(880 ltr x 2) + (6 924 ltr x 2)] x 0.8 = 12 486 kg",

Forward CG means that we have a longer arm between CG and CP where lift acts. However, the distance between CG and the tail is not increased by the same proportion. Therefore tailplane needs to produce more downforce LT (drag) to balance. This means that when the centre of gravity is moved beyond its forward limit, drag is increased. This drag increase causes the range of the aircraft to decrease.

The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch, but the more downforce at the elevator is required to change the pitch attitude. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

But, they may also be found in the fin and the horizontal stabiliser. The Centre of Gravity (CG) position does change as fuel is burnt off, but within defined limits. If it is burnt from a tank aft of the aircraft's CG, then the CG will move forward. Conversely, if the fuel is burnt from a tank positioned forward of the CG, then it will move aft. Over the years, fuel tanks in the tail fin and horizontal stabiliser, called as \"trim tanks\", have been employed by different manufacturers for two main reasons: To provide extra fuel capacity. To maintain the aircraft CG position at the optimum (aft) position for minimum drag, improved manoeuvrability and, as a consequence, for maximum fuel economy, as less downforce on the horizontal stabiliser is required. The fuel in these tanks may automatically drain as fuel is used from the centre and wing tanks or may be actively controlled by the crew through transfer systems.",

For an aircraft, this is the most forward point because then the main wing will be producing the most lift. With the cg furthest ahead of the centre of pressure, the horizontal stabilizer will be producing a downwards force, which the main wings will have to compensate for by producing more lift. The main wings will therefore have to be at a higher angle of attack and therefore be closer to the stall. Hence the stall will occur at higher speeds with a forward CG then with a rearward CG. Minimum control speeds are also determined with the least favourible conditions. When considering an engine failure, we know that the aircraft will rotate around its CG, but the distance of the moment doesn’t change when it moves fore or aft, the engines moment would only change when we move it along the lateral axis of the aircraft. However, the position of the CG will influence the rudder arm, and hence the rudder moment. A CG on the af limit will provide a small arm and therefore the least ability to oppose the yawing moment of the engine failure.",

Most transport aircraft will usually have their aft CG limit just forward of the CP, because that provides to an aircraft pitch stability. If the CP is aft of the CG, the increased lift vector will tip the aircraft nose down, which is a stable result as it tends to restore the original pitch attitude. In this case, the aircraft has positive longitudinal static stability. If the CG is aft of the CP, thus positioned behind the aft limit, the increased lift will tip the aircraft nose up, leading to higher angles of attack and even more lift until the aircraft stalls. This is an unstable result, a negative longitudinal static stability, where: The control forces will be light. The aircraft will be excessively controllable, leading to a possible over rotation on take-off and a possible tail scrape and during landing over pitching may occur during the flare. Insufficient forward longitudinal control will be available to keep the aircraft level in straight flight. If the CG is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the CP diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane beyond acceptable limits and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable. Generally, the less stable the aircraft, the more controllable and vice versa.",

When we do our take-off performance calculations for a specific runway in specific conditions, the main factor (and often the figure we are trying to find) is our maximum take-off mass (MTOM). In actual fact, there are many different MTOMs, and we have to find the most limiting, which will be the lowest of the set. None of the structural or performance limitations are permitted to be exceeded. In order to ensure the aircraft remains within all of the limitations, a calculation is required to check which is the most restrictive on that particular flight. The single most restrictive limitation is called the allowed takeoff mass (ATOM) and is the lowest of performance limited takeoff mas (PLTOM) and maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM). The most limiting (smallest value) of these will be the one where our aircraft will struggle most for performance.",

When you create more lift, you create more induced drag, and your performance goes down. The aircraft cruises slower with a forward CG location because of increased drag. The drag is increased because a higher AoA and much downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. This pitch down moment has to be corrected by an up deflection of the elevator to keep straight and level flight. This increases the aircraft’s weight by adding a high downward force.

Proper CG location is crucial for maintaining the aircraft's stability and controllability. Beginning from the middle of the fuselage: As the CG shifts towards the aircraft's nose, stability increases while maneuverability decreases. As the CG moves towards the tail, maneuverability improves, but stability diminishes. A more stable aircraft is less controllable and vice versa. Excessive stability leads to higher control stick forces, making it more challenging for the pilot to manage. On the other hand, excessive maneuverability results in instability and difficulty in controlling the aircraft. When the CG is at the forward limit, the aircraft's nose may become too heavy making it difficult to raise the nose during landing, leading to a higher likelihood of landing on the nose wheel rather than the main wheels.",

The position of the CP changes with speed and as alpha changes, whilst the position of CG changes as load and fuel change. When this happens, new balancing forces and trim changes will be needed. The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. In summary, the effects of a forward CG position are the following: Decreases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Increases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM must be decreased The stick forces required will be more Rotation will be more difficult Stall speed increases, thus ceiling decreases Makes flare more difficult during landing, thus increasing LDR and decreasing MLM Due to the increased fuel consumption, the fuel mileage (nautical miles covered per kg of fuel mass) decrease",

            "explanation": "The total mass of the aircraft can be said to act through one point, called the Centre of Gravity (CG) and the total lift acts through the Centre of Pressure (CP). The position of the CP changes with speed and as alpha changes, whilst the position of CG changes as load and fuel change. When this happens, new balancing forces and trim changes will be needed. The relative positions of the CG and CP affect the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. In practice, the CG is usually forward of the CP, thus, the more forward the CG, the more stable the aircraft in pitch. Some stability in pitch is desirable, but not too much, because the extra down force on the elevator effectively adds to the aircraft weight and requires the lift to be increased to counter it. More lift means more drag created by the trim (trim drag) and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers determine a safe range for the CG. The aft limit is usually just in front of the Centre of Pressure, but it provides less stability than that provided by the forward limit, but a smaller balancing tail moment will be required. For this question, if during flight a considerable amount of fuel was transferred from a fuel tank located in the forward fuselage section to a fuel tank located at the rear section of the fuselage, the aircraft's CG will be repositioned aft. To sum up, an aft CG: Increases the Rate of Climb and the Climb gradient Decreases TORR, TODR, ASDR, thus MTOM can be increased The stick forces required will be less Rotation will be easier Stall speed decreases, which permits a higher ceiling altitude Makes flare easier during landing, thus decreasing LDR and increasing MLM Range and Endurance increase due to the decreased fuel consumption",

An increase in weight requires increased lift, more lift equals more drag and more drag means higher fuel consumption. Increasing mass also affects the stall speed, VS, which is roughly proportional to the square root of weight. Many speeds used in performance calculations, such as the rotate speed, VR and the safety spped, V2, are extracted through graphs and tables and are based on the stalling speed from which they differ by a standard safety margin according to the rules and regulations. So, they also increase as the aircraft weight increases, so as to keep the safety margin constant. In case an additional baggage container is loaded into the aft cargo compartment without being entered into the load and trim sheet, then the VS will increase, but the take-off safety speeds will remain the same, thus reducing their difference from the VS and as a result the safety margin will also reduce.",

For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Landing situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Max Allowed Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel (Block fuel - Taxi fuel) = 4 200 kg - 2 230 kg - (865 kg - 15 kg) = 1 120 kg.

One IG of water weighs ten libres. To convert fuel volumes into fuel masses, we need to know that fuel is lighter than water.

Therefore, we can load 12 300 + 400 = 12 700 kg, and we will still take off with 12 300 kg Alternatively, follow the steps described in the annex to calculate the underload (extra load that can be uplifted) and thereafter, add it to the fuel which has already been loaded. There is no need to consider the ZFM. The underload is 1400 kg.

            "explanation": "Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is the maximum permissible mass of an aeroplane with no usable fuel. The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. Due to the necessity of using the mass of fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks to balance the internal load, there is a restriction on the amount of weight that can be placed in the fuselage before fuel must be added to the wing tanks. Exceeding the MZFM limit can result in significant structural damage to the aircraft. The greatest stress on the wing roots happens when the wing fuel tanks are empty. To prevent the wings from permanently bending upward as fuel is used, manufacturers impose a maximum zero fuel mass on the structure. Since the stress during flight is at its greatest when the wing fuel tanks are empty, MZFM is determined during approach for landing. Fuel jettison is a procedure used to quickly reduce the weight of an aircraft by releasing fuel into the atmosphere. This procedure is typically performed in emergency situations when an aircraft needs to land but is too heavy to do so safely. Note: The option 'Immediately after fuel jettison (IFJ)' is not considered the correct option, because fuel jettison does not necessarily mean getting rid of all the fuel.",

The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question we will only consider the take-off situation (ignoring the landing and the zero-fuel situation, since the given data do not permit so) subtracting from the Allowed Take-off mass structural limit, the OM and the Traffic load to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Allowed TOM - OM - Traffic Load = 4 300 kg - 3 296 kg - 1 014 kg = - 10 kg. The \"-\" sign indicates that it is overloaded by 10 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aeroplane less the usable fuel (DOM + Traffic Load or TOM - Fuel). For this question we will only consider the Zero-fuel and Take-off situations (ignoring the landing situation, since the given data do not permit so), subtracting from the Allowed Take-off Mass (ATOM) and the Maximum Zero-Fuel Mass (MZFM) structural limits the Actual ZFM and the fuel mass (where applicable), to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: ATOM - Actual ZFM - TOF = 76720 kg - 55063 kg - 16299 kg = 5358 kg underloaded. MZFM - Actual ZFM = 62731 kg - 55063 kg = 7668 kg underload. We will select the lowest of the two numbers and then apply the additional cargo of 4500 kg we will check out if we are finally underloaded or overloaded and by how much: 5358 kg - 4500 kg = 858 kg underloaded. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

This question requires familiarity with standard mass values, given that no specific mass data is provided within the question. Regarding these standard mass values, there is no indication whether the scenario involves a holiday charter or not. Consequently, we will proceed under the assumption that it does not, as typically, the question explicitly states when it refers to such occasions. Referring to the table provided below, we can derive the following masses: For adults: 84 kg each For children: 35 kg each Baggage for intercontinental flights: 15 kg per item Calculation: Adults: 8 x 84 kg = 672 kg Children: 2 x 35 kg = 70 kg Baggage: 5 x 15 kg = 75 kg Total added traffic load = 817 kg Adding this to the initial traffic load of 25 110 kg, we obtain a total traffic load of 25 927 kg. Standard mass values according to CAP 696: Mass Values for Passengers: 20 Passenger Seats or more Passenger seats 20 or more 30 or more Male Female All adult All flights except holiday charters 88 kg 70 kg 84 kg Holiday charters 83 kg 69 kg 76 kg Children 35 kg 35 kg 35 kg Mass Values for Baggage: 20 Passenger Seats or more Type of Flight Baggage Standard Mass Domestic 11 kg Within the European Region 13 kg Intercontinental 15 kg All other 13 kg Note: It's common knowledge that the A330 has over 30 passenger seats.",

FLAPS 0° 10° 15° RUNWAY 4100 kg 4400 kg 4600 kg CLIMB 4700 kg 4500 kg 4200 kg step 1) The lowest from each flap setting: (0°) 4100; (10°) 4400; (15°) 4200. step 2) The highest of those 3 selected is 4400 kg from 10° flaps.

Traffic Load (TL) is the total mass of passengers, baggage, cargo (or freight), including any non-revenue load. Traffic Load plus Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is equal to the aircraft's Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM). Take-off Mass (TOM) is the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run. It is equal to the ZFM plus the take-off fuel. Take-off fuel is the remaining fuel at the brake release point after having consumed the taxi fuel. For this question, we will only consider the Take-off and Zero-fuel situation, subtracting from all the structural limits the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) and the fuel mass (where applicable), to find the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded and we will keep the lowest one: Take-off situation: Maximum Take off Mass - DOM - Take off fuel = 71 204 kg - 40 195 kg - (13 800 kg - 215 kg) = 17 424 kg. Zero Fuel situation: Maximum Zero Fuel Mass - DOM = 56490 kg - 40195 kg = 16 295 kg. Therefore, the Maximum Allowed Traffic Load that can be loaded for this flight is 16 295 kg.",

The mass includes items such as crew and crew baggage, catering and removable passenger service equipment, potable water and lavatory chemicals, food and beverages. Operating Mass (OM) is the DOM plus fuel, but without traffic load. For this question we will only consider the take-off situation (ignoring the landing and the zero-fuel situation, since the given data do not permit so) subtracting from the Allowed Take-off mass structural limit the OM and the Traffic load to figure out if the aircraft is overloaded or underloaded: Allowed TOM - OM - Traffic Load = 4300 - 3253 - 1015 = + 32 kg. The \"+\" sign indicates that it is underloaded by 32 kg. NOTE: Be careful to avoid any double mass calculations, due to the fact that some masses are already included in other masses, e.g. fuel mass is included in OM, crew and crew baggage mass is included in DOM, DOM is included in OM and so on.",

According to the question, we will need an extra amount of fuel, 8 300 kg, so as to ensure that this amount will be on board when landing in Paris. Additionally, taxi fuel, 180 kg, is required. So, adding the above fuel amounts, we get the Minimum Block Fuel: 7 054 kg + 8 300 kg + 180 kg = 15 534 kg, which is less than 22 000 kg, so we are within limits in terms of tank capacity. Also, check if with the above Minimum Block Fuel, 15534 kg, any maximum fuel load than can be loaded for both take-off and landing situations is exceeded, by subtracting the Dry Operating Mass and the Traffic Load from the two allowed structural limits given: Take-off: 69 002 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 16 390 kg (more than 15 534 kg, so we are within limits). Landing: 63 360 kg - 42 123 kg - 10 489 kg = 10 748 kg (more than 8 300 kg, so we are within limits). Note: No information has been given about the fuel cost of this extra fuel weight on the first flight. In real life we calculate for this using the flight plan adjustment figures or rules of thumb but the examiner obviously did not want to add the extra complexity of that to this question so has chosen to ignore it completely. This is good for us, of course, as it makes the question easier. Video Explanation:",

An ability to sketch and understand a diagram, is considered an essential skill in this subject. CAP 696 defines Operating Mass (OM) as the DOM plus fuel but without traffic load. Taking this definition further, the Basic Empty Mass (BEM) plus the Variable Load (VL) equal the Dry Operating Mass (DOM). To the DOM, if fuel is added then we arrive at the Operating Mass (OM). This fuel is normally take-off fuel prior to flight and usable fuel after take-off. More detailed definitions of both BEM and DOM from CAP 696 are found here: Basic Empty Mass (Basic Mass) is the mass of an aeroplane plus standard items such as: unusable fuel and other unusable fluids; lubricating oil in engine and auxiliary units; fire extinguishers; pyrotechnics; emergency oxygen equipment; supplementary electronic equipment. Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding usable fuel and traffic load. The mass includes items such as: Crew and crew baggage. Catering and removable passenger service equipment. Potable water and lavatory chemicals. Food and beverages Note: The term 'variable load' is not directly defined in CAP 696 but the details are listed in the definition of DOM, as above.",

The MZFM is a structural limit based on the bending moments of the wing root. All extra weight above the MZFM must comprise fuel only. The added fuel, which is invariably carried in the wing increases its stiffness and reduces its bending and torsion (twisting). Fuel being stored in the wings is a useful feature, as the weight of the fuel counteracts the lift generated and gives relief to the roots of the cantilever wing. However, with no fuel, the wings are light, and the fuselage is heavy, which causes a large moment at the root of the wing. Therefore, the maximum zero-fuel weight implies a protection to the wing root against being overstressed. As long as it is not exceeded, lack of large amounts of fuel in the wings will not cause failure at the wing roots because of bending.",
